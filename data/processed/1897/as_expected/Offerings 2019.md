Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product

Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt securities is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum are

as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”). Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling such debt securities or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JANUARY 28, 2019**


**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

## PARTS EUROPE S.A.


### €175,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2022

Parts Europe S.A. (formerly Autodis S.A.), a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of France (the “Issuer”), is offering
(the “Offering”) €175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2022 (the “Senior Secured
Notes”).

The Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR plus % per annum, reset quarterly. The Issuer
will pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes quarterly in arrears on each of February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1, commencing on
May 1, 2019. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on May 1, 2022.

At any time on or after the Issue Date (as defined herein), the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured Notes at the
redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Additionally, upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control or upon
certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes. A change of control, however, will not
be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the
event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, ranking senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future
debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and ranking pari passu in right of payment with the
Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined
herein), the Existing Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein) and future hedging obligations (if any). The Senior Secured Notes will be
guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by Parts Holding Europe S.A.S. (formerly Autodis Group S.A.S.), a société par
_actions simplifiée organized and existing under the laws of France, the direct parent company of the Issuer (the “Parent Guarantor”), and_
Autodistribution S.A.S., a société par actions simplifiée organized and existing under the laws of France, a direct subsidiary of the Issuer (the
“Subsidiary Guarantor” and together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantees rank senior in right of payment to the
respective Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee and rank pari passu in right of
payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by (i) a first-priority pledge of the share capital of Dakar Acquisition S.A., the indirect parent
company of the Issuer (“LuxCo 6”); (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, material bank accounts and material intragroup receivables
of the Parent Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings); (iv) a
first-priority security interest over certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A.S., Magenta Auto Pièces
S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, its material bank accounts and its material intragroup receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of
(A) the capital stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution
S.A.S., (B) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material bank accounts and (C) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material intragroup receivables (the
“Collateral”). The Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) (the “Super Senior Obligations”) are secured by
first-priority security interests over, among other things, the Collateral, contractually ranking pari passu with the security interests securing
the Senior Secured Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of enforcement of the security
interests over the Collateral, holders of Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the Super Senior Obligations
have been repaid. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the
Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors are subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” The Senior Secured Notes will_
be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes and effectively
subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including the Super Senior Obligations, that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets. The Revolving Credit
Facility is guaranteed by, and is secured by certain assets of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee or provide security in
favor of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes will be represented on issuance by one or more Global Notes (as defined herein), which we expect will be
delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) on or
about, 2019 (the “Issue Date”). Interests in each Global Note will be exchangeable for the definitive Senior Secured Notes only in
certain limited circumstances. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to
deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that
the Senior Secured Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes will be
granted or that such listing will be maintained.

INVESTING IN THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. SEE “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING
ON PAGE 31 FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISKS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE INVESTING IN THE SENIOR
SECURED NOTES.


**Issue price of the Senior Secured Notes:** **%, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date.**

The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Senior Secured Notes are being offered and sold in the
United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and outside the
United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers that are qualified
institutional buyers are hereby notified that the seller of the Senior Secured Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of
Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Transfer

professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”). Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations
and projections about future events. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this
Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, risks
and uncertainties related to our business, strategy, capital expenditures, projected costs and our plans and
objectives for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk” and similar
expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance.

In addition, any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and
we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this
Offering Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this
Offering Memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results
include:

   - the impact of material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network and increases in
transportation costs;

   - the ability of third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements;

   - the impact of French, Benelux, Italian and worldwide economic and other conditions on demand for
our products;

   - the risk that our growth strategy may not be successful;

   - our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our network;

v


-----

   - the risk that our customers’ financial difficulties require us to write off debts;

   - the impact of competition in the spare parts distribution industry;

   - our reliance on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks and the length of service
intervals;

   - failure to successfully anticipate demand or manage our inventory and services;

   - disruption of our information technology (“IT”) systems;

   - failure or interruption in software or information systems licensed from third parties;

   - the increasing use of technology in our industry;

   - failure to maintain or improve our brand image;

   - an ineffective marketing and communication strategy;

   - failure by our suppliers to comply with ethical business practices or applicable laws and regulations;

   - coverage of our liabilities by insurance;

   - the impact of our lease obligations on our operating flexibility;

   - theft in our warehouses and other facilities;

   - the impact of price and margin pressures;

   - the termination of our affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors;

   - lower sales from, or a deterioration of our relationship with, our distributors and branded garages;

   - our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

   - the impact of changes in laws and regulations, including in relation to labor, employment and tax and
our inability to use French tax loss carry-forwards;

   - the risk of having to pay indemnities in connection with our divested Polish subsidiary;

   - the deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions;

   - the impact of higher employment costs;

   - the impact of environmental, health and safety regulations;

   - the risk associated with fluctuations in our working capital requirements;

   - material losses as a result of product liability and warranty claims;

   - reliance on certain certifications for the operation of our Trucks segment;

   - the impact of legal and arbitration proceedings;

   - our failure to comply with tax regulations and actions by tax authorities and increase of VAT rates;

   - the impact of changes in accounting standards;

   - the impact of competition and antitrust laws; and

   - other risks associated with our financing, the Senior Secured Notes and our structure discussed under
“Risk factors.”

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations
in “Summary,” “Risk factors” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
_operations.” Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect_
our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly
changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such
risk factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results.

This Offering Memorandum contains market and competitive position data from industry publications and
from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources believed to be reliable by management. These
third-party sources include Roland Berger and INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes
_Economiques). The providers of the data reports do not warrant, represent or guarantee the accuracy and_
completeness of any information in this Offering Memorandum, and neither do the providers of the data reports
accept any responsibility or liability to any party who relies on any information contained in this Offering
Memorandum. Research by Roland Berger should not be considered as the opinion of Roland Berger as to the
value of any security or the advisability of investing in the Issuer or any of their respective affiliates. Research by
Roland Berger is based on publicly available information which has not been independently verified by Roland
Berger, as well as certain assumptions, general assessments, projections and experience derived from Roland
Berger’s consulting activities, in each case as at the time of the study’s preparation.

We believe that these industry publications, surveys and studies are reliable. We cannot, however, assure
you of the accuracy and completeness of such information, and we have not independently verified such industry
and market data. Industry and consultant publications and forecasts generally state that the information they
contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed. While we believe that each of the studies and publications we have used is
reliable, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the data that were extracted or derived
from these industry and consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness.
Market data and statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions.
Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both
the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be
included in the relevant market.

While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such
data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed
under “Risk factors.” As far as we are aware and have been able to ascertain from information published by such
third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, we have made statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding our industry and our position
in the industry based on our experience and our own investigation of market conditions. Market share figures
presented herein are based on revenue and exclude tires, oil, accessories and consumables. Market share figures
of the Group provided herein are based on total network sales, which is calculated as our revenue plus estimated
sales of our independent affiliated distributors, as applicable. References to the “core” Western European light
vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket excludes tires, oil, accessories and consumables, and references to the
“core” truck spare parts distribution and repair aftermarket in France includes distribution of spare parts and
repair and maintenance services and does not include OEM parts sales, labor and workshop margins on spare
parts. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you that any of these statements are accurate or correctly
reflect our position in the industry, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any
independent sources.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

**Financial statements presented**

We have included in this Offering Memorandum the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent
Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, and the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018, with corresponding unaudited income statement and cash flow data for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017.

The Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating business, operations or significant assets other
than in connection with its incorporation and the Refinancing, investments in its subsidiaries and intragroup
loans, and is not required to, and does not, prepare consolidated financial statements. The Issuer is a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor and the results of operations and financial position of the Issuer
are included in the Parent Guarantor’s consolidated financial statements.

Consequently, only limited historical financial information relating to the Issuer is available, and no
financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum. See “Risk factors—
_Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is_
_a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash from its_
_operating subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes.” Unless specified otherwise, all_
historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Parent Guarantor and its
subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor guarantees the Senior Secured Notes on a senior secured basis. Accordingly,
all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of financial information in this Offering
Memorandum are to the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

The audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). The unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018, with corresponding unaudited financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2017,
included herein have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting,” the IFRS standard
applicable to interim financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas in which
assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our audited consolidated
financial statements. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
_operations—Critical accounting policies.”_

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering
and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own
professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and generally accepted auditing
principles in the United States and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this
Offering Memorandum.

The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30,
2018, included in this Offering Memorandum, has been derived by adding the consolidated financial information
of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, to the consolidated financial
information of the Parent Guarantor for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and subtracting the
consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The
financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our
financial condition at any future date. This information has not been audited or reviewed by any auditors.

The contents of any website, including the websites of Bain Capital, the Issuer or any member of the Group,
do not form any part of this Offering Memorandum.

**Pro Forma Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of
the Parent Guarantor for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, adjusted to give full-year effect to the
acquisitions made during the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 (see note 3 to the unaudited interim

viii


-----

condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and note 5.1.1 to the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor included in this Offering Memorandum), and of the acquisitions of
Verviers Freins and Oscaro (each as defined below) completed in October and November 2018 (see “Summary—
_Recent developments”) and related synergies and cost saving measures (collectively, the “Pro Forma Financial_
Information”). The financial information for Verviers Freins and Oscaro has not been derived from accounts
prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and does not represent what our actual results would have been had the aforementioned
transactions occurred on October 1, 2017, nor does it purport to project our results of operation at any future date.
The Pro Forma Financial Information included in this Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, IFRS or U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting Pro Forma Financial Information have
been audited in accordance with French generally accepted accounting standards, International Accounting
Standards or U.S. generally accepted accounting standards. In evaluating the Pro Forma Financial Information,
you should carefully consider our audited historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

The Pro Forma Financial Information is based upon available information and assumptions that we believe
are reasonable but are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have actually been achieved if the
aforementioned transactions had been completed on the dates indicated, or indicative of the results that may be
achieved in the future. The Pro Forma Financial Information is provided for information purposes only.

**Segment reporting**

Throughout this Offering Memorandum, we present our financial results by segment. These segments
correspond to the Parent Guarantor’s reporting segments in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments.” Our
operating segments consist of the following:

   - _Light Vehicle France segment, which includes the activities of:_

(i) the central purchasing units (“CPUs”) dedicated to the supply of spare parts for Light Vehicle
France to both our wholly-owned distributors and our network of affiliated independent
distributors;

(ii) Logisteo, a central automated warehouse from which spare parts for Light Vehicle France are
distributed, the other parts being supplied directly by the suppliers;

(iii) Cora, a logistics platform in France for spare parts for light vehicles, specialized in the body parts
business;

(iv) ACR, a logistical platform for spare parts for light vehicles, with a strong exposure to online
dealers;

(v) Mondial Pare-Brise, a specialist in the repair and replacement of windshields in France, acquired
in 2017;

(vi) our network of wholly-owned distributors in France, who sell light vehicle spare parts to garages
that provide repair and maintenance services for light vehicles; and

(vii) headquarters costs attributable to the Light Vehicle France segment.

   - _Trucks segment, which includes the activities of:_

(i) the CPUs, which are dedicated to the supply of spare parts for trucks to both our wholly-owned
distributors and our network of affiliated independent distributors;

(ii) Bremstar, a national platform for trucks;

(iii) our network of wholly-owned distributors in France selling spare parts for trucks to garages that
provide repair and maintenance services; and

web dealers;

ix


-----

(ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies (including G-Group, acquired in
June 2018); and

(iii) Geevers, since June 2018.

Our operations in Poland, sold in August 2017, have not been included in the Light Vehicle International
segment since the disposal thereof and are accounted for as discontinued operations in the financial statements
presented in this Offering Memorandum.

In the future, we will report Verviers Freins, acquired in October 2018, in our Light Vehicle International
segment and we will report Oscaro, acquired in November 2018, in a new, separate segment.

**Other financial measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA organic growth, Revenue organic growth, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, operating cash flow, cash conversion, change in working capital and change in working capital margin
(collectively, the “Non-IFRS measures”) (each as defined by us) that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, SEC requirements, IFRS or the accounting standards of any other jurisdiction. We have
included these measures because management uses them to measure operating performance in presentations to
our directors and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, as well as for monitoring certain aspects of our
cash flows from operating activities and liquidity. Our Non-IFRS measures are defined by us as follows:

   - “Adjusted capital expenditure” represents capital expenditure excluding the one-off investments made
in our new automated Logisteo platform. For a reconciliation of Adjusted capital expenditures to
capital expenditures, see footnote 4 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other
_information”;_

   - “Adjusted EBITDA” represents operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses (as included in our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015,
2016 and 2017, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018) and as adjusted for
certain non-cash items and certain items we believe are non-recurring, or otherwise not reflective of the
ongoing performance of our business, including start-up costs related to new businesses, income and
expenses attributable to the implementation of our transformation plan, fees paid to our shareholders
and exceptional one-off expenses related to professional conferences. Adjusted EBITDA is presented
because we believe it is a relevant measure for assessing performance and cash flows and thus aids in
understanding our profitability for a given period. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to
operating income from ordinary activities, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated
_financial and other information”;_

   - “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by
revenue;

   - “Adjusted EBITDA organic growth” and “Revenue organic growth” between two periods (N and N-1)
are determined as follows:

(a) in respect of acquisitions made in period N, by deducting, from the period N revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated in period N by
acquisitions;

(b) in respect of acquisitions made in period N-1, by deducting from the period N and period N-1
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated in
period N and N-1 by such acquisitions; and

(c) in respect of disposals, by deducting, from the period N and N-1 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA,
the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated by disposed activities made in
period N and in period N-1 up to their disposal.

From time to time we acquire, sell or close individual sites or businesses as part of our ongoing network
management. These transactions are considered not material over the historical period and are deemed to be part
of organic growth;

   - “cash conversion,” expressed as a percentage, represents Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted capital
expenditure divided by Adjusted EBITDA;

x


-----

   - “change in working capital” represents the change in inventories, trade payables, trade receivables and
other receivables and payables;

   - “change in working capital margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as change in working
capital divided by revenue;

   - “Operating cash flow” represents Adjusted EBITDA, net of Adjusted capital expenditure and including
the change in working capital. For a reconciliation of operating cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA, see
footnote 5 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information—Other financial
_and pro forma data”; and_

   - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” represents Adjusted EBITDA after giving pro forma effect to the
acquisitions made during the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, and the acquisitions of
Verviers Freins and Oscaro completed in October 2018 and November 2018, respectively. For a
reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to operating income from ordinary activities, see
footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information.”

We present Non-IFRS measures for informational purposes only. There can be no assurance that items we
have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be
incurred in the future. The calculations of the Non-IFRS measures are based on various assumptions and
management estimates. These amounts have not been and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or
verified by any independent accounting firm.

We present the Non-IFRS measures because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our
operating performance and ability to service our debt and because our management uses these measures to assess
our liquidity and operating performance. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to other
indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance
with IFRS.

Our Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Our Non-IFRS measures may not give an
accurate or complete picture of our results or transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to
our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum
and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. The limitations with respect to our
Non-IFRS measures include:

   - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

   - they do not reflect any cash income taxes and certain other taxes that we may be required to pay;

   - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of
cash flows;

   - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

   - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and the Non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

Other companies in our industry may calculate the Non-IFRS measures differently than we do, which may
limit their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS measures and related
ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our
business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations or reduce our indebtedness.
You should rely primarily on our IFRS results and use these Non-IFRS measures only as a supplement to
evaluate our performance.

**Restatements**

Unless otherwise specified, financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2016 presented in the Offering Memorandum has been restated to take into account the application of
IFRS 15 and IFRS 5.

xi


-----

**_IFRS 15—Revenue recognition_**

We elected to early adopt IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2017, relating to revenue recognition from contracts with
customers, using the full retrospective method, which requires restatement of each prior reporting period
presented. We applied this full retrospective method to restate our financial statements for the two years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2016. The most significant impact of the IFRS 15 standard relates to the sales of spare
parts, equipment and tools delivered directly by suppliers to independent distributors that do not transit through
our logistics platforms as they are directly delivered by suppliers to independent distributors (referred to as direct
sales transactions). Historically under IAS 18 we bear the inventory and credit risks of these products and
therefore are considered a principal in these transactions. Under IFRS 15, the guidance focuses on the transfer of
control of the products rather than the risks and, accordingly, we are considered an agent, rather than the
principal in those transactions. Therefore for the direct sales transactions, only the net amount that we retain as a
commission is recognized as revenue. This accounting better reflects our strategy to focus on transactions
involving our logistics platforms rather than direct flow transactions which do not pass through our platforms.
The IFRS 15 impacts that we have identified are mainly driven by the new principal versus agent application
guidance as explained above.

The adoption of IFRS 15 resulted in a reversal of cost of goods sold for purchase of goods from the
suppliers and a corresponding reversal of revenue previously recognized for direct sales to distributors for the
same amount. The remaining revenue represents the commission the Group earned for direct sales transactions,
including discounts received from suppliers and discounts given to the distributors. The adoption therefore had
no impact on our EBITDA or operating income in any reporting period and had no impact on the consolidated
reserves as of January 1, 2017. Adoption of the standard also did not impact the assets and liabilities on the
consolidated statement of financial position nor cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. Restatements to the previously reported results due to the adoption of the
new standard on our consolidated income statements are described in note 4 to the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, included in
this Offering Memorandum.

**_IFRS 5—Discontinued operations_**

On August 4, 2017, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our subsidiary in Poland, AD Polska. AD
Polska was classified as discontinued operations in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and in the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2017. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, our consolidated income
statements for years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 have been restated to exclude the impact of the disposed
business. Restatements to the previously reported results due to discontinued operations on our consolidated
income statements are described in note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent
Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, included in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures contained in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information, market
data and certain operating data, have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, the
sum of the numbers in a column or a row in tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that
column or row or the sum of certain numbers presented as a percentage may not conform exactly to the total
percentage given.

Our financial statements are presented in euro rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. Therefore,
discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur due to such rounding.

_Secured Notes._

_Unless otherwise indicated, the financial and operational data presented herein do not include Verviers_
_Freins and Oscaro._

**Overview**

We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux and Italy, with over 55 years of experience. Since
the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline) distributor
in the business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) segments. We
hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by our unique operational model and value-added
services proposition, our history of organic growth and value-accretive acquisition-led growth as well as our
strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, we generated revenue of
€1,379.2 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €128.2 million. After giving effect to the acquisitions of Verviers
Freins and Oscaro, we had a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €168.5 million for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018.

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017. We also hold
leading positions around the rest of Western Europe and, in 2017, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM
distributor in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands.

We have strengthened our leading position in France with the acquisition of Oscaro, the French leader in
online sales of light vehicle spare parts. Oscaro is one of the first online players to offer new spare parts from
manufacturers and wholesalers, generating the majority of its revenue from the B2C (DIY) segment. Oscaro
offers approximately 1 million SKUs and operates mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in other markets such
as Spain. We expect the acquisition of Oscaro to help develop our international presence online, as we intend to
roll out Oscaro’s online sales platform to other countries in which we operate.

We operate our business through three operational segments which address the light vehicle independent
aftermarket in France (“Light Vehicle France”), certain light vehicle independent aftermarkets in Benelux and
Italy (“Light Vehicle International”) and the truck independent aftermarket in France (“Trucks”). The pie charts
below show the breakdown of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, by segment and by customer.
In the future, we will report Oscaro in a new, separate segment.

We operate in the French, Benelux and Italian independent aftermarkets. In recent years, we have grown
externally through strategic acquisitions to develop our international presence, such as with the acquisitions of
Doyen Auto in 2016, Geevers Auto Parts B.V. (“Geevers”) in May 2018 and Verviers Freins in October 2018 in
Benelux, and the acquisitions of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car in 2017 and Genfin S.r.l. and its subsidiaries
constituting the G-Group (“G-Group”) in June 2018 in Italy. We have also grown through strategic acquisitions
to expand our complementary product offerings, such as with the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise in 2017,
giving us access to the windscreen and window (“auto glass”) replacement market.

We operate in the independent aftermarkets segment within the growing and resilient Western European
light vehicle spare parts distribution “core” aftermarket and the stable and mature truck spare parts distribution
and repair “core” aftermarket in France. The independent aftermarkets segment in which we operate is generally
outperforming or on par with original equipment car and truck dealer networks and the wider core aftermarkets.
The overall Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is expected to grow between 1% and
3% per annum over the 2017 to 2022 period, with growth in the independent aftermarkets forecast to exceed or
be on par with this growth over the same period while gaining market share from original equipment car dealer
networks. The overall truck spare parts distribution and repair “core” aftermarket in France is forecast to grow at
a CAGR of 0.8% over the 2017 to 2022 period, with the independent aftermarkets holding stable market share
and forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.7% over the same period. Key market drivers for both the light vehicle and
truck independent aftermarkets are expected to be favorable during the 2017 to 2022 period, including a growing
and aging addressable car parc and rising prices due to the increasing complexity of spare parts.

One of our key strengths is our control over the value chain through our proven multi-channel operational
model that delivers superior product availability and best-in-class delivery lead times. Our distribution is carried
out by a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who
distribute our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail
locations and online players. Our ability to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and
distribution, through to customers has a strong impact on margins. For example, our automated platforms enable
us to centralize more flows, which in turn generates logistics fees from suppliers. Generally, the logistics fees we
charge to suppliers are greater than the logistics costs we incur. Our unique operational model is founded on our
excellent relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms, extensive Western
European distribution network and a broad and loyal base of customers to which we deliver a wide range of
value-added services, leading to customer loyalty. Our operational model is based on four components:
procurement and suppliers, upstream logistics control, local distribution and customers, as shown in the graphic
below.

Our model is based on the distinctive, dual proposition of distributing products to customers coupled with
providing value-added services (many of which are digital or online services) to both suppliers and customers.
To suppliers, we offer a unique access to a wide, diversified and fragmented customer base, which suppliers are
not able to efficiently address themselves. We also offer suppliers a number of value-added services, such as


2


-----

marketing support and access to our state-of-the-art automated warehousing capabilities which allow suppliers to
arrange deliveries to a single delivery point. To customers, we provide a comprehensive product offering and
best-in-class delivery times combined with value-added services, such as commercial, technical and training
support, strong and integrated branding and online tools, which cultivate high customer loyalty and drive market
share gain.

Our revenue grew from €914 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to €1.4 billion for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2018, with an average organic growth rate of approximately 3% per annum over the
period. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our Adjusted EBITDA was €67.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA
margin was 7.3%. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was €128.2 million and
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.3%.

**Our strengths**

**_Growing, resilient and highly visible Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket, with IAMs_**
**_outperforming the overall market_**

We operate in the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket, which has forecasted
revenue growth of 1% to 3% over the 2017 to 2022 period. Within this market, the IAMs in which we operate
show particular strength and growth potential due to two long-term market dynamics: the stable, slightly
increasing Western European car parc and an increase in average vehicle age are expected to drive growth in the
number of cars that can be serviced by light vehicle IAM distributors like us in the coming years. Additionally,
increasing vehicle complexity and computerization of car systems is expected to drive increased prices and job
frequency.

In addition, the Western European light vehicle IAM tends to be resilient in the face of macroeconomic
factors that impact the automotive industry and distribution markets generally. While new car sales tend to
fluctuate with economic cycles, the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket benefits from a slightly but
steadily growing installed car parc, due to the ongoing need for repairs to be made on the existing car parc
regardless of downturns in the economy. For example, even when new car purchases declined in France
following the financial crisis (from approximately 2.2 million in 2009 to approximately 1.8 million in 2014), the
French car parc and the French light vehicle spare parts market continued to grow steadily in size because new
car sales only account for a small portion of the overall car parc. Approximately 2.1 million new cars were sold
in France in 2017, compared with a car parc of approximately 40 million cars in total. The light vehicle IAM is
also relatively less affected by economic downturns because, as new car sales decrease, the existing car parc’s
age and mileage increase, thereby increasing the need for maintenance and repair. In economic downturns
customers are more price-sensitive, and IAMs distributors, such as us, are generally more price-competitive than
OE car dealer networks.

Light vehicle IAM distributors also have the benefit of a high level of visibility in terms of the future
addressable market of cars needing service and repair. The addressable market for the light vehicle IAM is cars
aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts
and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a result, we can project the size and composition
of the car parc that will require service in the five to ten-year range because parc size, vehicle types and installed
technology are known from the point of production. We generally service cars over a long period of time (from
five to twenty years), which may require multiple repairs and parts replacements over their lifespan.
Additionally, we distribute parts for cars that span the entire car parc, covering a wide range of makes and
models, and giving us a wider addressable market, as compared to our OE car dealer network competitors who
generally distribute parts for cars from just one manufacturer.

Moreover, we are able to offer lower prices than our OEM counterparts as IAM spare parts prices are on
average 30% lower than those of equivalent OEM-branded spare parts. Furthermore, in France, T-1 technicians
working for our distributor customers cost on average €45 to €60 per hour, while equivalent technicians working
for an OEM distributor would cost on average €70 to €110 per hour (depending on location). We therefore
benefit from being on average 30% less expensive than our OEM counterparts, both from the standpoint of
product prices and of labor costs, which we believe makes us the preferred solution for end-customers,
particularly after their original car warranty has expired.

As a result of the factors described above, growth of the light vehicle IAM is forecast to exceed or be on par
with the growth of the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket on the whole, for all of Western Europe and also
on a country by country basis, for the 2017 to 2022 period. The Western European light vehicle IAM has
historically outperformed both the broader market and its OE car dealer network competitors, a trend which is


3


-----

expected to continue in the 2017 to 2022 period. Between 2014 and 2017, the Western European light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket grew at a CAGR of 1.8%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc,
while the Western European light vehicle IAM grew more quickly, at a CAGR of 2.9%, further driven by aging
of this growing car parc. From 2017 to 2022, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is
forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.6%, while the Western European light vehicle IAM is forecast to grow more
quickly, at a CAGR of 2.0%. Additionally, the Western European light vehicle IAM is consequently expected to
continue gaining market share over the same period, growing from 59% of the market (in terms of revenue) in
2017 to 60% of the market in 2022.

**_A leading independent B2B and B2C (DIY) spare parts distributor strongly positioned in the attractive_**
**_Western European light vehicle and truck IAMs_**

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017. We also hold
leading positions around Western Europe and, in 2017, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM distributor
in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands. We believe that
the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018 will strengthen our position in the light vehicle spare parts market in
France as well as our online capabilities, such that we are the only multichannel B2B, B2C (DIY) and
business-to-consumer player in the independent aftermarket auto parts distribution sector in Europe. Oscaro had
approximately 2.5 million customers and received approximately 345,000 orders a month in 2017. Oscaro had
sales of approximately €325 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approximately €308 million for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2018.

In addition to the Western European market being highly attractive, there are barriers to entry in the Western
European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket and scale benefits favor larger distributors. These barriers to
entry include the extensive logistics, technology and network investments that are necessary to service a broad
and fragmented customer base seeking supply of several million SKUs for rapid and continuous delivery and the
difficulty in building sufficient brand awareness and long-term relationships with suppliers that are necessary to
negotiate competitive pricing. Additionally, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is
fragmented, with significant potential for consolidation, giving an edge to large distributors, such as us, who are
able to service the entire value chain and make strategic acquisitions.

We have outperformed the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket and the light vehicle IAM in
France. Over the 2014 to 2017 period, our Light Vehicle France segment revenue had an average organic growth
rate of 3.4%, while revenue in the light vehicle IAM in France and the French light vehicle distribution core
aftermarket grew more slowly (1.7% and 1.2%, respectively). We also outperformed the French B2B distribution
market in terms of profitability, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13% in 2017, as compared with market
benchmarks for other B2B distributors at 7% to 9%.

Our superior brand awareness is evidence of our strong positioning in the IAMs in which we operate.
According to an independent third-party survey conducted in France in 2017, the “Autodistribution” brand
enjoyed the highest brand awareness among its light vehicle distributor peers in France, with 92% brand
awareness (including unprompted awareness of 74% and prompted awareness of 18%). The second ranking
player in France had only 37% brand awareness. The “Autodistribution” brand also had a net promoter score of
59% in 2017; the two second ranking players had net promoter scores of 31%. In 2017, we were also the leader
among truck spare parts distributors in France in terms of prompted awareness (47%), with 2.5 times higher
awareness than the number two player and had the highest net promoter score, with 75% of positive answers.

We are also poised to benefit from key megatrends in the automotive industry. These megatrends consist of
increasing technical complexity and parts pricing and the increasing popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles
and of mobility and connectivity services. We forecast that 1.4% of addressable cars will be electric by 2025 and
that up to 80% of the aftermarket revenue in spare parts for those cars will be addressable by light vehicle IAM
distributors such as us. We have demonstrated our ability to continuously ramp up our products and services
offering to serve increasingly complex, computerized cars by proactively investing in technical support systems,
state-of-the-art garage technology, technician training and diagnostic tools that are adapted to electric and hybrid
cars.

We are also well positioned to address “mobility” shifts, in particular with our customers involved in fleet
management, through which public fleets will play a greater role. With our state-of-the-art logistics platforms
and extensive range of value-added customer service solutions, we are well positioned to meet the needs of fleet

operators who look to external supply and fleet management on a large scale. For example, we have partnered
with Oocar, which provides connected platforms, and we offer Auto Connect units for installation in vehicles,
which are box units that collect data using proprietary algorithms and allow drivers and technicians to track a
vehicle’s systems performance remotely and provide additional services, in real time, through connected devices.

**_Operational excellence based on a fully-integrated multi-channel distribution model with full control over the_**
**_value chain, offering superior product availability and best-in-class delivery times_**

We offer best-in-class product selection, availability and delivery times, giving us a significant advantage
over our competitors. We focus on delivering “the right product to the right place at the right time” relying on
our fully-integrated, multi-channel distribution model which is grounded in our extensive distribution network.

We are fully integrated, allowing us to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and
distribution, to end-customers. We are strongly and uniquely positioned as a central distribution intermediary for
all value chain levels, acting as an important link between parts suppliers and customers. We have built longterm relationships and enjoy significant purchasing power with a strategically concentrated group of suppliers,
resulting in excellent purchasing conditions for our CPUs. Through this supplier concentration strategy, we have
rationalized our supplier relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260
in 2018, allowing us to negotiate better terms with this smaller group of suppliers. For example, between 2014
and 2017, we reduced the number of suppliers of our brake product (the largest product family that we distribute)
from four to two. Over the 2014 to 2017 period, purchase volumes with brake product suppliers increased by
52%, growing from €21 million to €32 million, while our fees increased by 61%, growing from €10 million to
€16 million. Our offering is also multi-channel, with distribution carried out by a variety of wholly-owned
distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who distribute our products to a variety of
customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail locations and online players. Since the
acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we also benefit from a direct access to end-customers through online
sales of new spare parts from manufacturers and wholesalers. Oscaro offers approximately one million SKUs
across the spare parts universe.

We then use our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and our extensive distribution network to deliver our
products with best-in-class delivery times to more than 70,000 regular professional customers. Our distribution
network is key to our ability to deliver superior product availability and delivery times and we have built a
distribution network that gives us strong coverage and capacity. In France in 2017, we operated the largest
independent, single-branded light vehicle spare parts distribution network and the largest truck spare parts
distribution and service network, with approximately 445 distribution and repair locations overall as of
December 31, 2017.

Our distribution model helps us lower our costs and allows us to stock an extensive range of products with
favorable prices and volumes from our suppliers. This approach also leads to high customer loyalty and gain
market share. On one hand, through our highly efficient logistics platforms and ability to designate single
delivery points, suppliers benefit from cost-efficient access to a highly fragmented customer base which they
would otherwise struggle to address themselves. On the other hand, customers benefit from having access to a
product portfolio that reflects the full range of suppliers and products at competitive prices and from best-in-class
delivery times.

**_A performing operational model supported by an extensive and diversified product and value-added services_**
**_offering_**

We combine our powerful purchasing, logistical and distribution model with an extensive product and
value-added services offering that is tailored to directly address supplier and customer needs then by helping us
promote our brands, strengthen our relationships with suppliers and build customer loyalty. We believe that our
operational model reduces risk due to our broad product and value-added services offering and our multi-channel
approach that provides diversified exposure to a broad and fragmented customer base.

We offer value-added services to our suppliers, including marketing tools, market intelligence, invoicing
and back-office support and online tools. The value-added services that we offer to suppliers generate fees from
those suppliers and the value-added services that we offer to customers increase their loyalty to us, in both cases
providing an additional source of business that complements our product offering. We pursue a multi-channel
approach, distributing products to wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale
distributors who in turn sell to AD-branded garages, independent garages and retail locations. In addition, the
acquisition of Oscaro enabled us to further diversify our business model by developing our online distribution

channel. This approach allows us to address a large, diverse and fragmented customer base, protecting us from
customer concentration and giving us broad access to our addressable market.

We also offer our customers a wide range of value-added services, such as commercial support, training and
technical support, integrated branding, business leads with third-party providers and online tools. As a result of
our combined product and services offering we are a “one-stop” shop to our customers, and we believe this
increases customer loyalty to us. Additionally, unlike many of our competitors, our product range is not limited
to certain OEM or original equipment suppliers (“OES”) parts or to certain types of products. Our product
offering covers approximately 600,000 SKUs across the spare parts universe, including repair and maintenance
parts, body parts, repairer equipment, oil, tires, consumables and accessories. We also offer customers our private
label ISOTECH and Requal product offerings.

In addition, we have several affiliated garage networks, such as AD Expert, AD Carrosserie, Mondial PareBrise, 1, 2, 3 Garages and Auto Primo, which help us diversify our offering. We are able to combine the
significant advantage of having a well-known and trusted core brand with the ability to use affiliated garage
networks to target specific markets. One example of this is the Mondial Pare-Brise brand, which we acquired in
2017. Mondial Pare-Brise is an auto glass repair network that includes 220 franchised windscreen workshops and
70 wholly-owned workshops in France as of December 31, 2017. We have continued to operate Mondial PareBrise under its existing name because the brand is well-known in the French auto glass repair market, which is
complementary to our other offerings. Another example is the Auto Primo brand, which we operate to address
rural and semi-rural repair shops in France. Furthermore, we intend to follow the same approach with Oscaro and
to continue to operate Oscaro under the Oscaro brand.

**_Comprehensive approach to digital solutions_**

Our approach to capturing the advantages created by an increasingly digitalized ecosystem stretches across
every level of our business and we use digital tools to bolster our value-added services offering to suppliers and
customers, expand our product and services offering, address a growing online customer base and digitize our
operational model. The graphic below shows the comprehensive approach we have taken for integrating digital
solutions across our business, before the acquisition of Oscaro.

A number of our services to suppliers and customers are digital or online services, including our B2B online
order portals, such as Autossimo, Truckissimo and Salto, and our e-book, online training offerings (through Grup
Eina) and multi-brand online diagnostic tool (Diag’issimo). Our B2B car repair and maintenance portals increase
the integration of our business with our technical support capacities, helping us increase customer loyalty. We
also offer online tools for our customers’ clientele, such as the ID Garages online portal, which allows drivers to
schedule maintenance appointments, compare prices and receive quotes for work to be performed on their
vehicles. These services and tools enable us to expand our customers’ business.

In addition, we are also poised to capture opportunities in emerging digital product trends, such as
connected devices. One example is our partnership with Oocar, which provides connected platforms for vehicles.
We also plan to offer Auto Connect units for installation in vehicles, which will allow drivers and technicians to
track a vehicle’s systems performance remotely in real time through connected devices, and to use connected
devices to collect and compile data to continue serving drivers.

-----

We are also positioned to benefit from the increasing importance of the digital marketplace, which is the
fastest growing independent aftermarket distribution channel with an estimated 18% average annual growth rate
between 2010 and 2017. Web dealers are already part of our customer base, accounting for €101 million in
revenue in 2017. We have made deep and long-standing investments in our online customers to better serve this
growing channel, offering dedicated platforms, such as Doyen Auto and ACR. Following the acquisition of
Oscaro, the leader in online sales of light vehicle spare parts in France, we have become a truly “omni-channel”
distributor in France, benefiting from an increasing online presence through Oscaro’s approximately 2.5 million
customers and approximately €325 million of sales for the year ending December 31, 2017.

**_Demonstrated ability to deliver organic growth supported by a prudent and synergistic acquisition strategy_**

With over 55 years of experience in our industry, we have built the relationships, infrastructure and
know-how that we believe are critical to success in the Western European light vehicle and truck IAMs. This is
reflected in our strong organic growth. Our revenue grew from €914 million in the year ended December 31,
2014, to €1.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017, representing average organic growth of
approximately 3% per annum over the 2014 to 2017 period. Over the same period, profitability also grew. In the
year ended December 31, 2014, Adjusted EBITDA was €67 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.3%. In
the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA increased to €118 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin
was 9.4%. We benefit from a number of growth-compounding and profitability levers that we believe will
continue to help us improve our EBITDA. Our growth-compounding levers include our continued organic
growth and expansion in Western Europe.

Our organic growth has been supported by various factors, such as our new distribution model (which has
bolstered our offering to customers, thus leading to market share gains), our exposure to fast-growing channels
(such as web dealers), our successful recruiting of new branded garages, the development of our private-label
offers, improved purchasing conditions obtained through our supplier concentration strategy and our network
optimization strategy which is focused on cost-control. In recent years we have demonstrated stable organic
growth overall, particularly in the resilient light vehicle IAM, as a result of good purchasing conditions with
suppliers, network rationalization, recruitment of approximately 100 AD branded garages (net) per year from
2010 to 2017 with a churn rate of less than 5% and the disposal of non-core assets. Our model is based in part on
the delivery of value-added services to both suppliers and customers. These value-added services not only
generate fees from suppliers but also promote loyalty from customers, helping us grow our market share.

In addition, we have a strong track record of pursuing value-enhancing acquisitions and successfully
realizing synergies with such targets. In the past seven years, we have made thirteen sizeable acquisitions
(including Verviers Freins and Oscaro). We acquired approximately €700 million in revenue through acquisitions
since 2012 (of which Gobillot Rhône accounted for approximately €70 million in revenues, Rougon Queyrel and
FPLS collectively accounted for approximately €45 million, ACR accounted for approximately €100 million,
Doyen Auto and Automax collectively accounted for approximately €200 million, the 2017 acquisitions of ADB,
OVAM, Top Car, Ricauto and Mondial Pare-Brise collectively accounted for approximately €160 million and the
2018 acquisitions of Geevers and G-Group collectively accounted for an annualized revenue of approximately
€125 million), without taking into account the recent acquisitions of Verviers Freins and Oscaro.

Each of these acquisitions has been supported by a strategy centered on four pillars: consolidating our
leadership in countries where we are present (the 2013 acquisition of FPLS), expanding into new countries (the
2016 acquisition of Doyen Auto, the 2017 acquisition of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car in Italy and the 2018
acquisitions of Geevers (Benelux), G-Group (Italy) and Verviers Freins (Benelux)), acquiring complementary
businesses to enrich our value proposition (the 2017 acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise, a French auto glass repair
network) and expanding our digital exposure (the 2014 acquisition of ACR, the 2016 acquisition of Doyen Auto
and the 2018 acquisition of Oscaro).

In recent acquisitions, we have focused closely on seeking revenue synergies (rolling out our value
proposition fundamentals such as our private label product offerings, garage concept and customer services),
margin synergies (leveraging price and volume effects and supply chain cross-fertilization) and costs synergies
(rationalizing central and support function costs), putting particular emphasis on targets with highly identifiable
synergies. Our acquisitions have demonstrated favorable pre- and post-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiples
(calculated as enterprise value divided by EBITDA):

   - _ACR: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as compared with post-synergy_
multiple of approximately 3.5x, reflecting approximately €10 million in run-rate purchasing synergies;


7


-----

   - _Doyen-Auto: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 12x, as compared with post-_
synergy multiple of approximately 5x, reflecting approximately €12 million in run-rate purchasing
synergies;

   - _Mondial Pare-Brise: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 9x, as compared with_
post-synergy multiple of approximately 6x, reflecting approximately €1 million in run-rate purchasing
synergies; and

   - _OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as_
compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 5x, reflecting approximately €7 million in
run-rate purchasing synergies.

In addition, our acquisitions completed in 2018 have demonstrated EBITDA post-synergy multiples
between 4x and 7x.

Our acquisitions have also demonstrated our ability to grow revenue and EBITDA following an acquisition.
For example, following our acquisition of ACR in 2014, at which point our revenue was approximately
€75 million and our EBITDA was approximately €6 million, ACR benefited from more than €4 million in
organic growth and more than €10 million in synergies were realized, leading to revenue of approximately
€117 million and EBITDA of approximately €20 million in 2017. Similarly, following our acquisition of Doyen
Auto in 2015, at which point our revenue was approximately €190 million and our EBITDA was approximately
€7 million, Doyen Auto benefited from more than €1 million in organic growth and more than €12 million in
synergies were realized, leading to revenue of approximately €197 million and EBITDA of approximately
€20 million in 2017.

Our profitability drivers include our favorable purchasing conditions, integrated logistics model and the
ongoing optimization of our network. Our long-term relationships and significant purchasing power have enabled
us to negotiate favorable purchasing conditions with our suppliers, improving our margin on the products we
purchase, while our integrated logistics model has helped us reduce costs and increase margins. Likewise, our
efforts in recent years to rationalize and optimize our distribution network has helped us not only improve lead
times and customer service but also to reduce costs and increase margins.

**_A strong financial profile delivering an attractive combination of resilient growth, margin improvement, low_**
**_capital expenditure and high cash conversion_**

Since 2014, we have grown our revenue from €914 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to
€969 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, €1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016, and
€1.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017. This reflects a CAGR of 11.1% between the years ended
December 31, 2014, and 2017, with growth at 5.9%, 5.4% and 23.1% in the years ended December 31, 2015,
2016 and 2017, respectively, of which average organic growth was approximately 3% per annum over the 2014
to 2017 period and accounted for 3.5%, 2.8% and 2.1% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively.

We increased our Adjusted EBITDA from €67 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to €83 million,
€93 million and €118 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, representing
Adjusted EBITDA growth of 24.6%, 11.4% and 27.4% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2017, which illustrates the effects
that acquisitions would have had if such acquisitions had taken effect on January 1, 2017 and excluding certain
items recorded in 2017 that we consider as being not reflective of our ongoing operating performance, was
€131.0 million. We increased our Adjusted EBITDA margin from 7.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to
8.6%, 9.1% and 9.4% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

We operate a business model that requires a relatively low capital expenditure, using rented facilities
without needing to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the year ended December 31, 2017,
our capital expenditures amounted to 2.1% of our revenue (excluding Logisteo) and consisted of maintenance
expenditures for our distribution facilities and upgrades to our sales and warehouse IT management systems. Our
low level of capital expenditures has been stable in recent years, with capital expenditure for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, at 2.0%, 2.3% and 2.1% of revenue, respectively (in each case excluding
Logisteo). Our low levels of maintenance capital expenditure requirements have allowed us to invest in our
business in order to maintain our leading market positions and improve operating efficiency, as well as achieve
deleveraging through EBITDA growth and cash generation.

-----

Our cash conversion rate (which is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, net of Adjusted capital expenditure,
divided by Adjusted EBITDA) was 78% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, as compared with
73%, 76% and 78% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. This growth has been
supported by the implementation of a series of profit enhancing measures, including the continual negotiation of
good purchasing conditions with suppliers, network rationalization, the disposal of non-core assets and
realization of acquisition synergies.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsor_**

We operate under the stewardship of an experienced and successful management team with a proven track
record in European B2B distribution and international expansion, coupled with a supportive sponsor. Our CEO,
Mr. Stéphane Antiglio, and CFO, Mr. Christophe Gouthière, have a proven track record in developing and
implementing turnaround and growth strategies. Mr. Stéphane Antiglio is the former CEO of Pomona Passion
Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Mr. Christophe Gouthière was previously European CFO
of the Dole Group, a leading distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our CEO and CFO are supported by an
experienced management team and, together, they have successfully implemented profit improvement initiatives
and integrated thirteen new businesses into the Group in the last seven years. For example, our management team
successfully integrated ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in 2016, realizing higher purchasing and cost savings and
revenue enhancements than those identified at the time ACR and Doyen Auto were acquired. Our management
team has also delivered consistent organic growth while expanding margins, rolling out the implementation of
Logisteo and pursuing successful expansion into new geographies, products and channels. We believe that the
success of our management team in completing our profit improvement plan and returning our business to
profitable growth since 2010 has laid a solid foundation for further growth and increased profitability. The
support, investment experience and sector expertise of our sponsor, Bain Capital, supplement the leadership and
expertise of our management team.

**Our strategy**

Our strategy is to continue growing organically by leveraging our history of operational excellence that
focuses on offering a superior supplier and customer experience, to become the key consolidator in the
fragmented markets in which we operate by using our proven approach to M&A and to develop our online
segment and our position as a fully multi-channel player.

In terms of organic growth, we intend to grow revenues and continue to outperform the markets in which we
operate by continuing to apply and enhance our operational model based on a fully-integrated supply chain and
the distinctive suite of value-added digital and commercial services that we offer to our customers and suppliers.
We are in the process of optimizing this model and have a clear vision for ongoing improvements that are
designed to adapt our business to our evolving markets. In particular, we intend to capitalize on our value-added
services in order to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, increase customer loyalty and gain market
share.

In terms of M&A-led growth, we are focused on improving Adjusted EBITDA in terms of absolute value as
well as in terms of Adjusted EBITDA margin. In order to do this, we will put increasing focus on executing
value-accretive M&A transactions and successfully and efficiently integrating acquired businesses into the
Group.

In terms of our multi-channel approach, we intend to leverage the acquisition of Oscaro to continue to grow
our online product offering in France and in other markets and to strengthen our position in the B2C (DIY)
segment.

**_Continue integrating our upstream supply chain to solidify our market-leading position and expand margins_**

We operate a fully-integrated supply chain that connects our strategically concentrated group of suppliers to
our CPUs and state-of-the-art logistics platforms, through to an extensive distribution network that serves more
than 70,000 customers with deliveries several times per day and with best-in-class delivery times. We intend to
build on our history of operational excellence by continuing to integrate and rationalize our supply chain. We
believe this approach will help us maintain and further enhance our strong and unique positioning as a central
distribution intermediary for all value chain levels and to reinforce our role as an important link between parts
suppliers and customers. Based on the value that we have extracted from operational improvements in recent
years, we believe that continual improvements to our supply chain will contribute to increased market share and
expanded margins.


9


-----

We believe that our supply chain is key to our success because it helps us offer unique advantages to our
suppliers. For example, our increasing use of centralized, automated platforms simplifies suppliers own delivery
processes by offering a single delivery point. We believe that this single delivery point approach is a significant
and attractive advantage for our suppliers. We also offer suppliers a range of innovative value-added services
such as marketing tools and intelligence, online support tools, payment guarantees and a centralized invoicing
system with simplified back office support, all of which help suppliers grow their own business while creating
greater efficiencies through simplified tracking, delivery, monitoring and payment solutions. We believe that
these services represent advantages that are a “win-win” proposition for us and our suppliers, differentiating us
from our competitors.

In addition, we are pursuing increased integration of our supply chain, which is based on two flows of spare
parts: a “direct delivery flow” from suppliers to distributors and a “platform-based flow” through our logistics
platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2017, 62% of our products were distributed via our platform-based
flow, as compared with 18% in 2010, representing a marked improvement that we intend to pursue by further
developing our platform-based flow. This approach is expected to drive improved product availability and
delivery times while generating favorable financial conditions for us, due in part to the higher logistics fees
which we can apply in this context, and which we expect will lead to higher margins, as the logistics fees
received from suppliers generally exceed the related costs of operating the logistics platforms. This is particularly
applicable to our new, automated platforms, such as Logisteo, because these platforms generally offer a doubled
capacity for SKU stockage as well as doubled processing capacity, allowing us to offer more SKUs from a wider
range of product lines and suppliers. We will pursue this strategy by encouraging new suppliers to make
deliveries through the platform flow from the outset as well as by having existing supplies expand the breadth of
their range offered through our platform-based flow.

**_Continue concentrating supplier relationships in order to optimize purchasing conditions with key suppliers_**
**_and expanding our private label offerings, to increase profitable growth_**

We are currently implementing a supplier concentration strategy by which we have rationalized our supplier
relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260 in 2018. This approach
has allowed us to further improve our negotiating leverage with suppliers, driving more favorable purchasing
terms and increased volumes, while maintaining a sufficient number of suppliers to avoid undue reliance on
particular suppliers. Additionally, we are often a key client of our major suppliers, further increasing our
negotiating leverage.

This approach has already enabled us to concentrate a significant number of our purchasing relationships but
there remain certain product families and products that we continue to source from multiple suppliers. As a
result, we see further opportunities to concentrate our supply flows and plan to select no more than two or three
suppliers per product or sub-category of product in the near future. We expect that this strategy will continue to
enhance purchasing conditions for us, which in turn will improve product availability and profitability.

In addition, we intend to continue expanding our private label offerings, such as ISOTECH and Requal, in
both new geographies as well as the countries in which we already operate. We benefit from more attractive
margins on ISOTECH products as compared with third-party branded products. As a result, our expansion
strategy for our private label offerings is expected to optimize production costs, while increasing volumes sold
per SKU and allowing us to negotiate improved purchasing conditions with the suppliers of these products, in
turn leading to profitable growth through margin expansion.

**_Build on improved distribution models in both light vehicle and trucks to continue growing market share_**

In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution models for our Light Vehicle
France and Trucks segments, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic
investments in our automated logistics platforms. Through this strategy, we aim to improve operational
efficiency, enhance customer service, cover multiple regions with the use of small pivot sites, rationalize flows
and optimize inventory and warehousing, reflecting a focus on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the
regional level, while maintaining excellent delivery times.

For example, since 2014, we have redesigned and refined our Light Vehicle France distribution model,
moving from a large number of delivery sites acting as intermediaries between suppliers and our logistics
platforms and garage customers, to a more precisely deployed network of pivot sites that connects suppliers and
our logistics platforms with proximity and delivery sites, which are strategically located to address customer
demand. A key component of this strategy is our ongoing efforts to grow our affiliated network of garages. We


10


-----

expect that our new model will improve distributor performance with optimized inventory levels and SKU
availability and an increased ability to adapt our offer to local customer requirements, leading to an enhanced
customer experience. We continue to seek ways to optimize our operation and believe that in the current, second
phase of this operational re-design, which will be focused on fine-tuning the light vehicle distribution model, we
can further improve delivery times, quality of service and availability of products, each of which are expected to
help us gain greater market share in the geographies where we operate.

In our Trucks segment, we are also focused on operational improvement and have begun implementing a
new distribution model, which is expected to be fully rolled out by mid-2019. The new distribution model for the
Trucks segment aims to grow our network of affiliated garages and to reconfigure our current network of 130
distribution sites to be organized around 12 regional warehouses focused on distribution to local sites, owned and
independent garages and integrated workshops. We believe that our new distribution model for our Trucks
segment will lead to better availability of our wide range of SKUs, allowing us to better utilize our large network
and unique range of value-added services to meet customer demand. For example, with our new Trucks
distribution model, we believe we will be the only player in the French truck spare parts market able to serve our
full range of customers with twice daily deliveries made within four hours.

**_Expand our value-added services offering to customers, further differentiating the customer experience and_**
**_driving customer loyalty_**

We have developed an innovative and unique suite of value-added services for our customers, including
best-in-class delivery times, commercial support, training and technical support, a strong commercial concept
with integrated branding, business leads to key third-party providers and a wide variety of online and digital
tools. We believe that the variety and quality of the value-added services that we offer to customers increase
customer loyalty in part because such services help embed us within their customers operations, making us a key
partner in our customers’ success. In addition, this varied suite of value-added services also enable us to serve a
wide and diverse customer base with a wide range of evolving needs and demands.

Our digital services are a key factor that differentiate us from our competitors. We intend to continue
growing our digital offering in order to capitalize on this competitive advantage. For example, in November
2018, we acquired Oscaro, the leading online seller of light vehicle spare parts in France. This strategic
acquisition strengthened our online distribution channel and allowed us to become an “omni-channel”
aftermarket spare parts distributor in France.

In addition, we have developed proprietary B2B online tools to support our customers with state-of-the-art
online ordering capabilities, such as our proprietary online portals, Autossimo and Truckissimo. Our online
ordering portals improve our customers’ experience by offering a user-friendly portal for garages to search
through a large selection of spare parts, directly order parts online and obtain technical information about those
parts. In 2017, one-third of French garages were Autossimo customers, demonstrating the wide appeal of these
portals. Our online tools enhance integration, increasing customer loyalty and wallet share while reducing call
center and other related costs. We have also created ID Garages to increase visibility of our branded garages. ID
Garages is a website that allows customers to locate and compare garages and schedule service appointments
online. It is a “win-win” solution for us, as we retain a percentage of the fee quote, and for our garage customers,
who collect fees from business gained through the portal. We estimate that ID Garages has generated
approximately €700,000 in subscriptions and fees for us and generated approximately €4.2 million of revenue for
our garage customers in the year ended December 31, 2017.

We aim to constantly innovate by offering new and improved services and tools and using existing tools to
create future growth. For example, we intend to expand our ID Garages offering into Benelux and Italy, with the
goal of doubling the number of subscribers, increasing revenues derived from this service and becoming a key
reference in online bookings. We also intend to extend our partnerships with third parties such as insurers and
fleets and to expand our innovative AD Connect offering. In addition, we have started to reinforce our
partnership with Grup Eina, a strong technical platform that offers customers valuable training opportunities.

**_Continue optimizing our distribution network_**

We believe that our extensive distribution network is important to our present and continued success. In
order to preserve and expand this advantage profitably, we employ a cost-conscious approach to managing our
distribution network, constantly focusing on improving network efficiency and breadth of coverage, while
minimizing or eliminating redundancies wherever possible. For example, in our light vehicle business, we are
currently focused on ongoing upgrades to our real estate parc and improvements to the size and coverage of our


11


-----

footprint of distribution sites in France. When and where necessary, we remodel, close or consolidate sites. We
also work to lower and rationalize downstream logistics costs by maximizing the square footage of our sites and
by modernizing our logistics and monitoring functions, such as through the increased use of bar coding and the
creation of a dedicated logistics department. In our Trucks business, we are implementing an improvement plan
that is focused on closing low- and non-performing sites in the context of a broader profit-focused effort to
optimize our distribution network.

**_Continue to grow our footprint with entries into neighboring countries and expansion in existing countries_**

In recent years, we have implemented a number of successful acquisitions, demonstrating the strength and
rigor of our prudent M&A process. This M&A process is centered around careful evaluation of potential targets,
which are usually selected from local leaders that offer significant purchasing synergies. Through strategic
acquisitions, we have penetrated new geographies, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Doyen Auto, which
allowed us to expand into Benelux, as well as broaden our reach or product offering in the countries in which we
already operate, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise, which allowed us to offer a full range
of windscreen replacement products in France. In addition, through the acquisition of Oscaro in France, we have
penetrated the B2C (DIY) segment and strengthened our position in the e-commerce market. We have started to
implement the following initiatives to bring back Oscaro’s sales and profitability to normalized levels: (i) put in
place an interim management team with full control on the operations of the business, who have already started
to deliver our profitability improvement plan for Oscaro, (ii) the payment of supplier overdues and client refunds,
which we aim to finalize during the first quarter of 2019, (iii) various cost-saving measures, including the
carve-out of non-core activities, change of service provider and renegotiation of transportation costs, as well as
some pre-identified savings on consulting fees and the rationalization of international activities, (iv) negotiations
with suppliers in order to optimize purchasing terms and conditions, which we aim to finalize during the first half
of 2019 and (v) sales improvement through customers reimbursements to improve customer satisfaction,
ensuring that the full assortment of spare parts is available, online and offline marketing strategy and branding
campaigns.

We intend to continue making strategic, value-accretive acquisitions in the near term as well as in the
medium term, including in certain geographies adjacent to the countries in which we operate. We intend to focus
on new geographies where the car parcs are similar enough to those in which we are already active to realize
synergies and where we can effectively use our logistics platforms and distribution networks. We also intend to
consolidate our leadership in the countries where we are already present, building on areas of strength and taking
advantage of the fragmented nature of these markets. We also have set a goal of continuing to grow our market
share in France, maintaining and strengthening our leading position in both the light vehicle and truck IAMs.

**_Maintain a positive social environment to recruit and retain talent by focusing on development opportunities_**

We believe that attracting and retaining talented people is critical to our success and believe that the key to
attracting and retaining talented employees is offering development and growth opportunities in the context of a
positive social environment. We intend to maintain our strong corporate culture with a human resources strategy
that focuses on creating and sustaining an experienced, motivated and stable workforce. In order to do this, our
human resources strategy is, and will continue to be, organized around four pillars: (i) successful talent
recruitment, supported by marketing events, educational collaborations and digital initiatives, (ii) development of
employees through training partnerships, e-learning and talent appraisal and evaluation processes, (iii) a costefficient approach to benefits through payroll monitoring, unified compensation policies and favorable social
protection schemes and (iv) the development of a positive social environment through continuous improvement
of working conditions, investments in work spaces and workforce rationalization.

_proceeds.”_

**Recent developments**

**_Acquisition of Verviers Freins_**

On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Verviers Freins by our subsidiary Doyen Auto.
Verviers Freins is a Belgian multi-brand distributor of mechanical parts, bodywork, paint, tools and garage
equipment and was established in 1967. Verviers Freins operates in the Liège region and in eastern Belgium and
employs approximately 100 people in eight sale outlets.

**_Acquisition of Oscaro_**

In July 2018, we acquired a 4.95% ownership stake in Oscaro for consideration of €10 million. On
November 13, 2018, we increased our total ownership stake in Oscaro to 82.49% for incremental consideration
of approximately €80 million, which included a capital investment of approximately €55 million in Oscaro. We
financed the acquisition of Oscaro with drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Indenoï, the holding
company of Oscaro’s founder Pierre-Noël Luiggi, will retain a share of up to approximately 17.5% in Oscaro.
Mr. Luiggi will not continue to hold any operational role in the company.

Oscaro is an independent online distributor of light vehicle spare parts and was established in 2001. It is the
leader in online sales of light vehicle spare parts in France, which is the fastest growing independent aftermarket
distribution channel, and has an online market share of approximately 50% in France based on online sales.
Oscaro’s e-commerce platform allows car owners to buy automotive parts online from a range of manufacturers,
without going through automotive dealers. Oscaro’s product offering includes new spare parts from
manufacturers and wholesalers which include Bosch, Continental, Contiteck, Luk, SKF, TRW and Valeo, and we
have been one of the key spare parts suppliers of Oscaro. Oscaro generates revenue primarily from its B2C (DIY)
segment and operates mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in other markets such as Spain. Oscaro served
approximately 2.5 million customers in 2017, received approximately 345,000 orders a month and had a portfolio
of approximately 1 million SKUs.


13


-----

Oscaro generated revenue of approximately €325 million and a negative EBITDA of approximately
€18 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, with a gross margin of approximately 30%. As of
September 30, 2018, Oscaro had €12.0 million of third-party borrowings outstanding under bilateral facilities and
finance leases, which we acquired in connection with the acquisition.

Since the completion of the acquisition, we have started to implement the following initiatives to bring back
Oscaro’s sales and profitability to normalized levels: (i) put in place an interim management team with full
control on the operations of the business, who have already started to deliver our profitability improvement plan
for Oscaro, (ii) the payment of supplier overdues and client refunds, which we aim to finalize during the first
quarter of 2019, (iii) various cost-saving measures, including the carve-out of non-core activities, change of
service provider and renegotiation of transportation costs, as well as some pre-identified savings on consulting
fees and the rationalization of international activities, (iv) negotiations with suppliers in order to optimize
purchasing terms and conditions, which we aim to finalize during the first half of 2019 and (v) sales
improvement through customers reimbursements to improve customer satisfaction, ensuring that the full
assortment of spare parts is available, online and offline marketing strategy and branding campaigns. We expect
to realize approximately €15 million of cost savings from optimization measures, including the rationalization of
non-core entities, and approximately €15 million purchasing synergies, resulting from Oscaro purchasing spare
parts under our existing arrangements with suppliers, which provide for better commercial terms. These savings
initiatives are expected to be implemented over the next 14 to 18 months and the implementation is expected to
cost approximately €10 million.

**_Change of Name_**

On November 22, 2018, the Issuer (formerly Autodis S.A.) announced that it changed its name to Parts
Europe S.A.

**_Bridge Facility Agreement_**

On January 2, 2019, we entered into a Bridge Facility Agreement among, inter alios, the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor, BNP Paribas S.A. and Goldman Sachs International as arrangers and Elavon Financial
Services DAC, UK Branch, as agent (the “Bridge Facility Agreement”). We have an aggregate principal amount
of €90.0 million available for borrowing under the Bridge Facility Agreement on a committed basis to refinance
amounts drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility. The Bridge Facility Agreement may, subject to the
satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized until April 15, 2019. We expect the Bridge Facility
Agreement to be undrawn on the Issue Date. The Bridge Facility Agreement will terminate on or around the
Issue Date.

**_Current trading_**

Based on the preliminary draft of our internal management accounts, we currently expect our revenues to
increase by 15% to approximately €1,329 million for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018, of which
organic growth represents approximately 4% compared to the eleven months ended November 30, 2017. We also
expect our Adjusted EBITDA to increase by 14% to approximately €128 million for the eleven months ended
November 30, 2018 (without taking into account the acquisition of Oscaro), of which organic growth represents
approximately 5% compared to the eleven months ended November 30, 2017. We estimate that our cash
conversion rate was approximately 78% for the eleven months ended November 30, 2018. Our change in
working capital for that period resulted in a cash outflow of approximately €27 million and our capital
expenditures amounted to approximately €28 million. As of November 30, 2018, we had cash and cash
equivalents of approximately €85 million.

beneficially own 100% of the share capital of LuxCo 5, LuxCo 6, the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer indirectly through
wholly-owned or majority-owned intermediate holding companies. Percentages refer to the percentage ownership of equity and
equity-like instruments. See “Principal shareholders.”

(2) On the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering: (i) to fund the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes
Redemption; (ii) to repay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility; (iii) for general corporate purposes; and (iv) to
pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing. See “Use of proceeds” and “—The Refinancing.”

(3) On November 14, 2016, the Issuer issued €260.0 million of Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes and €260.0 million of
Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On April 21, 2017, and July 11,
2018, the Issuer issued €80.0 million and €175.0 million, respectively, of additional Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.


15


-----

Following the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Redemption on or about the Issue Date, €443.0 million of Existing
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will remain outstanding.

(4) The Senior Secured Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with any
existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the
obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if
any), will rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Senior Secured Notes and will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any), that are secured by
property and assets of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of such
property and assets.

As of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) by Parts Holding Europe S.A.S. (formerly
Autodis Group S.A.S.) (the “Parent Guarantor”) and Autodistribution S.A.S. (the “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the
Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”). As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, the Issuer and the Guarantors
(excluding equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 33.5% of the
consolidated total assets, 6.1% of the consolidated revenue and 33.3% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. The
Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will
also be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise reflect limitation under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantor is
expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the outstanding amount under certain proceeds loans, which is
currently €282 million and corresponds to the aggregate of the proceeds loan made available to on-lend the proceeds of prior
issuances of the Existing Senior Secured Notes to the Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be
similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial
_assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the validity_
_and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks_
_related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as_
_the case may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Senior Secured Notes, and may limit your ability to_
_enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and_
enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

As of the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by: (i) a first-priority pledge of the share capital
of LuxCo 6 held by LuxCo 5; (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, material bank accounts and material intragroup
receivables of the Parent Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis
shareholdings); (iv) first-priority security interests over certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution
S.A.S., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, its material bank accounts and its material intragroup
receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S.
and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A.S., (B) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material bank accounts and
(C) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material intragroup receivables. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” The
Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) (the “Super Senior Obligations”) are secured by first-priority
security interests over, among others, the Collateral, contractually ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Senior
Secured Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the security interests over the
Collateral, holders of Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the Super Senior Obligations have
been repaid. The security interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief
description of such limitations, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the security interests.”_

(5) The Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement provides for drawings of up to €90.0 million, all of which will be available for
borrowing following the completion of the Refinancing. Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by
security interests over, among other things, the Collateral. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an
enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the
Collateral only after lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, creditors of any future indebtedness that is permitted
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu on the enforcement of the Collateral
with the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to future hedging arrangements (if any) have been
repaid in full. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the
repayment of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and
the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement (including the Existing Senior Secured Notes). The indebtedness of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement is guaranteed by, and is secured by certain assets of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee,
and do not provide security in favor of, the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

(6) Autodistribution S.A.S. and several of our other subsidiaries have entered into various factoring, working capital and bilateral
lending facilities with an aggregate principal amount of €47.0 million outstanding as of September 30, 2018, excluding bank
overdrafts and certain Italian local lines of credit. In addition, Verviers Freins and Oscaro had third-party borrowings of nil and


16


-----

€12.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2018. These factoring arrangements and the working capital and bilateral lending
facilities will remain in place after the Refinancing. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Other financing
_arrangements.”_

(7) Certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 66.5% of the consolidated total assets, 93.9% of the
consolidated revenue and 66.7% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. As of September 30, 2018, and after giving
pro forma effect to the Refinancing, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor had €89.7 million of debt outstanding
(excluding bank overdrafts). See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior
_Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.”_

                         - are general obligations of the Guarantors, secured as set forth
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security”;

                         - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future

                         - are structurally subordinated to any existing or future

As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, the Issuer
and the Guarantors (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for
33.5% of the consolidated total assets, 6.1% of the consolidated

Guarantor.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as
necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a
fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under
applicable law, or otherwise reflect limitations under applicable law.
By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the
Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantor is expected to be limited in
value to an amount not greater than the outstanding amount under
certain proceeds loans, which is currently €282 million and
corresponds to the aggregate of the proceeds loan made available to
on-lend the proceeds of prior issuances of the Existing Senior Secured
Notes to the Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the
Guarantors may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate_
_benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the_
_Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Senior_
_Secured Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk_
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured_
_Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and_
_Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be favorable to creditors,_
_including investors in the Senior Secured Notes, and may limit your_
_ability to enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the_
_Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The validity_
and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

-----

The Guarantees are also subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
recoveries in respect of the Guarantees is required to be applied to
repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility
and certain future indebtedness and hedging obligations permitted
under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with indebtedness under
the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Senior Secured Notes
and the Guarantees in respect of the Senior Secured Notes. See
“Description _of_ _certain_ _financing_ _arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.” The Guarantees will be subject to release under certain_
circumstances. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Notes
_Guarantees release.”_

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by: (i) a first-priority
pledge of the share capital of LuxCo 6 held by LuxCo 5; (ii) a firstpriority pledge of the capital stock, material bank accounts and
material intragroup receivables of the Parent Guarantor; (iii) a firstpriority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de
_minimis shareholdings); (iv) first-priority security interests over_
certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock of
Autodistribution S.A.S., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A.
held by the Issuer, its material bank accounts and its material
intragroup receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the
capital stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad
S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A.S.,
(B) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material bank accounts and
(C) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material intragroup receivables. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.”

The Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any)
(the “Super Senior Obligations”) are secured by first-priority security
interests over, among other things, the Collateral, contractually
ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Senior
Secured Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the
event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral,
holders of Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the
Collateral only after the Super Senior Obligations have been repaid.
The security interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to
recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law
and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable
law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first-priority security
interests securing the Senior Secured Notes are contractually deemed
to rank equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the
extent that such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) (i)
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain
obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain other future
indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (including to the extent such indebtedness shares in these
security interests, future subordinated notes). Such security interests
are, or will be, evidenced by security documents for the benefit of


20


-----

(whether directly or through the Security Agent) the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility
and/or the holders of certain other future senior or subordinated
indebtedness and obligations. Under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration
of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes, amounts
recovered in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, including from the
enforcement of the Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to
repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu
with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if
any) in priority to the Senior Secured Notes, following the payment of
fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and
any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future
senior or subordinated indebtedness permitted under the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture to benefit from such security
interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant security
unless instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement). The relevant Instructing Group or such
other class of creditors as specified by the Intercreditor Agreement
may, under certain conditions, be entitled to instruct the Security
Agent to enforce the relevant security subject to, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of
conflicting instructions, the Intercreditor Agreement contains
provisions as to which set of instructions will prevail. See
“Description _of_ _certain_ _financing_ _arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

**Optional redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured Notes at the
redemption prices set forth under “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Optional redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest and_
additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
redemption.

**Additional amounts; Tax**
**redemption** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in
part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, if, as a result of certain
changes in tax law the Issuer or Guarantor is or would be required to
pay additional amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. If
the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes plus interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of redemption. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes.”_

**Change of control** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If the Issuer experiences a change of control, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at 101% of their principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to, but not including, the date of such repurchase. A change of
control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a
consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is not exceeded in
connection with such event. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will
limit, among other things, the ability of the Parent Guarantor, the
Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer to:

                         - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                         - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                         - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                         - create or permit to exist certain security interests;

                         - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

                         - transfer, lease or sell certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

                         - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                         - amend certain documents; and

                         - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes.

Additionally, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the ability
of LuxCo 5, LuxCo 6, the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer to engage
in certain business and other activities.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain covenants,” and the related definitions._

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we
achieve investment-grade ratings and following a qualifying initial
public offering of the capital stock of any direct or indirect parent
entity of the Issuer. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain covenants—Suspension of covenants on achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status,” and “Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes—Certain covenants—Disapplication of covenants and release_
_of Liens on a Qualifying IPO.”_

**Use of proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering: (i) to fund the
Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Redemption; (ii) to
repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility;
(iii) for general corporate purposes; and (iv) to pay the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing. See “—The
_Refinancing” and “Use of proceeds.”_

**Transfer restrictions** . . . . . . . . . . . . The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will
not be, registered under U.S. federal or state or any foreign security
laws and are subject to restrictions on resales. See “Important
_information_ _about_ _this_ _Offering_ _Memorandum,”_ “Transfer
_restrictions” and “Plan of distribution.” We are under no obligation,_
and we do not intend, to register the Senior Secured Notes in the
United States under the U.S. Securities Act.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of
the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured
Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such
permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes will be granted or that
such listing will be maintained.

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

The following tables set forth our summary consolidated financial information and other data for the periods
ended and as of the dates indicated below. Our summary consolidated financial information as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, which are
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, have been audited by our auditors and their audit report is included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The summary consolidated financial information as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, included in this Offering Memorandum has been restated to give effect to
IFRS 15 and IFRS 5, unless otherwise indicated. See “Presentation of financial information and other data—
_Restatements.” The consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor included in this Offering_
Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. No financial information with respect to the Issuer is
included in this Offering Memorandum.

Our summary unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, has been derived from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which are included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The historical unaudited financial information for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting,” the
IFRS standard applicable to interim financial statements and contains all adjustments that management considers
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. The
summary unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, included in the Offering Memorandum has been derived from the comparative information
contained in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor as of
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting,”
the IFRS standard applicable to interim financial statements. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, have been
reviewed by our auditors and their review report is included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30,
2018, has been derived by adding the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2017, to the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018, and subtracting the consolidated financial information of the Parent
Guarantor for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The financial information for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our
results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. This information has not
been audited or reviewed by our auditors.

We have also presented summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and other data prepared to
give full-year effect to the acquisitions made during the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, and of the
acquisitions of Verviers Freins and Oscaro and related synergies and cost saving measures. See “Presentation of
_financial information and other data—Pro Forma Financial Information.” We cannot assure you that we will be_
able to realize all these purchasing and cost savings, and the costs we incur to realize these savings may be higher
than expected or may outweigh the benefits. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and
certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and
other data are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or
other financial information actually would have been if the aforementioned transactions had occurred on
October 1, 2017, or on any other date and such data do not purport to project the results of operations for any
future period.

the amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes increased by €1.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the
amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes decreased by €15.4 million. The amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes may be
significantly different from one month-end to another depending on whether month-end closing is a working or non-working day and on
whether suppliers cash-collect the promissory notes in due time or not.

** Revenue organic growth and Adjusted EBITDA organic growth between two periods (N and N-1) are determined as follows:

   - In respect of acquisitions made in period N, by deducting, from the period N revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively, generated in period N by such acquisitions;

   - In respect of acquisitions made in period N-1, by deducting from the period N and period N-1 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA,
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated in period N and N-1 by such acquisitions; and

   - In respect of disposals, by deducting, from the period N and N-1 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, the revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively, generated by disposals made in period N and in period N-1.

Revenue organic growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, excludes the impact of IFRS 15.

From time to time we acquire, sell or close individual sites or businesses as part of our ongoing network management. These transactions
are considered not material over the historical period and are deemed to be part of organic growth.

*** Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue and is calculated on a consolidated basis and by
segment.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income from ordinary activities of the Parent Guarantor before depreciation/amortization
expense (as included in our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017 and 2018), as adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain items we believe are non-recurring.
Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is a relevant measure for assessing performance and cash flows and thus aids
in understanding our profitability for a given period. For a description of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as a financial
measure, see “Presentation of financial information and other data—Other financial measures.”

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor after giving pro forma effect to the acquisitions
made during the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, and the acquisitions of Verviers Freins and Oscaro completed in
October and November 2018, respectively (see “—Recent developments”), and related synergies and cost saving measures. Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein differs from Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
governing the Senior Secured Notes. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize all these purchasing and cost savings, and
the costs we incur to realize these savings may be higher than expected or may outweigh the benefits. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our business—We may face challenges in integrating businesses that we have acquired or will acquire, and in expanding_
_into new markets and may be unable to realize the expected synergies and savings from these businesses or cost improvement_
_initiatives we have taken.”_

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only. This information does not purport to represent what our
results of operations or other financial information would have been had the acquisitions made during the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018, occurred on October 1, 2017, or on any other date. These numbers have not been audited and are not derived
from accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. For the limitations of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, see “Presentation of
_financial information and other data—Other financial measures.”_

(3) Change in working capital for a given period represents the change in inventories, trade payables, trade receivables and other receivables
and payables. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, increase/(decrease) in trade payables are adjusted to exclude the
effect of the change in the amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes over the relevant periods. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, the amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes increased by €1.1 million. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2018, the amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes decreased by €15.4 million. The amount of undrawn suppliers’
promissory notes may be significantly different from one month-end to another depending on whether month-end closing is a working or
non-working day and on whether suppliers cash-collect the promissory notes in due time or not.

(4) Capital expenditure consists solely of the acquisition of non-current assets. Adjusted capital expenditures excludes from capital
expenditure the one-off investments made in our new automated Logisteo platform. Adjusted capital expenditures does not take into
account the acquisition of Verviers Freins and Oscaro. It is calculated as follows:

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Senior Secured Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to considering_
_carefully, in light of the circumstances and your individual investment objectives, the information contained_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the risks described below before_
_investing in the Senior Secured Notes. If any of the events described below actually occurs, our business, results_
_of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected and, accordingly, the value and the_
_trading price of the Senior Secured Notes may decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of any investment in the_
_Senior Secured Notes. The order in which the risk factors are presented does not necessarily reflect the_
_likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude or significance of the individual risk factor. Furthermore, the_
_risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties_
_not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect_
_on our business, results of operations or financial condition._

_Unless otherwise indicated, the financial and operational data presented herein do not include Verviers_
_Freins and Oscaro._

**Risks related to our business**

**_Material disruptions to our supply chain or logistics platforms, in particular to our warehouses or_**
**_transportation network, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

As of December 31, 2017, our distribution network infrastructure in France was composed of our CPUs and
regional warehouses, connected to 34 wholly-owned distributors and 53 affiliated independent distributors
operating out of approximately 360 owned and affiliated distribution locations. Our light vehicle operations in
France are serviced by three logistics platforms: (i) Logisteo, our automated warehouse, (ii) ACR, focused on key
accounts and online customers and (iii) Cora, focused on light vehicle body parts for collision repair. Our light
vehicle operations in Benelux and Italy are serviced by four logistics platforms: Doyen Auto and Geevers which
cover Belgium and the Netherlands as well as certain online customers, and OVAM/Ricauto and G-Group which
cover Italy. Our trucks segment is serviced by one logistics platform called Bremstar. We rely on road
transportation for the prompt transfer of the products that we distribute from our warehouses or distribution sites
directly to our customers.

A material disruption at any one of our warehouses or distribution sites or to our logistics platform or
transportation network caused, for example, by fire, weather-related problems, employee strikes, lock-outs and
inadequacies in the transport infrastructure, or other events, could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a
timely manner or at all, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any damages that may arise or to
compensate us for any losses that we may incur, due to such interruption of our operations.

We also rely, directly and indirectly, upon independent third-party logistics providers to ship to us most of
our products from our suppliers and to transport products from our logistics platforms to our distribution
network. Our use of any logistics provider is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which could
increase our shipping and transportation costs. Strikes, work stoppages and inclement weather may impact such
logistics providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our needs. If we change our
arrangements with, or lose one of our important third-party logistics providers, we could face logistical
difficulties that could materially adversely affect our operations and could cause us to incur significant costs and
expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as
those received from the third-party logistics providers we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.

Since we distinguish ourselves on the basis of our superior delivery times (some of which are as short as a
few hours), any material disruption that lengthens delivery times to our customers could strain our relationships
with such customers and, as a result, may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and
reputation.

We are also exposed to an increase in transportation costs. In the year ended December 31, 2017,
transportation costs accounted for 4.4% of our revenue. Transportation costs have historically fluctuated
significantly over time, particularly in connection with oil prices, and increased transportation costs could result
in reduced profits. Any disruption in transportation services, or any increases in the cost of transportation, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and are dependent on the ability of our third-_**
**_party suppliers to meet our product requirements._**

We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute. In 2018, we relied on approximately 260
third-party suppliers for the provision of light vehicle and truck spare parts, equipment and tools that are essential
to our business. We are currently implementing a supplier concentration strategy by which we have rationalized
our supplier relationships, reducing the number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260 in 2018,
which allows us to negotiate with a smaller group of suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our top
ten suppliers accounted for 45% of our products purchases by volume (as compared with 35% in the year ended
December 31, 2010). Our top supplier accounted for 12% of our products by volume.

Our business and, ultimately, our results of operations are dependent on our suppliers’ ability to provide us
with products. Our suppliers may fail to meet delivery deadlines, provide us with sufficient products or comply
with our quality requirements. The capacity of some of our suppliers to meet our supply requirements may in the
future be constrained at various times and our suppliers may be susceptible to production difficulties, insufficient
quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs or other factors that
negatively affect the quantity or quality of their production.

Production by one or more suppliers could be disrupted due to a variety of factors, including closures of one
of our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages,
fires, explosions, terrorist attacks, financial distress or bankruptcy, as well as political upheaval, adverse
economic events or logistical complications, weather, natural disasters, mechanical failures, delayed customs
processing or other events. Any short-term or prolonged disruption in the supply of spare parts from our suppliers
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the event
that one or more of our major suppliers experiences operational or financial difficulties and we are unable to
secure alternative sources in a timely manner or on commercially beneficial terms, we may experience inventory
shortages which could result in unfilled customer orders and lost revenues due to our “just-in-time” delivery
method, as well as damage to our business reputation.

If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products under our presently agreed
terms, or if we are unable to obtain products from our suppliers in the future at favorable prices, our margins will
likely be negatively impacted and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. Moreover, if there is a significant or unexpected drop in customer demand or if there is a
significant increase in customer demand that we are unable to meet from our “on-hand” inventory stock or
procure in time from our suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

From time to time and in a limited number of cases, we have entered into agreements with, or provided
services to, certain suppliers that may not necessarily be formalized in writing or otherwise and may enter into
such agreements or provide such services in the future. In such circumstances, such suppliers could potentially
demand higher prices or more stringent payment terms or may break off the agreement with limited notice and
we may have no contractual remedy against such suppliers if we suffer economic loss as a result of their actions.
Our ability to ensure continuity of supply from such suppliers might also be limited.

**_Our business is exposed to risks associated with economic and other conditions in the global economy and in_**
**_particular in France, Benelux and Italy._**

The demand for certain of the products that we distribute may be impacted by the condition of the global
economy and in particular by economic conditions in France, Benelux and Italy. The light vehicle spare parts
aftermarket tends to be affected in the early period of a recession, when end-customers delay the maintenance of
their light vehicles. The truck spare parts aftermarket is more cyclical than the light vehicle spare parts
aftermarket, due to the correlation of the demand for road freight with general economic conditions.
Simultaneously, de-stocking occurs at all levels of the spare parts supply chain, which may cause short- to
medium-term decreases in sales by distributors of light vehicle and truck spare parts. France is our principal
geographic market, representing 68.1% of our revenue and 93.7% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2017. We also operate in Benelux and Italy and our Light Vehicle International segment
represented 19.3% of our revenue and 15.0% of our Adjusted EBITDA over the same period. Our truck segment
which operates in France represented 12.6% of our revenue and 1.4% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the same
period. Economic uncertainty in our main markets, especially France, and globally, could decrease consumer
confidence and consumer and business spending on vehicle maintenance, or less frequent visits by our customers
to our garages, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

32


-----

We cannot predict the timing or duration of any economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a
subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in the geographies in which we operate. If the light vehicle and
truck spare parts aftermarket significantly deteriorates due to economic conditions, we could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continued uncertainty in global economic
conditions (particularly in the Eurozone) also poses a risk to our existing contractual arrangements and the
fulfillment of obligations by us, our product suppliers or our customers. If the current economic situation
deteriorates significantly or if one or more Eurozone countries were to depart from the euro, our business could
be materially adversely impacted.

We are also subject to the risk of increased costs due to general economic conditions, both in forms of
increased employee costs and increased costs of operational costs. Any failure to pass such increases in costs on
to our customers could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, our business and financial results may be adversely affected by factors and conditions that
negatively affect the frequency with which our customers visit our garages, such as terrorism, social unrest and
political instability. We cannot accurately foresee the extent to which such events may affect our business,
directly or indirectly, in the future and cannot assure investors that we will choose or be able to obtain insurance
coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts or certain other events and any losses that could result from
these events. An actual or perceived terror threat, social unrest or internal instability in France or in our other
markets may negatively affect the frequency of our customers’ visits to our garages, which in turn could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.

Additionally, if there is a disruption at our warehouses (particularly at our key automated warehouse,
Logisteo) or branded garages, an interruption in our supply and logistics chain and/or suppliers are unable to
manufacture or deliver our products due to such catastrophic events, our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_Our growth strategy will require us to expand and improve our operations, and risks associated with our_**
**_expansion plans may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our growth strategy includes, among others, strengthening our market position in France, Benelux and Italy
and expanding into new geographical markets that offer logistics and purchasing synergies with our existing
operations. We may implement this strategy through organic growth, diversifying our activities or selected
acquisitions, such as the recent acquisition of Verviers Freins and Oscaro and future acquisitions in adjacent
geographies. Acquisitions pose additional risks, including paying too high a purchase price, the assumption of
unexpected liabilities and the impact of a change of control on the acquired business including with respect to
contracts and financing agreements. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions may depend on our
ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our
acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Our failure to identify suitable acquisition opportunities
may restrict our ability to grow our business. In addition, the integration of an acquired business and our systems,
operations and personnel, particularly in respect of businesses operating in adjacent markets, could be more
difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, which could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key
employees and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated operating savings.

Our logistics complexity will increase as our footprint grows. This increased complexity will require that we
continue to expand and improve our capabilities, including our IT and other logistics management capabilities, as
well as to grow, train and manage our employee base. We will also need to continually evaluate the adequacy of
our information and distribution systems, controls and procedures related to financial reporting. Implementing
new systems, controls and procedures and any changes to existing systems, controls and procedures could present
challenges that we do not anticipate and which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, this increased complexity will require us to continually evaluate whether
personnel with appropriate levels of expertise and experience are properly allocated in accordance with our
growth strategy, and any failure to allocate such personnel may make it more difficult to achieve our growth
strategy.

Our growth could also make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will need to make in
the future. This growth could impact the operational flexibility and reactivity of our supply chain and make us
unable to react as promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends as we have been able to do
historically. We may not be able to anticipate all of the demands that our expanding operations will impose on
our business, personnel, systems, controls and procedures, and our failure to appropriately address such demands
could materially adversely impact our existing operations and prevent us from implementing our growth strategy.

**_We may face challenges in integrating businesses that we have acquired or will acquire, and in expanding into_**
**_new markets and may be unable to realize the expected synergies and savings from these businesses or cost_**
**_improvement initiatives we have taken._**

In the past, we have occasionally acquired businesses in order to expand our operations. For example, in
2017, we expanded our operations in Italy with the creation of a joint company, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l.,
with three leading Italian distributors, OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto, and we also acquired a French windscreen
repair and replacement specialist, Mondial Pare-Brise. In 2018, we acquired a leading independent retailer of
multi-brand car body parts in Benelux (Geevers), an independent spare parts distributor in Italy (G-Group), a
multi-brand distributor of car body parts in Belgium (Verviers Freins) and an online distributor of light vehicle
spare parts in France (Oscaro). We could face significant challenges in managing and integrating an acquired
business into our business. For example, the integration of a business such as Oscaro, which has a different
business model to ours and primarily generates revenue from the B2C (DIY) segment, may prove difficult. The
acquisition of Oscaro or any future acquisition, requires the dedication of management resources that can
temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. Therefore, the process of integration can be more
difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, leading to increased operating costs, the loss of key employees
and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated synergies and operating savings, which can have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses or any future potential acquisition within a
reasonable time following our acquisition, we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits
thereof. In connection with the integration of recently acquired businesses or integrating any future potential
acquisition into our existing operating structure, we will seek to realize purchasing and cost savings. For
example, we often acquire targets, in part with the expectation that we would be able to integrate into our
business the performance of their distribution networks, improve their operating results and realize purchasing
and cost savings, particularly in the areas of procurement. Following the acquisition of Oscaro, we expect to
benefit from synergies on supplier contracts and cost saving initiatives (such as supply chain optimization, call
center rationalization and footprint optimization by concentrating non-core entities). There can be no guarantee
that we will be able to fully integrate operations of past and future acquired businesses into our business, or at all,
or that we will be in a position to realize some or all synergies and purchasing and cost savings when we acquire
such targets. To achieve any of the foregoing, we could also be required to make additional capital expenditures
which may be significant. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to
implement these measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve the
planned cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our
control. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these projects proves to have been incorrect,
these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or
realize in the anticipated time frame, the expected benefits from our cost measures. Furthermore, pricing pressure
from our customers or competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the benefits of the cost measures
that we have assumed that we will be able to implement. Also, cost efficiencies from expected improved logistics
and distribution processes may not be sustainable due to changes in customer needs, environmental law, logistics,
transportation costs or other cost variables.

In addition, our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of key
customers and suppliers. Our inability to realize the anticipated purchasing and cost savings and revenue
enhancements from an acquisition and other measures that we have taken could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In the future, we may acquire businesses or undertake investments or reorganizations in a targeted manner.
There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to identify suitable businesses or investment
opportunities and be able to acquire, or make the investment, on favorable terms. There is also a risk that not all
material risks in connection with the acquisition of a company or the making of investments have been identified
in the due diligence process and may not, therefore, be taken into account when deciding whether to acquire the
business or make the investment. These risks may materialize only after a company has been acquired or an
investment has been made, and may not be covered by the warranties in the related agreements or by insurance
policies.

In addition, expansion into new markets, such as our expansion in the Benelux market through the
acquisition of Doyen Auto, Geevers and Verviers Freins, entails greater risks than we face in our existing
markets and such risks may be inherently higher if the expansion is made through acquisitions, due to the risks
related to integrating acquired businesses. New markets may have different competitive and market conditions,
customer preferences and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. In particular, expansion into

34


-----

new geographic markets exposes us to risks related to cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as risks related to
navigating different legal and regulatory environments. We may also face a higher cost of entry, logistics
difficulties and minimal operating experience in such territories. Our product and service offering may not be
successful in new markets and our costs may increase due to cost overruns, unexpected delays or other
unforeseen factors. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to integrate new locations (regardless of
whether they are the result of organic growth or of acquisitions) into our network. Any of these factors could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Financial difficulties of our customers may require us to write off debts._**

Across each of our business lines, we rely on the ability of our customers to pay for the products that we
distribute. If an affiliated independent distributor or other customer undergoes financial difficulties, payments
can be significantly delayed and ultimately we may not be able to collect amounts payable to us under our
agreements, resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past
due. There can be no assurance, however, that such reserves are sufficiently large for the credit risks we face,
particularly in relation to our affiliated independent distributors. Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts
would adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our industry is highly competitive._**

We operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from a variety of types of spare parts
distributors and sellers in the highly fragmented Western European spare parts aftermarket, which comprises
Benelux, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and does not include the UK. We primarily compete on the basis of
product availability, delivery lead time, quality of service, product range and technical support. Our main
competitors are other light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors in France (such as Groupauto), Benelux
(such as LKQ) and Italy (such as LKQ), as well as new online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors
(such as eurocarparts.com and autopm24.eu), which mainly compete with us on the basis of price. We believe
that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the internet before making a purchase and generally
choose products with the most competitive price.

Over time, online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors may adopt our B2B distribution and
logistics model, reduce costs and demand lower prices for the spare parts they sell. Furthermore, in certain
countries, low-cost discount distributors have emerged that primarily compete on the basis of price and offer
lower prices for the spare parts that they sell, and such low-cost discount distributors may decide to enter the
French or one or more of our main markets. In addition, our competitors that currently purchase spare parts from
suppliers on a decentralized basis may consolidate their purchasing functions across their various operations,
subsidiaries or owned or Affiliated Distributors, and their purchasing scale may enable them to purchase spare
parts at prices that are lower than we can obtain. As a result, they may be able to offer certain spare parts to
customers at lower prices than we can. Our failure to adapt to these or other changes in the competitive landscape
could result in a low profit margin, decreased revenue and loss of market share and could therefore have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our customers also compete with spare parts suppliers and manufacturers (such as Bosch, Faurecia,
Knorr-Bremse and Valeo) and branded spare parts manufacturers (such as Peugeot, Fiat, Volkswagen and
Renault, including their affiliated dealers). Car dealers typically specialize in light vehicles and trucks aged zero
to four years old and capture a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties. Certain car
dealers, however, have extended their new light vehicle warranties to up to eight years, and provide for long-term
service programs to customers. If light vehicle and truck manufacturers continue to significantly expand (for
example, as a result of changes in the legal environment) the scope of their warranties beyond the current limits,
especially for replacement parts and maintenance items, these replacements and maintenance parts covered by
such extended warranties would likely be performed by car dealers instead of us. Additionally, car manufacturers
such as Peugeot are increasingly relying on their own logistics platforms to distribute light vehicle and truck
spare parts even outside the usual warranty periods and for all vehicle brands and types, which could reduce our
market share in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In addition, we may face more intense competition in the future if competitors adopt aggressive pricing
policies, expand their distribution networks, undertake more extensive marketing and advertising campaigns,
offer more appealing products or adapt more quickly to changes in customer preferences and trends. Certain of
our competitors may possess greater financial resources, newer or better technology and materials, larger

35


-----

purchasing economies of scale and/or lower cost bases, integrated manufacturing capabilities, stronger name
recognition and/or entrenched relationships with suppliers, any of which may give them a competitive advantage
over us and could result in a loss of our market share.

**_Our sales depend on the age, condition, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks used in France,_**
**_Benelux and Italy and the length of service intervals._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by the age, condition, number and mileage of
light vehicles and trucks used in France and other markets in which we operate, and the length of service
intervals in those markets. We consider our core market to be light vehicles and trucks aged over four years. As
light vehicles and trucks get older, expenses for light vehicle and truck spare parts generally increase. A decline
in the age of light vehicles and trucks could lead to decreased demand for the products that we distribute and our
services.

A decline in the use of light vehicles could result in a related decrease in demand for light vehicle spare
parts. Factors such as higher gasoline prices or gasoline taxes, a significant deterioration in economic conditions,
environmental concerns or limitations on tax breaks for commuting costs and the introduction of a road charge
for light vehicles and trucks and potential speed limits in cities could reduce light vehicle and truck spending.
Similarly, changes in traveling or commuting behavior (for example, through the increased use of public
transport or light vehicle sharing) or continuing urbanization could decrease the average mileage of light vehicles
and demand for the products that we distribute and our services. Such a decline in demand could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The condition of vehicles could also impact demand for our products and services, with lower-quality
vehicles requiring more frequent and more costly maintenance and repairs, while more expensive vehicles may
require more expensive replacement parts. The size of the car parc or truck fleet is also a demand driver. The
number of vehicles in use is a function of new vehicle sales and vehicle scrappage rates and a steady or growing
total vehicle population supports continued demand for maintenance and repair. Finally, average annual mileage
of vehicles in the car parc or truck fleet impacts demand for our products and services because higher mileage,
like vehicle age, increases the need for maintenance and replacement.

A decrease in the average age of the car parc or truck fleet, driven by increased purchases of new light
vehicles and trucks, could lead to decreased demand in the short-term for our products and services, although
such purchases would also increase the size of the car parc or truck fleet, potentially stimulating demand for our
products and services on the mid- to long-term. For example, the French government is currently developing
incentives for drivers that are intended to phase out older, polluting vehicles. The outcomes of these efforts are
not yet known but could lead in the short-term to decreases in the size of the older car parc if drivers choose to
scrap older vehicles and replace them with new vehicles. Likewise, a decline in the number of, or mileage on,
light vehicles and trucks and in our addressable spare parts aftermarket could lead to decreased demand for the
products that we distribute and our services.

We believe that light vehicle and truck repairs are currently being made at a later date and to a lesser extent.
The technological and qualitative improvements of many light vehicle and truck components can lead to a
decrease in demand for light vehicle and truck spare parts, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may fail to successfully anticipate demand or manage our inventory and services commensurate with such_**
**_demand._**

One of the key parameters of our business is operational efficiency in general and inventory management in
particular. If orders and inventory do not efficiently match demand at any particular time and location, either in
terms of the quantity or nature of products, we could have higher or lower than anticipated inventory levels,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results. For example, if products remain
unsold, we may need to reduce selling prices, resulting in lower margins, or may need to incur higher charges to
store inventory or transport it to other markets within our network where there may be greater demand. We may
also be required to incur further inventory depreciation. Conversely, if we fail to stock sufficient quantities of
high- selling products or cannot provide in-demand services, we could lose sales and our reputation with
customers could be damaged. Furthermore, we may not be able to appropriately respond to the preferences of
customers in markets outside France, our original market, where customers could have different needs than
French customers. If we are unable to appropriately align our inventory and services with consumer demand, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_Disruptions in our IT systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We depend on the timely implementation and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network,
websites, ordering platforms, call centers and other IT systems, including those which may be provided by third
parties or which may be hosted online or in the “cloud” for the smooth functioning of our operations, and in
particular with respect to Oscaro. The various software we use and develop in collaboration with third-party
software companies facilitates our ability to efficiently manage supply flows, operational data and other
management and financial information, and to provide management with current inventory levels at our
warehouses. In particular, our customized IT systems allow us to identify, in real time, the availability of any
particular product that is ordered within our distribution network. We depend on the continuous availability and
reliability of our IT platform, which, in turn, depends on the functioning of our IT hardware and is, therefore,
subject to operational risks such as the occurrence of equipment failures, power interruptions and unlawful
conduct by third parties. The performance of our IT systems also depends, among other things, on our ability to
effectively safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage from interruptions to
telecommunication services, data breaches (including breaches that result in the theft or compromise of customer
data), hacking and phishing attempts and the introduction of malware and computer viruses. The occurrence of
any such events, and any consequent slowdown or interruption to telecommunication services may impair our
ability to manage supply flows, operational data and other management and financial information and to provide
management with current inventory levels at our warehouse, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

For example, we have recently upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT management system of
our light vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage our inventory more efficiently. The upgrade of
our existing IT systems or the implementation of new IT systems may cause organizational disruptions within
our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new warehouse IT management system, or any
future IT systems, will deliver the projected efficiencies.

One of our strategies is to increase sales of products that we distribute through our websites. The
implementation of this strategy will require additional IT resources and may result in a disruption to our existing
computer and telecommunications systems, whether in connection with the implementation of expanded
capabilities or otherwise, which could, in turn, adversely affect our online sales and/or our business reputation.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain and upgrade our IT systems in a manner that will avoid
interruptions or disruptions of such systems. Any failure or inability to maintain and upgrade our IT systems may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We rely on software and information systems licensed from third parties and any failure or interruption in_**
**_products or services provided by these third parties and inability to replace them adequately could harm our_**
**_ability to operate our business._**

Our information technology systems, including key business automation systems and applications used in
reporting and analysis for business planning have been licensed from third-parties. We rely on the applicable
licensor to provide maintenance, technical support and periodic upgrades so that the relevant system or
application can continue to support our business. If we or these developers fail to maintain and upgrade these
information systems and software programs, the efficiency of our operations could be disrupted or reduced
partially if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, which could in turn
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Continued technological advancements in light vehicle and truck parts could affect our sales._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by technological and qualitative improvements in
new light vehicles and trucks, and the light vehicle and truck market is characterized by frequent technical
advances and increases in the complexity of existing components. Certain light vehicle and truck spare parts may
feature complex or innovative technology that can only be maintained by persons with special training or at
specialized garages. Our success depends in large part on our ability to access, follow, interpret and react to
changing technological and qualitative specifications in an appropriate and timely manner. Our products and
services must be adapted to the technological needs of a broad range of customers, which may not be foreseeable
with certainty and are subject to change.

In order to efficiently develop our products and services, we need to access new and detailed information on
new light vehicles and trucks provided by light vehicle and truck manufacturers. If such manufacturers were to

37


-----

refuse to provide appropriate and timely access to such information, or if a new regulation were to limit access to
such information, we would be unable to efficiently develop our products and services, which would have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

New light vehicle technology may also require continuous training and regular updating in relation to a
particular light vehicle or truck model. For example, repairs of sensors as well as repairs of air conditioning
systems require special skills, training and equipment. The independent garages that are the primary end-users of
the parts we distribute may not continue to obtain the information and training necessary to maintain the complex
technology featured in our end-customers’ vehicles, and the expertise to install and repair these parts may only be
available at car dealers. Moreover, the expenses required for specialized staff training as well as the sophisticated
equipment required to test and repair these evolving components could result in higher costs or higher capital
expenditure for us or for our end-customers. In certain cases, it may no longer be economically feasible for
independent garages to offer repair services for particular light vehicle and truck models or spare parts.
Furthermore, sophisticated manufacturing technology for light vehicle and truck spare parts improves their
quality and reduces the number of replacements and repairs they require. If light vehicle and truck spare parts are
replaced less frequently, our revenue could decrease.

The IAM in which we operate differs from the OEM, in which operators are linked to the light vehicle
manufacturers who directly supply them with the necessary technical information on vehicle components and
repair procedures. Due to ongoing technological developments in the manufacturing of light vehicles and trucks,
independent garages need to develop appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components. The failure
of independent garages to develop the appropriate technical expertise, or access to the tools, instruments and
parts that such technological developments demand, may result in an increase in demand for maintenance and
repair services provided by car dealers with the necessary technical expertise (which garages represent a small
portion of our revenues), which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Our business depends in part on a strong brand image and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our_**
**_brand or market our product offerings we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers or sell_**
**_sufficient quantities of the products that we distribute._**

We believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our
business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands are integral to the success of our
business and to the implementation of our growth strategy. This will require us to make further investments in
areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as our website operations. For example, we have developed
websites for each of our distributors and garages and we invest in large customer events, such as an event to
develop our brand that we organized in September 2018. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will
depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising effort, and our ability to provide good
customer experiences. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our
public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Our brand image may also be diminished if
we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient delivery of quality products, if
we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities, if we fail to
comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or
reputation. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we distributed products to
approximately 3,197 branded garages and 87 distributors, including 34 wholly-owned distributors and
53 Affiliated Distributors. We have entered into a master affiliation agreement with all of our affiliated
independent distributors, which is renewed every seven years, and we enter into agreements with each of our
light vehicle branded garages, which are renewed annually. These branded garages and affiliated independent
distributors, which we do not control, may take actions or make decisions that adversely affect our brand and
reputation.

Our principal brand names and trademarks, such as Autodistribution, Doyen, Garage Expert AD, Mondial
Pare-Brise, Auto Primo, Autossimo, Truckissimo, AD Poids Lourds and ISOTECH, the “AD” logo, and since the
Doyen Auto Acquisition, 1,2,3 AutoService, Requal and API, and since the acquisitions of G-Group and Oscaro,
the Xenergy and Oscaro brands, respectively, are key assets of our business. See “Business—Information
_technology—Intellectual property.” We are not aware of any material violations or infringements of our_
intellectual property rights as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. However, there is no assurance that third
parties will not infringe our intellectual property rights in the future in ways that will have negative repercussions
on our reputation, business and results of operations or that measures taken by us will be effective in protecting
our intellectual property rights. In the event that third parties unlawfully infringe on our intellectual property

38


-----

rights, we may face considerable difficulties and costly litigation in order to fully protect our intellectual property
rights, which may in turn materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and prospects.

Third parties have in the past and may in the future assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly
as we expand our business to include new products and product categories and moves into other geographic
markets. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming, and could
divert management attention. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary
liability and prevent us from distributing certain products or employing certain brand names and trademarks. In
addition, the resolution of claims may require us to abandon or redesign our products or branding materials,
acquire license rights from third parties or cease using those rights altogether, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect our intellectual
property rights, but we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken or will take in the future will be
adequate to prevent any violation or challenges to our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that
litigation will not be necessary in order to enforce our trademark or other intellectual property rights or to defend
ourselves against third-party claims of infringement of their rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other
factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brands and trademarks, which could, in turn, lead to
decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our marketing and communications strategy may prove ineffective._**

Our advertising and marketing expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017, were €6.7 million, and
consisted primarily of online marketing and promotional campaigns for certain of our products. We will continue
to invest in such marketing initiatives, particularly through our websites. Our branded garages and Mondial
Pare-Brise, Doyen Auto and Oscaro also engage in their own marketing campaigns. The results of these
investments may be unsuccessful or fail to provide sufficient return on investment. Our failure to implement our
marketing initiatives, or their failure to increase revenue, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,
results of operations and financial position and on the implementation of our growth strategy.

**_If our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations, our_**
**_brands and reputation may be damaged._**

While our operating guidelines promote ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility, fair
wage practices and compliance with child labor laws, among others, through commitments in suppliers’ contracts
to apply our ethical charter, we do not control our third-party suppliers or their business practices and our
contractual remedies with respect to supplier practices are limited. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that
suppliers will comply with our guidelines. As a result, from time to time our suppliers or manufacturers may not
be in compliance with local labor law or recognized ethical or environmental standards, among other things. A
lack of compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in
delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions to our operations. Violation of
anti-money laundering, bribery, environmental or labor or other laws by our third-party suppliers or the
divergence of a third-party supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the
European Union could also lead to liability and attract negative publicity on our business and harm the integrity
of our brands. Any incident calling into question the integrity of our suppliers and their business practices could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and our insurance premiums may increase_**
**_substantially._**

We carry various types of insurance that cover the risks associated with the ordinary operation of our
business, including general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, fleet, IT, property and workers’
compensation insurance. Given the diversity of locations and settings in which we distribute our products and
provide services and the range of activities our employees and us engage in, we may not always be able to
accurately foresee all activities and situations in order to ensure full coverage by the terms of our insurance
policies and as a result, we may not be covered by insurance in specific instances. While we seek to maintain
appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable and we may experience major incidents of a nature
not covered, in whole or in part, by insurance. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events resulting in
substantial claims for damages in a calendar year may lead to increases in our insurance premiums and our

39


-----

insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or material
price increases in the insurance market in general. We may not be able to maintain our current insurance
coverage or do so at a reasonable cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Our lease obligations may limit our operating flexibility._**

We lease most of our locations from third-party landlords. In order to optimize our real estate portfolio and
respond to changes in demographics or other conditions at specific locations, we may seek to exit certain leases
at regular intervals and obtain new leases in new locations that provide similar flexibility. Our ability to negotiate
lease terminations or modifications on acceptable terms or at all may be limited. For example, in France,
commercial leases generally provide for a minimum nine-year term, with breakpoints at the end of each
three-year period, and include strict termination and renewal provisions, including the possibility of a rent
increase if the lease is renewed after the initial nine-year term. If we are unable to terminate the leases of
locations that are no longer consistent with our strategy, we may incur expenses in relation to the termination of
such leases. In addition, third-party landlords may also seek to terminate certain of our leases, which may require
us to relocate some of our operations. If we cannot terminate leases for unprofitable or vacant locations, or if the
termination or modification of leases results in significant costs, our business, results of operations and financial
condition may be materially adversely affected.

**_We risk the theft or the misappropriation of funds and products in our warehouses and other facilities._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to the risk of theft of products in our warehouses and
other facilities. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur any losses due to the theft of products in
our facilities. Products may also be misappropriated during transportation. We carry no insurance for the theft of
our products. Occasionally, our locations may be the targets of successful or unsuccessful robbery attempts by
third parties. We may also from time to time experience a misappropriation of funds in our facilities or at other
levels of our business. Any such theft or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

**_The products that we provide may be exposed to price and margin pressures, and we may be unable to attract_**
**_new customers and retain existing customers at competitive pricing and margin levels._**

We may be forced to decrease prices for the products that we distribute due to a number of factors, such as
challenging macroeconomic conditions or increased competition. In our industry, both light vehicle and truck
spare parts manufacturers set retail prices through official recommended prices for the end-customer. Each
participant in the value chain, including us, then sets our prices as a percentage of the recommended price on the
basis of our targeted gross margin. We may be unable to compensate for a decrease in recommended retail prices
by obtaining supplier rebates, attracting new business, reducing our operating costs (for example, through
headcount reductions, increases in labor productivity or other gains in cost efficiency) or otherwise, which could
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Price and margin pressures
may therefore lead to a reduction in average prices and margins for our services, which could also have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A decrease in the number of affiliated independent distributors in our network or a decrease in demand for_**
**_certain key spare parts may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our principal customers are light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors and professional garages. We
entered into affiliation agreements with 31 affiliated independent light vehicle spare parts distributors in France
as of December 31, 2017. These agreements allow these affiliated independent distributors to use the
Autodistribution brand and to benefit from commercial conditions we negotiate with our suppliers and from
loyalty bonuses. We renewed our agreements with our affiliated independent distributors on April 13, 2015, for a
further seven years. We also entered into agreements with 3,197 branded garages in France as of December 31,
2017. These agreements allow branded garages to use one of our brands, including Garage AD, Garage AD
Expert, Auto Primo, 1,2,3 AutoService, Requal and API, and in return the independent garages designate our
distributors as their preferred distributors and are eligible for certain rebates. If any of these distributors or
garages were to breach their agreements with us by prematurely terminating their relationship with us, the size of
our distribution network and our customer base could be reduced and our profitability significantly harmed as a
result.

40


-----

In addition, our customers mostly purchase light vehicle and truck spare parts based on their existing needs,
but are not required to purchase a minimum amount of any of the products that we distribute. Therefore, a
significant decrease in demand for certain key spare parts for both light vehicles and trucks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that we do not
maintain our existing level of business with our customers, we will need to attract new customers or win new
business with our existing customers and if we are unable to do so, our business, results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.

**_We are dependent on our network of distributors and our branded garages and our revenue may decrease if_**
**_our distributors and branded garages do not generate sufficient sales or if our relationships with our branded_**
**_garages deteriorate._**

Our business is organized around CPUs, which buy aftermarket spare parts and equipment and tools from
our suppliers, which are then sold to our local wholly-owned distributors (“wholly-owned distributors”),
affiliated independent distributors and online retailers. These distributors then sell these parts, equipment and
tools to garages, some of which are affiliated with us and operate under our brands. Our revenue depends on the
ability of our distributors and branded garages to generate sales and our overall success is dependent on our
ability to maintain our relationships with them and further grow our network. Our revenue is dependent on the
sales of such distributors and, in turn, those of the branded garages, and the quality of the relationship we have
with them. Any deterioration in these sales or relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

We occasionally terminate or choose not to renew our relationships with certain of our branded garages and,
from time to time, certain branded garages may terminate or choose not to renew their relationships with us. Such
terminations or non-renewals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition in the future. However, there is no guarantee that the historically low rates of such
terminations will continue in the future. Furthermore, we may not be successful in replacing or offsetting any
such terminated or non-renewed branded garage relationships with new or expanded branded garage relationships
in the future, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_The departure of members of our management team or other key personnel, or our inability to attract and_**
**_retain qualified management or other key personnel, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

Our success is largely dependent upon the continued service and skills of our existing management team. If
one or more of our executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present
positions, we may not be able to replace them easily and our business may be disrupted, which may materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Competition for management and
key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited, so we may not be able to attract and
retain experienced executive or key personnel in the future, which could hinder our ability to run and develop our
business successfully. In addition, if any of our executives or other key personnel joins a competitor or forms a
competing company, we may lose customers, know-how and other key personnel, which may have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and employment, and_**
**_changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our business, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to
labor, employment, health and safety. The modification, suspension, repeal or expiration of favorable provisions
in labor and employment laws and regulations or, conversely, any increases of mandatory minimum wages
pursuant to laws, regulations or collective bargaining agreements, or of social security contributions, may
negatively impact our business and profitability.

For example, in France we benefit from reductions in employer social security contributions on certain
wages pursuant to law 2003-47 of January 17, 2003, as completed by law 2008–1258 of December 3, 2008 (the
“Fillon Law”), as well as from a tax credit for competitiveness and employment (crédit d’impôt pour la
_compétitivité et l’emploi) (“CICE”). Pursuant to CICE, French companies receive a tax credit of 7% of the gross_
salaries paid in 2017 and 6% of the gross salaries paid in 2018. The amount of the CICE is calculated on the basis

41


-----

of gross salaries paid in the course of each calendar year to employees whose wages are less than or equal to
2.5 times the French statutory minimum wage. The Fillon Law allows employers to benefit from reductions in
such social security contributions in respect of wages that amount to less than 1.6 times the French statutory
minimum wage. However, Article 86 of the Finance Law for 2018 (law 2017-1837 of December 30, 2017)
abolished the CICE for salaries paid as from January 1, 2019. This will result in the elimination of the positive
impact of the CICE on our results of operations. Another concurrently enacted law (law 2017-1836 of
December 30, 2017) partly balanced the elimination of the CICE by decreasing, under certain conditions, by
six points the rate of one of the employer’s social security contributions as from January 1, 2019. However, we
cannot assure at this stage that this decrease will effectively provide us with an advantage comparable to the
benefit of the CICE.

Any unfavorable changes in the Fillon Law, CICE or other labor and employment laws and regulations, or
in the terms of collective bargaining agreements applicable to our business, as well as any increases of the
statutory minimum wage in any country or industry in which we operate, may increase our payroll costs and
negatively affect our operating margins and operational flexibility, and therefore may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the impact of laws and
regulations, particularly labor and employment laws and regulations, may restrict our ability to achieve cost
reductions and other efficiency gains.

In January 2013, an agreement was reached between national employer representatives and trade unions in
France regarding certain labor market reforms. Many provisions of this agreement now appear in the law on job
security published on June 14, 2013. This law provides, among other things, additional charges on fixed-term
employment contracts, greater regulation of part-time employment and an extension of the scope of
complementary health benefits to all employees. As a result of these reforms, we amended our health benefit
agreements as our health insurance provider was not able to cover the same level of healthcare costs. Another
labor law was implemented in 2018 and we cannot yet assess the impact of these recent measures on our future
operations, but they may have an adverse impact on our costs. Labor market reform in general continues to be a
key policy measure on the French government’s political agenda, and changes in any of the above-mentioned
laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations could substantially increase our
operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_French and foreign tax legislation, tax audits or disputes and our results may restrict our ability to use French_**
**_tax loss carry-forwards._**

We may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from
discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss
carry-forwards from our subsidiaries. We had a total of €431.9 million tax loss carry-forwards, fully generated
within our current French tax consolidated group as of December 31, 2017. The actual realization of these assets
in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of
the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French tax code (Code général
_des impôts) (the “French Tax Code”), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset the_
taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of the taxable
profit exceeding €1 million. Any reduction in our ability to use these tax assets due to changes in laws and
regulations, potential tax reassessment or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may be required to pay certain indemnities in connection with our divested Polish subsidiary._**

In August 2017, we divested our Polish subsidiary, AD Polska, to Rhino Bidco S.p.A., a wholly owned
subsidiary of LKQ Corporation. In connection with this divestiture, we agreed to provide an indemnity to AD
Polska for losses resulting from certain potential intellectual property related and tax-related claims in line with
market practice. Although this indemnity is capped and time limited, we cannot predict with accuracy whether
and what amounts we may be required to pay.

**_A failure to meet our labor needs, a deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions or a_**
**_failure to extend, renew or renegotiate on favorable terms our collective bargaining agreements could have an_**
**_adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

As of December 31, 2017, we had 5,974 employees. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling
labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel

42


-----

in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health
and other insurance costs, union membership levels and activity among our employees and changes in
employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. Likewise, maintaining good relationships with our
employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result, a failure to meet
our labor needs or any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other employee
representatives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See
“Business—Employees.”

Some of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining agreements. These agreements
typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other things, the general working
conditions of our employees such as maximum working hours, holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and
incentives. National collective bargaining agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions
that could affect our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees. We may not be
able to extend existing company-specific agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the expiration
of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or without work stoppages,
strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also become subject to additional company-specific agreements or
amendments to the existing national collective bargaining agreements. Such additional company-specific
agreements or amendments may increase our operating costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

While in the last three years we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as a result of
strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes, such events could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of
reputation, increased wages and benefits, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Additionally, national collective bargaining agreements and company-specific agreements often contain
provisions that could limit our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees, which
could limit our ability to execute our strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Increased employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our labor costs may rise faster than expected in the future as a result of a larger workforce, salary increases
and headcount increases. We may be unable to offset the increase in labor costs through increased selling prices
or productivity gains. In recent years, we have benefited from government programs in certain European
countries designed to favor employment, including recent labor reforms that effectively reduce the costs
associated with hiring new employees. There can be no assurance that such programs will continue or that we
will continue to benefit from such programs and that labor costs will not increase as a result. If labor costs
increase further, our operating costs will also increase, which could, if we are unable to recover these cost
increases from our customers through increased selling prices or offset such cost increases through labor
productivity gains or other measures, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Employment, environmental, health and safety regulations relating to our operations could subject us to_**
**_increasing costs or fines._**

Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of European directives and regulations, national,
state and local laws, rules, taxes and regulations relating to the protection of employees, the environment,
workers’ health and safety, and the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and
other regulated materials. These include, in particular, requirements governing employee hours, the disposal of
used oil, batteries, tires and other materials processed in our recycling business. These laws, rules and regulations
may affect the way in which we conduct our operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could
lead to fines and other penalties as well as negative publicity which could damage our brands and reputation. In
addition, various environmental laws also may make us liable for the costs of cleaning up and responding to
hazardous substances that may have been released on our properties, including releases unknown that are
unknown to us. These environmental laws and regulations also could require us to pay for environmental
remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we have disposed of or recycled hazardous
substances. With environmental regulations becoming increasingly stringent, the cost of complying with the
various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could materially adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to fluctuation, which could have an adverse_**
**_effect on our financial condition._**

Our working capital requirements and cash flows have historically been, and are expected to continue to be,
subject to seasonal and yearly fluctuations, depending on a number of factors. Factors that could result in cash
flow fluctuations include the level of sales and the related margins of those sales, the collection of receivables,
the timing and size of purchases of inventories and related components, the timing of payments for such
purchases, and the terms and timing of payments for payables and accrued liabilities, as well as prevailing
economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are
unable to manage fluctuations in working capital requirements and cash flow, our business, results of operations
and financial condition may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to make required interest
payments on our indebtedness.

If our working capital requirements exceed our other cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash
balances and availability for borrowings under our financing arrangements to satisfy those needs, as well as
potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds,
including under our Revolving Credit Facility, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital
requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow sufficient funds to
meet our working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures,
refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to sell assets or equity or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty or recall claims that may_**
**_be brought against us._**

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the products that we sell,
particularly the truck spare parts we sell, actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our
product results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. Accordingly, we could
experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these
claims. In addition, if any of the products that we distribute are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be
required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety. We may not
be able to pass these liabilities through to the product manufacturer, whether due to unfavorable supplier
warranties or supplier credit issues. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our brand, reputation and relationships with our customers could also be damaged by the distribution of
defective products, especially in the event of serious defects, such as incorporating harmful substances that cause
physical harm or other health problems. Such serious defects could also lead to a significant decline in revenue.
There is also a risk that compliance lapses by our international suppliers could occur, which could lead to
investigation by agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement
actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. In all such cases, especially if
there is a prolonged impact on product quality or availability, our business, results of operations, financial
condition and reputation may be materially adversely affected.

**_We rely on certain certifications for the operation of our Trucks segment and the loss of such certifications_**
**_could harm our business._**

In the ordinary course of our truck spare parts distribution and repair business, we install, checks and
calibrates digital and analog tracking devices that record and report the speed and distance (also known as
tachography) driven by trucks. We rely on certifications granted by the French government in order to perform
these services. The regulations governing such certifications are subject to change and we cannot guarantee that
we will be permitted to install, check and calibrate such tracking devices in the future. Additionally, our truck
repair network is certified by the “Qualicert” program, which offers third-party verification of service quality by
SGS, a private certification provider. If we fail to qualify for or maintain any of these certifications, or if the
requirements for such certifications become more stringent, our business, results of operations, financial
condition and reputation may be materially adversely affected.

44

**_We could face exposure to product liability claims for products that we import from countries outside the_**
**_European Union and sell under our own trademark._**

As a distributor of spare parts, we may be held liable for defective products if we brand products with our
trademark, such as ISOTECH, and present ourselves as the producer of such products or we distribute products
imported from countries outside the European Union. Some of the products that we distribute are branded with
our ISOTECH trademark. In addition, we sell products imported from countries outside the European Union. By
selling products under our trademark or imported from countries outside the European Union, we may be held
liable for any unforeseen defects in products requiring repair under warranty or recall, which, notwithstanding
possible recourse against the relevant manufacturer and supplier, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Likewise, if our affiliated independent distributors or
branded garages improperly install products, we may be exposed to liability and reputational harm. Additionally,
we can offer no assurance that suppliers will replace defective products in a timely manner or provide us with
sufficient refunds or indemnifications. We could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the
future and incur significant costs to defend any such claims.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, which could adversely affect our business,_**
**_results of operations and financial condition._**

From time to time we are involved in labor, tax and commercial legal proceedings, relating to the conduct of
our business including, but not limited to, claims from our employees, claims of intellectual property
infringement and claims asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices by third parties, the outcomes
of which are difficult to predict. In addition, from time to time, we are subject to product liability and personal
injury claims relating to the products we sell and the properties we operate. In particular, French law provides for
specific protection for consumers in the area of liability for defective products. We are and have been subject to
various tax audits and may be subject to tax audits from time to time in the future. In addition, we could face a
wide variety of employee claims against us, including general discrimination, privacy, labor and employment and
disability claims. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory
proceedings being brought against us by various governmental agencies.

We could become involved in legal disputes in the future which may involve substantial claims for damages
or other payments. Although individually these proceedings do not typically involve substantial amounts, in the
aggregate such proceedings or any increase in the number of such proceedings may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2017, our provision for
litigation amounted to €3.7 million.

In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a
settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the costs related to litigation
proceedings may be significant. Even where we successfully defend ourselves against a claim, we might still
have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants,
insurance or otherwise. Even if there is a positive outcome of such proceedings, any negative publicity
surrounding claims against us or our management, products or services could materially adversely affect our
brands and reputation. All of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition and reputation.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our business, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws,
including the elimination of CICE, could adversely affect our tax position, such as our effective tax rate or tax
payments. In addition, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to
varying interpretations.

Furthermore, the current incorporation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the
final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related
Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative efforts within our
business and impact existing structures.

The European Union is itself pursuing its work on the harmonization of the tax legislation of the Member
States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a

45


-----

directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal
market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on
May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of
the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries. Amongst the set of proposed measures, the ATAD
provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses would
be limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a
maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such new rules shall in
principle apply as from January 2019. In this respect, Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 20181317 of December 28, 2018) transposed into French tax law the general interest limitation rule provided for by
the ATAD with effect as from January 1, 2019. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—French tax
_legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our_
_indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more_
details on this rule. The Council of the European Union also adopted on February 21, 2017 a new directive in
order to address hybrid mismatches with non-EU Member States that will come into force on January 1, 2020.
However, the French Finance Law for 2019 does not include any particular modification of the existing French
anti-hybrid legislation in order to introduce under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2. Such
modifications are expected to occur at a later stage so that the provisions of the ATAD 2 apply in France as from
January 1, 2020 (or potentially January 1, 2022, for certain provisions).

Furthermore, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced the anti-abuse provision provided
for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that
are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities might
ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or
one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law,
are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances.

Finally, the European Commission has published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016
including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base
(“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding
loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing
new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on
the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of
the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. These
new regulations could impact our tax position in the future.

We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which
we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of
these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could
require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to
track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax_**
**_purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where we operate may impact our financial results._**

The Council of the European Union adopted on December 5, 2017 its conclusions on the EU list of
non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the “Council Conclusions”) which is composed of two sub-lists
(respectively, the “Black List” and the “Grey List,” together referred to as the “EU List”). The EU List was
established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the
Council during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions. The Black List, which shall be updated at
least once a year, is currently composed of the following five jurisdictions: American Samoa, Guam, Samoa,
Trinidad and Tobago, and United States Virgin Islands. Furthermore, the Council published a Grey List of
screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order to comply with the
European Union screening criteria.

Moreover, though there is no applicable sanction yet, EU Member States are encouraged by the Council
Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as
increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse
provisions. A new French law that aims at fighting fraud was published on October 24, 2018 (Law 2018-898 of

46


-----

October 23, 2018) and expands under certain conditions the French tax regime regarding the non-cooperative
States and jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code to certain States and
jurisdictions included into the Black List.

**_Our business may be materially adversely affected by VAT rate increases in the countries where we operate._**

As of December 31, 2017, our products were subject to VAT in each of the countries where we operate with
different applicable rates set by each such country. For example, the VAT rates that are applicable to us are 20%
in France, 21% in Belgium, 21% in the Netherlands and 22% in Italy. From 2010 to 2012, European
governments increased VAT rates in order to bolster public finances, and there can be no assurance that VAT
rates will not be further increased in the future. Our published retail prices are inclusive of VAT.

If VAT rates were to increase in the future, our profitability margins will be negatively impacted if we do
not increase the prices of our products to match the increase in VAT. However, if we pass the increase in VAT
on to our customers by raising the prices of our products, the demand for our products may decline, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we
face VAT risks arising out of our operating activities in the normal course of business and typical acquisitionrelated VAT risks relating to prior acquisitions and reorganizations.

**_Changes to accounting standards may affect our reporting of financial results._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. Any changes in
these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our reported results and financial condition. In
particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain IFRS
standards have been recently revised by the IASB. Notably, the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases) may have an
impact on the manner in which we carry out our financial reporting.

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases) and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and will result in
almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is
eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a
financial liability to pay rental expenses. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. We will apply
IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, its mandatory application date. We intend to apply the simplified transition
approach and will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption. IFRS 16 will affect
primarily the accounting for our operating leases. We estimate that the implementation of IFRS 16 will result in
an increase in total assets of approximately €140 million to €150 million, in total liabilities of approximately
€140 million to €150 million and in EBITDA of approximately €37 million to €40 million, based on our
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information as of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018. Our activities as a lessor are not material and therefore we do not expect any significant
impact on our financial statements.

In addition to these new standards, the IASB may in the future adopt further changes or additions to IFRS,
which we may be obligated to adopt and the impact of which would be initially uncertain.

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable national competition and antitrust laws, as well as the rules and
regulations of the European Union. We are subject to the Law on the Modernization of the Economy (2008), the
Hamon Law (2014) and the Macron Law (2015) which provide for various mandatory obligations, including
annual renegotiation of purchasing and customer agreements and payment terms as well as in relation to
information provided on websites. We may become subject to legal action or investigations and proceedings by
national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of antitrust laws, which
could result in fines or other forms of liability, or otherwise damage our business reputation, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such laws and regulations
could limit or prohibit our ability to grow in certain markets.

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes._**

Bain Capital indirectly owns the majority of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, our shareholders have and
will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the
ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations and to control the

outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances
may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to
pay our obligations as they mature. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional
indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and
hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also pursue
acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities
may not be available to us. In addition, our shareholders may hold interests in suppliers or customers of ours. Our
shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or
other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions
might involve risks to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes**

**_Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations_**
**_of its own and will depend on cash from its operating subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes._**

Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company with no business operations other than the
equity interests it will hold in its subsidiaries, and in the case of the Issuer, certain operations related to the
management of our Group. We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, separate and distinct
legal entities. Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will be dependent upon the cash flow from their
operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations,
including the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Parent Guarantor’s obligations under
its Guarantee. The amount of dividends and distributions available to each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor
will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue
dividends under applicable law or existing contracts, including the restrictions contained in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. The subsidiaries of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor, however, may not be able to, or may
not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor to make payments in respect of their respective obligations, including under the Senior Secured Notes
and the guarantee of the Parent Guarantor. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including all of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than Autodistribution S.A.S.), that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes
have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

The amount enforceable under the Guarantees may be limited, and the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations
_on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a_
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the
Guarantee of Autodistribution S.A.S. is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the
outstanding amount under certain proceeds loans, which is currently €282 million and corresponds to the
aggregate of the proceeds loan made available to on-lend the proceeds of prior issuances of the Senior Secured
Notes to the Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be similarly limited.

None of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries will have any obligation to pay amounts due under the
Senior Secured Notes or to make funds available for that purpose, including subsidiaries that are borrowers under
the Revolving Credit Facility but do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. Generally, holders of indebtedness
of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are
entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for
distribution to the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor as a direct or indirect shareholder of such subsidiaries.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) and the Parent Guarantor
will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

   - the creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or the
Parent Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary.

48


-----

As such, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. As of
September 30, 2018, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries would have
had total debt of €89.7 million (excluding bank overdrafts), all of which would have ranked structurally senior to
the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. Any of the debt that the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur
in the future in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have and, after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of September 30, 2018, and as
adjusted to give effect to the acquisitions of Verviers Freins and Oscaro and the Refinancing, our pro forma
third-party borrowings would have been €967.7 million, which reflects external loans and borrowings (including
finance leases), of which €175.0 million would have been represented by the Senior Secured Notes. The terms of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial
additional indebtedness, including, but not limited to, in respect of committed borrowings of up to €90.0 million
under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.”

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations, including, but
not limited to:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and
our other debt and liabilities;

   - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt,
thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and
capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater
financial resources than we have;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and
industry;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

   - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

   - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity
capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including the Senior Secured Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our
indebtedness and to fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject,
in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are
beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital
to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Senior Secured Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur
will be structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes if such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Senior Secured
Notes, and such debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Senior Secured Notes. Although the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture contain, and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount
of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Borrowings
under debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Senior Secured
Notes, may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. We may be unable to pay these debts in

49


-----

such circumstances. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described above.
In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture do not, and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will not, prevent us from incurring obligations or entering into other arrangements that
do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, such as receivables securitization financings. For a
discussion of our cash flow and liquidity, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and
_results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources.”_

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside_**
**_our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which_**
**_may not be successful._**

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable
us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including the Senior Secured Notes. If our future cash
flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our
liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, on or before
maturity. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives in
a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time.
Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or
future debt instruments and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these
alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative
financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of
our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able
to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Senior Secured Notes. In such an event, borrowings under
other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions may become
payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Senior Secured
Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a
timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur
additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and
other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, restrict our ability to transfer or sell
assets and to use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions
or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do
realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due.

**_We are subject to covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default under our debt_**
**_covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

Our Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture contain, and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will contain, covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate,
including restrictions on our ability to:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

   - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

   - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

50


-----

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

   - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

   - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary;

   - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

   - sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

   - change the “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) of the Luxembourg Security Providers;

   - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes; and

   - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants.” These covenants could limit our ability to finance future operations_
and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest.
Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These
include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or
restrictions, in addition to being in default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes, we could be in default under the terms of the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, and the relevant bondholders and lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with
accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any
collateral securing that debt. This would also result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. If the debt under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees or any other material financing arrangement that we
enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Senior Secured Notes and our
other debt.

The Revolving Credit Facility also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy a specified financial maintenance test
in certain circumstances. The ability to meet this test could be affected by a deterioration in our operating results,
as well as by events beyond our control, including increases in raw materials prices and unfavorable economic
conditions, and we cannot assure you that this test will be met. If an event of default occurs under the Revolving
Credit Facility, the lenders thereunder could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under
other debt instruments, including the Senior Secured Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default
provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be
sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding, including the Senior
Secured Notes. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest_**
**_on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness._**

The French Finance Law for 2019 includes specific provisions which introduce into French tax legislation
the provisions of the ATAD regarding interest deductibility limitations in respect of fiscal years opened as from
January 1, 2019.

In relation to such introduction, (i) the provisions of (x) Articles 212 bis and 223 B bis of the French Tax
Code (i.e., the former 25% general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses (“rabot fiscal”)) and
(y) Article 209-IX of the French Tax Code (the “Amendement Carrez” limitation) have been repealed and (ii) the
provisions of Article 212-II of the French Tax Code (i.e., existing thin-capitalization rules) have been amended,
as developed in more detail below.

The other rules limiting interest deductibility remain unchanged, in particular (i) the rules relating to the
maximum rate for interest paid to direct minority shareholders or to related parties (Articles 39.1.3° and 212-I-(a)
of the French Tax Code); and (ii) the Anti Hybrid Loans Provisions as defined below (Article 212-I-(b) of the
French Tax Code).

Under Article 39.1.3° of the French Tax Code, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to
lenders who are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the
meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the

51


-----

borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate
equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of
two years (1.47% with respect to fiscal years closed on December 31, 2018). Non-deductible interest pursuant to
such limitation will be treated as deemed dividend under French tax law and may in particular be subject to
withholding tax, subject to applicable tax treaties. By exception, Article 212, I-(a) of the French Tax Code
provides that, in respect of a given tax year, interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the
meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the
French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent
financial credit institutions in similar circumstances.

Pursuant to Article 212 § I-(b) of the French Tax Code the deductibility of interest paid to a related party
within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is subject to an additional requirement: if the lender
is a related party to the borrower within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, the French
borrower shall demonstrate, at the French tax authorities’ request, that the lender is, for the current fiscal year
and with respect to the concerned interest, subject to an income tax in an amount that is at least equal to 25% of
the corporate income tax (increased by the French additional social contribution provided for by Article 235 ter
ZC of the French Tax Code) determined under standard French tax rules (the “Anti Hybrid Loans Provisions”).
Where the related-party lender is domiciled or established outside France, the corporate income tax determined
under standard French tax rules shall mean that to which it would have been liable in France on the interest
received if it had been domiciled or established in France.

In this respect, the ATAD 2, which amended the ATAD by, inter alia, extending the scope of the ATAD to
hybrid mismatches involving third countries, may impact the Anti Hybrid Loans Provisions. The ATAD 2 would
be applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions, which would be applicable only as
from January 1, 2022. The French Finance Law for 2019 does not include any particular modification of the
provisions of Article 212-I-(b) in order to introduce under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and such
modification should thus occur at a later stage.

Pursuant to Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-50, n° 230, dated August 5,
2014, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of Article 212 § I-b) of the French Tax Code is not to
be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Article 119 et seq. of the French Tax Code and,
therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code.

Pursuant to Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (codified under Article 212 bis of the French Tax
Code), the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is now
limited to the highest of (i) € 3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year
(corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into
consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses)
generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party
financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions.

Furthermore, for entities that are part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a
safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that
the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the
accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the
30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount.

French thin-capitalization rules have also been amended and apply cumulatively to the 30% Limitation, but
only to loans granted by related parties and no longer to third party debts guaranteed by related parties. In this
respect, where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5x the company’s
equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity will be deductible for a portion of their
amount up to the highest of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) € 3 million multiplied by a ratio equal to
(A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties within the meaning of
Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or
at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the
company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses will be deductible for a portion of their amount
up to the highest of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) € 1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the
average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12
of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing
date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company
during said fiscal year. Nevertheless, the interest deductibility restriction provided for by these amended

52


-----

thin-capitalization rules is not applicable if the borrowing company is able to demonstrate that the overall
debt-to-equity ratio of the group (as determined under accounting consolidation rules) to which it belongs is
higher than its own debt-to-equity ratio.

Financial expenses that are disallowed by virtue of the application of the 30% Limitation can be carried
forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion
disallowed as a result of the application of the 10% limitation will only be eligible for carryforward for one third
of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year might also be used over the
following five tax years, but only against financial expenses incurred in those fiscal years, it being noted that this
measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French
tax-consolidated groups.

The above-mentioned tax rules, as well as generally applicable tax principles, may limit the Group’s ability
to deduct interest accrued on the Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase
the Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations and reduce the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.

**_The liquidity of the market for the Senior Secured Notes may be diminished if the proposed financial_**
**_transactions tax or any similar tax were adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common
financial transactions tax (the “FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal,
Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if
enacted and implemented by France, would replace the French FTT. Following the ECOFIN Council meeting of
December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations.

The EU FTT could, if introduced in its current draft form, apply, under certain circumstances, to some
transactions involving the Senior Secured Notes and to persons both established within and outside the
Participating Member States. On October 10, 2016, the European Commission has been tasked with the drafting
of the legislation that will be submitted to the Participating Member States. However, and despite several
attempts, no agreement has been found between the Participating Member States so far. Recently, France and
Germany expressed their wish to adopt EU FTT that would be inspired by the French FTT. The ECOFIN
indicated on June 27, 2018 that Participating Member States are currently considering such proposal. However,
no final agreement has been reached yet.

The EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of
such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU
member states may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.
If the proposed directive or any similar taxes are adopted, such taxes could increase the transaction costs
associated with the purchases and sales of the Senior Secured Notes and could reduce liquidity in the market for
the Senior Secured Notes.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer will be required to offer
to repurchase all outstanding Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
not including, the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would
have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay
the purchase price of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to
make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or the acceleration
of, our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture and other
indebtedness. Furthermore, the repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a
default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive
cash from its respective subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, following
the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds

53


-----

may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of
control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Senior Secured Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the
purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any
Senior Secured Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control. We cannot assure you that we
would be able to obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes would constitute a default under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, which would, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control.”
The change of control provision contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate
events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a
“Change of Control” (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture).

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net senior
secured leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such an event.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture includes a disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise,
established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg_**
**_Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes or security interests in the Collateral._**

The Guarantors guarantee and provide security in respect of, and the Luxembourg Security Providers
provide security in respect of, the payment of the Senior Secured Notes on a senior basis. The Guarantors and the
Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of France and Luxembourg, respectively.
Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against the Guarantors or the enforcement of a security interest
in the Collateral will be subject to certain defenses available to the Guarantors or a Luxembourg Security
Provider in the relevant jurisdiction, as the case may be. Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, these laws
and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate
purpose or benefit, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no liability or
decreased liability under its Guarantee or the security interest in the Collateral may be void or may not be
enforceable depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the
enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of
the Guarantees against the Guarantors or security interest in the Collateral against any the Guarantor or any
Luxembourg Security Provider. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be declared_**
**_unenforceable against third parties under fraudulent conveyance laws._**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside bankruptcy
(the “action paulienne”). The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which the
person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for
any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and

54


-----

any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person by the
bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside
bankruptcy, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties under French law if: (i) the person
performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s
bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time
the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that
one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act
was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not
necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. See “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—_
_France.”_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes or under the Guarantees or security interests in_**
**_the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company that is organized and established under
the laws of France, and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are also organized under the laws of France,
and secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg
Security Providers (which are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg). In the event that any one or more of
the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, or any other grantor of security interests in the
Collateral, experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in
any of these jurisdictions. In addition, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation (as defined herein), the court
that shall have jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in relation to a debtor is the court of the
Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has its COMI. Therefore, to the extent that the COMI of
the Issuer or any Guarantor is deemed to be in a particular European jurisdiction, the courts of such jurisdiction
may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings with respect to it, irrespective of its jurisdiction of
incorporation. For a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the European Union and various
jurisdictions in the European Union, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity
_and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

Proceedings could also be initiated in France and Luxembourg to enforce your rights against the Collateral
located in those jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for
creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights.
There can also be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be favorable_**
**_to creditors, including investors in the Senior Secured Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights_**
**_under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are
organized and exist under the laws of France, and secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the
Guarantors, the Issuer and the Luxembourg Security Providers (which are incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg). In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in France
or Luxembourg. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of a Guarantor’s or the Issuer’s
jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-commencement interest and duration of the proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability
of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. The court
may also in certain circumstances void the security interest or the Guarantees where the debtor is close to or near
insolvency.

-----

In France, among other limitations, the granting of new security interests in the Collateral in connection
with Senior Secured Notes previously issued is subject to hardening periods, where certain arrangements or
disposals that are made during the “hardening period” (période suspecte) (a specified period preceding the court
decision commencing judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings) may be challenged by the receiver in
bankruptcy and certain creditors under applicable rules of avoidance. The applicable hardening period for these
new security interests in the Collateral will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit the security interests in the Collateral to be released
and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart the applicable hardening period. If
any security interest granted during the hardening period for debts previously incurred were sought to be
enforced, it would be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain insolvency
_law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security_
_interests—France—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation_
_proceedings.”_

In addition, in France, insolvency legislation tends to favor the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors. In the context of proceedings affecting creditors, including courtassisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)), and
court-administered proceedings (safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde
_financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation_
proceedings (liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to enforce their rights
under the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees could be limited or suspended.

Under French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by the Issuer, a Guarantor or
any relevant security provider, as the case may be, may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses
available to debtors under French law, as the case may be, in respect of the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of such security interest.

For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Issuer, the
Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations
_on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ or the
Luxembourg Security Providers’ jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these
laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply,
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the
Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—_
_Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.”_

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are entities organized under the laws of
France and Luxembourg with their registered offices or principal places of business in France and Luxembourg.
The directors, managers, officers and other executives of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security
Providers are neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, most of the assets of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers or directors, managers, officers and other executives of the
Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are located outside the United States. As a result,
it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce
against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process
within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The United States is not party to a treaty with France or Luxembourg providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in
France or in Luxembourg. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement
proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter.

56


-----

Enforcement in France or Luxembourg of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non
ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French or Luxembourg
court is satisfied that certain conditions have been met. For further information, see “Enforceability of
_judgments.”_

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to future hedging obligations (if any) and_**
**_future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with_**
**_recoveries from the enforcement of the Guarantee claims and proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral_**
**_in priority over the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions that govern the sharing of recoveries from guarantee
claims and proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such recoveries and enforcement proceeds are required
to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility. The Security Agent is required to pay turned-over amounts and other
recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions to discharge obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility or future hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness in priority to paying any such amounts to
discharge the Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or the enforcement of
the Guarantees, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving
Credit Facility or future hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness are greater than the proceeds
recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral or the enforcement of the Guarantees
will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and such hedging obligations and, if applicable
future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility have been discharged, be applied pro
rata in repayment of the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain restrictions with respect to the use of
proceeds from the sale of assets representing the Collateral prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit
Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement—Maturity
_and repayment requirements.”_

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior
Secured Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the
rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the securities account by judicial
or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public
auction.

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only secure a creditor
up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the
form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales))
may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged assets
in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of the judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte
_commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the_
legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a
judicial foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value
of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or
by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the collateral
exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount
(soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is
true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent
on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

Should a holder of the Senior Secured Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the
securities, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance

57


-----

with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the
vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition
of companies or groups of companies. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity
_and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—Limitations on enforcement of security_
_interests and cash amount (“soulte”).”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-priority security interests in
the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Senior
Secured Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to
realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety
of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or
recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the
Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities
or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any
such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon
those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees are secured on a contractually firstpriority basis with security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness and hedging obligations (the “Super Senior Liabilities”). The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance
with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and regulates the ability of
the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.
The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group
that consists of (i) creditors holding more than 66.67% of the indebtedness and commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain other indebtedness permitted to rank pari passu with the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement on the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral (a “Credit Facility”) and the certain
priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) the holders of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the
Senior Secured Notes and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured
Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that
time (the “Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor
representatives). However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been
fully discharged in cash within six months of such enforcement instructions first being issued or if Security
Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued
or certain insolvency events occur and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action, then the
enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail, provided in each case that
they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders may at any time (if the Security
Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) provide
immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/
Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any
transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall

58


-----

act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with
the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent,
provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event
that is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to the extent the
Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received Proposed
Enforcement Instructions (as defined herein) from the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security Agent
shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders until such time as a creditor representative acting on behalf of Majority Super Senior Creditors
issues enforcement instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such
prior instructions given by the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Notes, the voting interest of holders of Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted
commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured
Notes, the creditors of any other credit facility and the creditors in respect of certain priority hedging obligations
may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents
and other security interests over the Collateral at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the
Issuer or any of its holding companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing
the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of_
_Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents or other transaction
security, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Senior
Secured Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders
of the Senior Secured Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the
event of a default. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, and the_**
**_sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other
Collateral providers, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest
and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes to the extent that it relates to
their assets. So long as no enforcement event or acceleration event has occurred, the Issuer, the Guarantors and
the other Collateral providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent,
conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of
indebtedness.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Senior Secured Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

For a description of the security over the Collateral, see “Summary—The Offering—Security.” In the event
of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets
underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among others,
whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which operations are located, the availability of buyers and whether approvals

59


-----

required to purchase the business would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral, the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations will be
entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the holders of the pledges securing the
Senior Secured Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such distribution with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes.

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of
these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us.
Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will not be substantial
delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Secured Notes, and it is possible
that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such
Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and/or the
Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all the obligations of the entity
whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity.
As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in
the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured
indebtedness or third parties have liens on the Collateral, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and
remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such additional Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same
collateral as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit
from the liens on the Collateral. Although we will be subject, under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, to
certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness that will be secured by the Collateral, including
a Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (as defined
and described under “Description _of_ _the_ _Senior_ _Secured_ _Notes—Certain_ _covenants—Limitation_ _on_
_Indebtedness”), the definition of Senior Secured Indebtedness contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture_
(as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”) for the purposes of calculating the Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains certain important
exceptions and carve-outs.

**_The security over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured
Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees are not granted directly to the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes but have been granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Senior
Secured Indenture will provide and the Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the Security Agent and
Parallel Debt (as defined below) creditors have the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence,
holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.

Under French law the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such
security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of the
creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under
Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the
French Civil Code which came into force on 1st October 2017. The beneficial holders of interests in the Senior
Secured Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial
holders of the Senior Secured Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the
creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

60


-----

Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed
by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard
proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure
will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general
recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim.
There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French
law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders
of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interests in the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as
the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee will have certain assigned duties and rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that
become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in the interests of the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011_
n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, among others, the Trustee. To the extent that the
security interests in the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes created to the benefit of the Trustee are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to receive on
this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee.

See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees_ _and_ _the_ _security_ _interests—France—Parallel_ _debt—trust”_ and _“Certain_ _insolvency_ _law_
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—_
_France” and “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the security interests—Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.”_

**_Upon a Qualifying IPO, certain Collateral over, or granted by, the Luxembourg Security Providers will no_**
**_longer apply and will be released and the Senior Secured Notes and the remaining Collateral may be subject_**
**_to hardening and other risks._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake a Qualifying IPO (as defined under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain definitions”). In connection with a Qualifying IPO, the Collateral over, or granted_
by, the Luxembourg Security Providers will be released without the consent of the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes and certain covenants described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants” will
no longer apply, including:

   - “—Centre of main interest”;

   - “—Maintenance of Double Luxco structure”;

   - “—Limitation on the Sponsor SPVs”; and

   - “—Limitation on Liens” (with respect to any Luxembourg Security Providers).

A Qualifying IPO would also result in the release of any share pledges granted by the Luxembourg Security
Providers and, as such, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not be able to enforce any relevant security
interest in Luxembourg in order to control the Issuer and its subsidiaries and avoid safeguard or accelerated
safeguard proceedings that might be initiated by the Issuer’s management. See “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—_
_France.”_

61


-----

The Guarantors will remain Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes and be subject to the obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, Liens over any Collateral may be released and material
amendments may be made to any Security Document by the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes for the purpose of implementing a Qualifying IPO. Any substitution of obligors could be treated
for French law purposes as an exchange of the Senior Secured Notes for new notes. In such a case, new security
documents in respect of the permanent collateral that will remain in place following a Qualifying IPO may need
to be executed. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that such a substitution may not be void or voidable if it
occurred during a hardening period. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants—
_Disapplication of covenants and release of Liens on a Qualifying IPO.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as_**
**_security for the Senior Secured Notes._**

If there is an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, in the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, whether as a result of the creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in certain
circumstances, linked to our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to certain agreed
security principles. To the extent that lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are granted
security, the negative pledge in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may require, subject to local law limitations,
such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The agreed security
principles set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a number of limitations on the rights of
the lenders to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may
result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not
being granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security principles
may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security
Providers.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes exceed the value of the assets
securing the Senior Secured Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the
holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured
Notes. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the Senior Secured Notes is less than the value
of the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the
claims of certain unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The security interests in the Collateral
may not be perfected with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable, if we or the
Security Agent are not able to or do not take the actions that are necessary to perfect any such security interests.
Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or actions to perfect any of
these security interests. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Senior
Secured Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired
after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are
acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform
the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the
necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The
Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute
Collateral or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security
interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees against third parties. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—Rights in the Collateral may be adversely_
_affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.”_

Additionally, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not and the Security Documents entered into in
connection with the Senior Secured Notes do not require us to take a number of actions that might improve the
perfection or priority of the security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral. To the extent that the

62


-----

security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the Security
Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure,
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings.

**_The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes and the Existing_**
**_Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our_**
**_costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The loans outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (if any) and the Existing Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes bear interest and the Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at floating rates of
interest per annum equal to EURIBOR (and in respect of certain utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, LIBOR), as adjusted periodically (and, in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, a zero floor
applying to EURIBOR/LIBOR), plus a margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. We may
enter into certain interest rate hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates but are not required
to do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense
associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability
to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes or on our other debt instruments.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your_**
**_consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be
released automatically as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Release of Liens,”
including, but not limited to:

   - in the case of Collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition of property or assets
constituting Collateral (as applicable), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Limitation
_on sales of assets and subsidiary stock” covenant, described under “Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes” is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;_

   - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of the Guarantor; as
described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Amendments and waivers”;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, as provided under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Defeasance” and
_“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Satisfaction and discharge”;_

   - in respect of liens over or granted by any Luxembourg Security Provider, as described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants—Disapplication of covenants and
_release of Liens on a Qualifying IPO”;_

   - the property, assets and shares of a restricted subsidiary designated as an unrestricted subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

   - with respect to all or part of the structural security securing the Senior Secured Notes, as may be
permitted by the “Maintenance of Double LuxCo structure” covenant, as described under “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes”;_

   - in respect of the security provided by LuxCo 5 and LuxCo 6 securing the Senior Secured Notes, upon a
change of control; and

   - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless consented to and subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the Guarantees or
security interests in the Collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

   - for consideration, all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; and

   - pursuant to an auction or other competitive sale process, under the consultation of an internationally
recognized investment bank or accountancy firm which shall (save in certain circumstances) opine on
the consideration received by giving a fairness opinion.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Senior Secured Notes will entail
foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro
relative to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments because
of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the
currency by reference to which an investor measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease
in the effective yield of the Senior Secured Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to
investors when the return on the Senior Secured Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the
investor measures the return on his or her investments. Investments in the Senior Secured Notes by U.S. holders
(as defined in “Tax considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) may also have important
tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax considerations—Certain U.S.
_federal income tax considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Senior Secured Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Senior Secured Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the
rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit
rating assigned to the Senior Secured Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the
cost, terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Senior
Secured Notes.

**_Transfer of the Senior Secured Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes._**

Because the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will not be, and are not required to be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in
the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with
Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of
investors to resell the Senior Secured Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Senior Secured Notes to ensure
that all offers and sales of the Senior Secured Notes in the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws. For further information, see “Transfer restrictions.”

**_The Senior Secured Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined herein) will trade in book-entry form only, and Senior Secured
Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange
for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of Senior Secured Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Senior Secured Notes.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the
Senior Secured Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests
in the Global Notes representing the Senior Secured Notes and credited by such participants to indirect
participants. After payment to the Paying Agent, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment
of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a
book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they
own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture.

64


-----

Unlike the holders of the Senior Secured Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders
of the Senior Secured Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only
to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, unless
and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry
interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market in the Senior Secured Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Senior Secured Notes; or

   - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Senior Secured Notes.

Future trading prices of the Senior Secured Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading
market for the Senior Secured Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar
securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Senior Secured Notes. Any such disruption
may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Senior Secured Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance.

**_The Senior Secured Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although the Issuer has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Senior Secured Notes
listed on the Official List of the Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date and to maintain such
listing as long as the Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Senior Secured
Notes will become, or remain, listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the Exchange
or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain
such listing on the Official List of the Exchange, provided that it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and
maintain the listing of the Senior Secured Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance
that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Senior Secured
Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for
comparable issuers in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or
the delisting of the Senior Secured Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in
accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
resell Senior Secured Notes in the secondary market.

**_The Senior Secured Notes may be impacted by the Benchmarks Regulation_**

The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and other indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks”
are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of
these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such
benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which
cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any Senior Secured Notes
linked to such a “benchmark.”

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) was published in the Official Journal of the EU
on June 29, 2016, and applies since January 1, 2018. The Benchmarks Regulation applies to the provision of
benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark, within the EU. It will,
among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to
be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EU
supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not
deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed).

65


-----

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on any Senior Secured Notes in particular, if the
methodology or other terms of the EURIBOR benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements
of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing
or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the EURIBOR benchmark.

In addition, any of the international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased
regulatory scrutiny of “benchmarks,” could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise
participating in the setting of a “benchmark,” including the EURIBOR, and complying with any such regulations
or requirements.

Such factors may have the following effects on certain “benchmarks” such as the EURIBOR: (i) discourage
market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to such “benchmark”; (ii) trigger changes in the
rules or methodologies used in the “benchmarks” or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the “benchmark.” Any of
the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for
reform or other initiatives or investigations, could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on
any Senior Secured Notes linked to the EURIBOR benchmark.

Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential
risks imposed by the Benchmarks Regulation reforms, investigations and licensing issues in making any
investment decision with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

The potential elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of
EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Senior Secured Notes. Any such
consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such Senior Secured Notes.

Investors should be aware that, if EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest
on the Senior Secured Notes will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to
the Senior Secured Notes. Depending on the manner in which the EURIBOR benchmark is to be determined
under the terms and conditions, this may in certain circumstances (i) be reliant upon the provision by reference
banks of offered quotations for the EURIBOR benchmark which, depending on market circumstances, may not
be available at the relevant time or (ii) result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which
applied in the previous period when EURIBOR was available. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect
on the value or liquidity of, and return on, the Senior Secured Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes, assuming an issuance at par, will be
€175.0 million. We intend to use the gross proceeds from this Offering: (i) to fund the Existing Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes Redemption; (ii) to repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility;
(iii) for general corporate purposes; and (iv) to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
foregoing.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Refinancing are shown
in the table below, assuming that the Refinancing completes on or about the Issue Date. Actual amounts will vary
from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the issue price of the Senior Secured Notes,
accrued interest on debt being repaid and differences from our estimates of fees and expenses associated with the
Refinancing.

_Reporting,” the IFRS standard applicable to interim financial statements._

_Unless otherwise indicated, information presented in this discussion is presented on a consolidated basis._
_This discussion includes forward-looking statements which, although based on assumptions that we consider_
_reasonable, are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual events or conditions to differ_
_materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See “Forward-looking_
_statements” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us. You should also see “Risk factors.”_

_Unless otherwise indicated, the financial and operational data presented herein do not include Verviers_
_Freins and Oscaro._

**Overview**

We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux and Italy, with over 55 years of experience. Since
the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline) distributor
in the business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) segments. We
hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by our unique operational model and value-added
services proposition, our history of organic growth and value-accretive acquisition-led growth as well as our
strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, we generated revenue of €1,379.2
million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €128.2 million. After giving effect to the acquisitions of Verviers Freins and
Oscaro, we had a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €168.5 million for the twelve months ended September 30,
2018.

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017. We also hold
leading positions around the rest of Western Europe and, in 2017, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM
distributor in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands.

We have strengthened our leading position in France with the acquisition of Oscaro, the French leader in
online sales of light vehicle spare parts. Oscaro is one of the first online players to offer new spare parts from
manufacturers and wholesalers, generating the majority of its revenue from the B2C (DIY) segment. Oscaro
offers approximately 1 million SKUs and operates mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in other markets such
as Spain. We expect the acquisition of Oscaro to help develop our international presence online, as we intend to
roll sales platform to other countries in which we operate.

We operate in the French, Benelux and Italian independent aftermarkets. In recent years, we have grown
externally through strategic acquisitions to develop our international presence, such as with the acquisitions of
Doyen Auto in 2016, Geevers Auto Parts B.V. (“Geevers”) in May 2018 and Verviers Freins in October 2018 in
Benelux, and the acquisitions of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car in 2017 and Genfin S.r.l. and its subsidiaries
constituting the G-Group (“G-Group”) in June 2018 in Italy. We have also grown through strategic acquisitions
to expand our complementary product offerings, such as with the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise in 2017,
giving us access to the windscreen and window (“auto glass”) replacement market.

Our revenue grew from €914 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to €1.4 billion for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2018, with an average organic growth rate of approximately 3% per annum over the
period. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our Adjusted EBITDA was €67.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA
margin was 7.3%. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was €128.2 million and
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.3%.

**Key factors affecting our results of operations**

The following are key factors that have significantly affected our results of operations and financial
condition and liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018 and the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 or which we expect will significantly affect (or continue to affect) our results
of operations in the future.

**_Factors related to our industry_**

_Dynamics of the aftermarkets for spare parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair_

The following factors may affect the distribution aftermarkets in which we operate in any given period:

   - **Size of the car parc/truck fleet. The number of light vehicles and trucks on the road impacts the size**
of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles and trucks. The size of the car parc in Western
Europe has grown steadily at a CAGR of 1.0% between 2011 and 2016 and is expected to increase at a
CAGR of 0.8% between 2016 and 2018. Growth of the car parc is impacted by population size, the rate
at which new cars are introduced into circulation and the rate at which old cars are retired from the
road. The size of the truck fleet in France, our primary truck market, has remained more or less flat in
recent years and is expected to grow slightly at a CAGR of 0.1% between 2017 and 2022. Growth of
the truck fleet is impacted by the same factors as those impacting the car parc, plus general economic
factors which may result in an increase or decrease in the number of new registrations as a function of
demand for commercial shipping (which tends to increase during times of economic growth and
decrease during times of economic difficulty).

   - **Age and quality of the car parc/truck fleet. The average age of light vehicles and trucks in operation**
also has an impact on the distribution aftermarkets in which we operate. In the EU, the average age of
the light vehicle car parc has increased from approximately 9.6 years in 2011 to 11.0 years in 2016, a
trend which is expected to continue. In France, our largest market, the average age of the light vehicle
car parc has increased from approximately 8.0 years in 2007 to 9.2 years in 2017, and is expected to
increase to 9.3 years by 2022. In general, older vehicles require more repair and maintenance services
and spare parts than younger ones, and as a result, an increase in the age of the car parc and truck fleet
is expected to have a positive impact on our operations. The age of the car parc and truck fleet is
impacted by the sales price and production quality of new light vehicles and trucks because both high
sales prices and increasing production quality (which generally enables vehicles to run longer without
repair or replacement) generally leads owners and truck fleet managers to delay the purchase of new
light vehicles and trucks, respectively, which could lead to decreased demand in the short term for our
products and services, although such purchases would also increase the size of the car parc or truck
fleet, potentially stimulating demand for our products and services in the medium- to long-term.
Additionally, regulations may continue to evolve in connection with gas emissions, which may lead to
upgrades to the car parc overall.

   - **Miles travelled. Vehicles that are frequently used and driven for longer distances typically require**
more repair and maintenance services and replacement of spare parts than those that have traveled less.
The average annual mileage for light vehicles up to 20 years old in the EU has increased at a CAGR of
0.6% from 2011 to 2016 and is projected to continue to increase at the same rate for the period from
2016 to 2018. General economic conditions impact mileage, and government incentives that encourage
carpooling and the use of public transportation may also reduce miles travelled. The fleet mileage for
trucks in France is also expected to grow, mainly driven by the recovery in Europe of the
manufacturing and construction sectors and associated transportation needs.

   - **Job frequency. Our results are impacted by the frequency with which drivers and truck fleet operators**
seek repairs on their vehicles or require replacement parts. Higher job frequency benefits us because it
increases demand for the products that we distribute and the services we provide. A number of factors
affect job frequency. As the car parc and truck fleet age, the need for repairs and/or maintenance
increases, thus increasing job frequency. Likewise, increased average mileage of the car parc and truck
fleet tends to also translate into greater job frequency as parts reach the end of their useful lives sooner.
Finally, general economic conditions can also impact job frequency, as during an economic downturn,
drivers or truck fleet managers may postpone non-essential vehicle repairs and maintenance due to
their diminished spending power.

   - **Preference for independent garages over manufacturers’ dealers’ garages. We believe that the**
diminished spending power of consumers and the increasing age of the car parc and truck fleet have

72


-----

encouraged drivers and truck fleet managers to rely more on garages operating in the independent
segment, as opposed to the manufacturers’ dealers’ segment. On average, the IAM provides more
competitive pricing than the OES. Certain customers prefer, however, particularly during the warranty
coverage period, to have their light vehicle serviced in a manufacturer’s dealer’s garage, due to the link
between the manufacturers’ dealers’ garage and the original light vehicle manufacturer, despite current
EU regulations that allow customers to use independent garages without impacting their warranty.
Manufacturers’ dealers’ garages tend to use original vehicle manufacturer parts that generally have
higher prices than those offered by us.

   - **Diversity of the car parc. There are many brands and models of vehicles on the road in our**
geographic markets, each of which requires specific spare parts for repairs. Any increase in the variety
of spare parts would benefit large, integrated distributors such as us because we have the scale to stock
a wide variety of spare parts. As a result, we can serve as a one-stop-shop for our end-customers, who
increasingly require a wider range of products. This increase in brands and models of vehicles may
adversely affect manufacturers’ dealers’ distributors, which focus on single brands, and small-scale
IAM distributors, which are less able to offer a wide variety of spare parts. An increase in the variety of
brands and models of vehicles may lead to further consolidation among smaller IAM distributors,
thereby further benefiting established, large and integrated distributors such as us.

The factors described above have generally had a positive impact on our results for the periods under
review, and we believe have generally increased our ability to maintain stable earnings and cash flow.

_Technological trends in our industry_

Our results are impacted by evolving technical specifications and new technologies in our industry and our
ability to timely respond to such trends. Technological advancements in the light vehicle and truck market, such
as the increasing number of driver assistance systems, collision prevention systems, control devices and other
electronic components, have resulted in more complex and more expensive repair processes and related spare
parts. The increased use of technology in the manufacturing of light vehicles, trucks and their respective spare
parts has improved the quality and extended the lifespan of key light vehicle and truck components, such as
exhaust systems, tires, and brakes. These trends have adversely affected our operations in certain of our business
segments because light vehicle and truck spare parts tend to wear out less frequently, which in turn lengthens
maintenance service cycles, lowers job frequency and leads to lower demand for spare parts and repair services.

Furthermore, due to ongoing technological developments, independent garages need to acquire the
appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components and gain access to the training, tools, instruments
and parts that such technological developments demand. Failure by independent garages to do so may result in an
increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by manufacturers’ dealers’ garages with the
necessary technical expertise. Similarly, given the extended lifespan of spare parts, certain truck and light vehicle
manufacturers have extended their new warranties (in the case of light vehicles to eight years or more, as
compared to four to five years in the past) and provide long-term service programs to customers. Nevertheless, in
many cases, decreasing volumes have been offset by increased prices for technologically advanced spare parts
and complex repair services. In addition, certain technological advancements may require entire modules or
systems to be replaced in certain types of light vehicles, as opposed to discrete parts, thereby increasing
replacement costs and decreasing market shares for small garages.

_Competition_

We face competition in our markets from two principal types of market participants: OE distributors and
other IAM distributors. The OE segment typically specializes in light vehicles and trucks from newly purchased
to three-year-old vehicles, and captures a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties, as
well as a more limited share of repairs of light vehicles and trucks aged four years and older. Certain vehicle
manufacturers have, however, extended their new light vehicles warranties to up to eight years and now cover
longer-term maintenance and repairs. We also face direct competition from other IAM distributors, particularly
on the basis of operational efficiency and price.

We also compete against online light vehicle and truck spare parts retailers that mainly compete with us on
the basis of price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the Internet before
making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price. We realized at an early stage
that the Internet offered innovative opportunities for light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors. As a result,
we created the Autossimo online light vehicles repair and maintenance portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online

73


-----

truck repair and maintenance portal in 2001 in order to address the growing demand for ordering spare parts
online. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately €161 million of our revenue from sales of light
vehicle spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors was generated
from the sale of light vehicle spare parts through our online portal, Autossimo.

_General economic conditions_

Our business and the demand for certain products that we distribute are affected by general economic
conditions in the markets in which we operate. While our business and the IAM in Western Europe as a whole
have generally proven resilient during economic cycles, each of our business lines responds differently to general
economic conditions. Our light vehicle business line tends to demonstrate resilience during weaker general
economic conditions, as light vehicle owners switch to cheaper independent garages from manufacturers’
dealers’ garages, and the average age of the car parc increases, increasing demand for maintenance. This provides
our business with an element of counter-cyclicality, in spite of vehicle owners delaying repairs for a short period
of time. Our truck parts distribution business line shows a higher correlation with general economic cycles, with
miles driven by trucks, and therefore demand for truck parts, increasing as general economic conditions improve.
Our collision repair business tends not to be significantly affected by general economic cycles. In addition,
certain of our products, such as brake pads, belts and other critical parts, tend to exhibit inelastic demand, even
during difficult economic conditions, while more discretionary items, such as accessories for light vehicles and
trucks, tend to be impacted more by the economic climate.

_Regulation_

The market for the supply and distribution of spare parts is affected by regulatory changes in each of the
geographies in which we operate, including those that govern access to the spare parts aftermarket for IAM
distributors and those that seek to impact vehicle safety and other driver behaviors.

   - **Block Exemption Regulation: The market for the supply and distribution of light vehicle and truck**
spare parts and the provision of repair and maintenance services has been generally liberalized as a
result of EU regulations. Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 dated May 27, 2010 was adopted to promote
fair and effective competition among aftermarket players, vehicle manufacturers and authorized
repairers, by ensuring that aftermarket players have access to spare parts and technical information
relating to such spare parts. The current regulatory framework is favorable for IAM players such us,
because it provides for: (i) full access for independent light vehicle and truck spare parts manufacturers
and garages to the technical information needed to ensure effective competition within and between the
IAM and the OE aftermarket, (ii) customers’ rights to engage independent garages throughout the life
of the light vehicle with no warranty limitations, (iii) the unrestricted sale of light vehicle and truck
spare parts in the IAM and (iv) resellers’ rights to use private brands and logos for light vehicle and
truck spare parts sales.

   - **Traffic laws and policy: The overall market for collision repair in France has been affected by a**
decline in collisions as a result of the increased enforcement of and publicity surrounding traffic laws.
The French government recently announced a reduction in the national speed limit for non-controlled
access two-way thoroughfares from 90 kilometers per hour to 80 kilometers per hour, with the
intention of further reducing traffic collisions. We have, however, increased our market share in this
declining market by strengthening our relationships with car insurance companies, providing collision
parts at lower prices and improving our supply chain for the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision
repair. Likewise, regulations applicable to trucks are particularly stringent and apply high standards for
truck safety through periodic technical controls.

   - **CICE: In addition, our results are also impacted by government policies in France relating to payments**
for certain social charges, such as CICE. In December 2012, CICE, a tax credit for encouraging
competitiveness and jobs, was adopted as part of an overall stated French government policy to
improve the competitive position of companies in France. However, Article 86 of the French Finance
Law for 2018 (law 2017-1837 of December 30, 2017) abolished the CICE for salaries paid as from
January 1, 2019. This will result in the elimination of the positive impact of the CICE on our results of
operations. Another concurrently enacted law (law 2017-1836 of December 30, 2017) partly balanced
the elimination of the CICE by decreasing, under certain conditions, by six points the rate of one of the
employer’s social security contributions as from January 1, 2019. However, we cannot yet assure at
this stage that this decrease will effectively provide us with an advantage comparable to the benefit of

74

the CICE. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—Our business is subject to various laws
_and regulations, including in relation to labor and employment, and changes in, or violations of, such_
_laws or regulations may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition”_
for further information.

**_Factors specific to our business_**

_Operational improvement measures_

Our results are affected by operational improvement measures that we implement.

We have developed and continue to implement operating strategies designed to enhance profits. One of our
most important competitive advantages has been our ability to use the purchasing power we have derived from
our large size and our fully-integrated, automated warehouse and logistics systems. In recent years, we have
strategically reduced the number of suppliers we use, concentrating larger volumes of purchases among fewer
suppliers, which has enabled our CPU to negotiate better purchasing terms and conditions for the products that
we distribute. We have also streamlined our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and distribution network to get
products to our customers increasingly rapidly and cost effectively. As a result of these measures, we have
significantly improved our cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations from €31.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2015, to €103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our cash
conversion rate has also grown during the periods under review, from 73% in 2015 to 78% in 2017. We intend to
continue optimizing purchase conditions with our key suppliers. In addition, we intend to continue to integrate
our upstream supply chain to increase our margins.

_Distribution network and branded garages_

Our local distribution model includes wholly-owned distributors and independent affiliated distributors. We
had 34 wholly-owned distributors as of December 31, 2017. Conversions of wholly-owned distributors to
independent affiliated distributors, and vice-versa, may have an impact on our profitability and, in addition,
overhead costs are higher for administering the wholly-owned network of distributors as compared with the
network of independent affiliated distributors.

Additionally, if our network of distributors, including both wholly-owned and independent affiliated
distributors, were to shrink or expand, our revenue could be impacted. Similarly, many of our customers are
garages, some of which are branded garages. We had entered into agreements with 3,197 branded garages as of
December 31, 2017. Turnover in and maintenance or extension of our network of branded garages also has an
impact on revenue. For example, if our network of branded garages were to shrink, we might generate lower
revenue as a result. On the other hand, if our network of branded garages were to expand, it might generate
higher revenue.

**_Key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations_**

_Acquisitions and disposals_

We have historically pursued external growth through acquisitions in the past and intend to continue to seek
opportunities for acquisitions in the future. During the periods under review, we have successfully acquired a
number of businesses that are complementary to our existing operations, including:

   - In 2016, we acquired the Doyen Auto Group, a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles
with operations in France and Benelux, making it the number two light vehicle spare part distributor in
Belgium and the number four light vehicle spare part distributor in the Netherlands;

   - On March 22, 2017, we acquired Mondial Pare-Brise, a French windshield repair specialist, and a stake
in Grup Eina, a Spanish company specialized in offering digital technical support and data management
for vehicle repairmen;

   - In 2017, we formed a joint company, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., with three distributors of light
vehicle spare parts, OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto, making it the number two light vehicle spare part
distributor in Italy. Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. is a holding company and is a joint venture with certain
managers of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car. We hold 55% of the share capital and voting rights of
Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. and a call option for further shares of Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., which
may only be exercised starting from May 2020 and at a pre-agreed, fixed EBITDA acquisition
multiple;

75


-----

   - On March 1, 2018, we acquired additional interests in Sarco, increasing our ownership from 49% to
100%;

   - On March 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Société Française d’Industrie Automobile
(“SFIA”), a wholesale and retail light vehicle distributor in Epernay, in eastern France;

   - On May 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in GPR Auto, a wholesale and retail light vehicle
distributor in southern France;

   - On May 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Geevers, an independent distributor of light vehicle
spare parts in Benelux;

   - On May 31, 2018, OVAM acquired 100% interests in FGL Srl, an Italian distributor specialized in car
body parts and lightning;

   - On June 19, 2018, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. acquired 100% interests in G-Group, an independent
spare parts distributor in Italy; and

   - On July 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Vallespir Auto Diffusion S.à r.l., a wholesale and
retail vehicle spare parts distributor in southern France.

Furthermore, in 2017, we decided to exit the Polish market by divesting our Polish subsidiary, AD Polska,
to Rhiag Group. Following the disposal of AD Polska, it was classified as discontinued operations. In accordance
with IFRS 5, our consolidated income statements and cash flow statements for the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2016 have been restated to exclude the impact of the disposed business. In our consolidated income
statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, AD Polska’s net result is shown in the
caption “Discontinued Operations.” In our consolidated cash flow statements for the years ended December 31,
2015, 2016 and 2017, AD Polska’s cash flows from operations, investing and financing activities are shown in
separate lines as discontinued operations. For further information see “Presentation of financial information and
_other data—Restatements.”_

These acquisitions have affected our results, and limit the comparability of our results from period to period.
These acquisitions as well as potential future acquisitions and disposals will continue to impact our results. Our
acquisitions of Verviers Freins and of Oscaro that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, will affect our
results going forward. By further participating in the industry-wide consolidation of our markets and integrating
acquired entities into the Group, we believe that we can increase the purchasing power of our CPUs to negotiate
better contractual terms with suppliers, thereby improving our margins. We believe we are well positioned to be
a natural consolidator in the fragmented markets in which we operate, and we intend to continue to selectively
pursue acquisitions to further expand our network in order to increase our market share and purchasing power, as
well as, realize other economies of scale.

_IFRS 9—Financial instruments_

We adopted IFRS 9 on January 1, 2018, prospectively. The comparative periods presented have not been
restated to reflect the potential impact. Under IFRS 9, we applied the simplified approach permitted thereby,
which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized at the initial recognition of the receivables. For
receivables of our major customers, a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses is recognized based on each
customer’s credit ratings. For other receivables, a portfolio approach is applied to the extent they have similar
credit risk characteristics and provision is recognized according to certain criteria based on days past due of the
receivables and actual historical default rates. The impact of the first adoption of IFRS 9 on our consolidated
statement of financial position as of January 1, 2018, is described in note 5.4 to the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2018.

**Explanation of key income statement line items**

The following is a brief description of the revenue and expenses that are included in the line items of our
income statement.

76


-----

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service
to the customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset. The revenue can be
broken down as follows:

   - _Sales revenue through our logistics platforms: We operate a distribution of spare parts for light_
vehicles and trucks, based on a highly sophisticated distribution system that requires significant
investments in logistics.

   - _Direct flow sales commission: We also sell spare parts, equipment and tools that are delivered directly_
by suppliers to independent distributors and do not pass through our logistics platforms. When such
third party suppliers other than us are involved in providing goods to a customer, we assess whether the
nature of our promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods itself
or to arrange for the suppliers to provide those goods or services. We are considered an agent if our
performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods by the suppliers and revenue is
recognized for the amount of any commission to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for
arranging for the suppliers to provide our goods. The commission revenue recognized corresponds to
the difference between the consideration received from the customer less the consideration due to the
supplier that provided the goods. Where direct delivery is made by suppliers to independent
distributors, we are invoiced by suppliers and then invoices such distributors. Related payment flows
are processed by us.

**_Cost of goods sold_**

Cost of goods sold includes purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories and net allocation to
inventories depreciation.

**_Personnel costs_**

Personnel costs include wages, social security contributions, profit-sharing plans and pension costs. Pension
costs include the allocation to provisions for retirement benefits for the year as well as the reversal of provisions
as a result of benefits paid during the year. Personnel costs also include the CICE and the “Fillon” tax reduction,
which are deducted from personnel costs.

**_External expenses_**

External expenses relate to non-direct operating costs, including rental expenses, shipping expenses,
maintenance and repair costs, legal and other fees, IT expenses, advertising expenses, subcontracting costs,
travelling and other expenses.

**_Taxes other than income taxes_**

Taxes other than income taxes include taxes on salaries (mainly taxes in respect of vocational training), the
social construction tax (Participation à l’effort de construction), the real estate business contribution (Cotisation
_foncière des entreprises), the social solidarity contribution (Contribution sociale de solidarité des sociétés, a tax_
calculated based on a percentage of revenue) and other taxes other than income tax.

**_Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses include other items related to our ordinary activities, such as losses
for doubtful accounts and service fees related to B2B websites for electronic catalogues, and commissions paid
and received as part of the service connecting insurers and vehicle repairers.

**_Depreciation/amortization expenses_**

Depreciation expenses represent the depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Amortization relates to
intangible assets, excluding goodwill and brands, such as AD. Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives.

**_Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations generally relate to one-off events or other events outside
ordinary business. Other income and expenses from operations can include gains and losses on the disposal of

operations, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as costs relating to provisions and
expenses relating to significant and unusual restructuring, employee and tax disputes and impairment losses/
reversals on goodwill and brands, including AD and costs related to major acquisitions and to our previously
contemplated initial public offering.

**_Financial income and expenses_**

Financial income includes income from financial investments, foreign exchange gains and other financial
income. Financial expenses include interest on external loans and bank overdrafts payable by us, discounting of
borrowings and debt, expenses related to financial instruments and to finance leases, foreign exchange losses and
other financial expenses.

**_Income tax_**

Income taxes consist of current tax expense, CVAE (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises) and
changes in deferred tax assets.

**Description of other key financial indicators**

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses adjusted for certain items that we consider to be non-recurring or exceptional in nature, or
otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business. See the table set forth in “Summary—
_Summary consolidated financial and other information” for a reconciliation of operating income from ordinary_
activities and Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss) from continuing operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 and 2018, and the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2017.

**Restatements**

**_IFRS 15—Revenue recognition_**

We elected to early adopt IFRS 15 as of January 1, 2017, relating to revenue recognition from contracts with
customers, using the full retrospective method, which requires restatement of each prior reporting period
presented. We applied this full retrospective method to restate our financial statements for the two years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2016. The most significant impact of the IFRS 15 standard relates to the sales of spare
parts, equipment and tools delivered directly by suppliers to independent distributors that do not transit through
our logistics platforms as they are directly delivered by suppliers to independent distributors (referred to as direct
sales transactions). Historically under IAS 18 we bear the inventory and credit risks of these products and
therefore are considered a principal in these transactions. Under IFRS 15, the guidance focuses on the transfer of
control of the products rather than the risks and, accordingly, we are considered an agent, rather than the
principal in those transactions. Therefore for the direct sales transactions, only the net amount that we retain as a
commission is recognized as revenue. This accounting better reflects our strategy to focus on transactions
involving our logistics platforms rather than direct flow transactions which do not pass through our platforms.
The IFRS 15 impacts that we have identified are mainly driven by the new principal versus agent application
guidance as explained above.

The adoption of IFRS 15 resulted in a reversal of cost of goods sold for purchase of goods from the
suppliers and a corresponding reversal of revenue previously recognized for direct sales to distributors for the
same amount. The remaining revenue represents the commission we earned for direct sales transactions,
including discounts received from suppliers and discounts given to the distributors. The adoption therefore had
no impact on our EBITDA or operating income in any reporting period and had no impact on the consolidated
reserves as of January 1, 2017. Adoption of the standard also did not impact the assets and liabilities on the
consolidated statement of financial position nor cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. Restatements to the previously reported results due to the adoption of the
new standard on our consolidated income statements are described in note 4 to the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, included in
this Offering Memorandum.

**_IFRS 5—Discontinued operations_**

On August 4, 2017, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our subsidiary in Poland, AD Polska. AD
Polska was classified as discontinued operations in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and in the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2017. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, our consolidated income
statements for years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 have been restated to exclude the impact of the disposed
business. Restatements to the previously reported results due to discontinued operations on our consolidated
income statements are described in note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent
Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 included in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Segment reporting**

Throughout this Offering Memorandum, we present our financial results by segment. These segments
correspond to the Parent Guarantor’s reporting segments in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments.” Our
operating segments consist of the following:

of which Light Vehicle International . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 170.4 258.2 87.8 51.5%

Revenue increased by €124.4 million, or 13.4%, from €930.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, to €1,055.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to the
expansion of operations through acquisitions in France, Benelux and Italy.

   - Light Vehicle France: Light Vehicle France revenue increased by €29.3 million, or 4.5%, from
€644.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to €673.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to (i) the full impact of the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise
on March 22, 2017, (ii) the acquisition in 2018 of SFIA, GPR Auto and Vallespir Auto Diffusion S.à
r.l, which generated €1.5 million of revenue since their respective acquisition dates and (iii) organic
growth generated by gains in market shares mainly as a result of increased revenue from Affiliated
Distributors and an increase in our CPU revenue due to a larger product offering made available
through our new automated Logisteo platform (mechanical parts, painting and equipment), which
allows us to recognize the full amount of revenue, as we sell directly to customers rather than through
our distributors.

   - Trucks: Trucks revenue increased by €7.3 million, or 6.3%, from €116.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017, to €123.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly

81


-----

due to (i) organic growth following the ongoing implementation of a new distribution model and
business re-organizational measures at the Group level; and (ii) the addition of new AD Poids Lourds
workshops generating additional sales.

   - Light Vehicle International: Light Vehicle International revenue increased by €87.8 million, or 51.5%,
from €170.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to €258.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to the full-period effect of the acquisitions of Italian
distributors (OVAM, Ricauto and Topcar) in 2017 and the acquisitions of Geevers and G-Group in
2018.

_Cost of goods sold_

Cost of goods sold increased by €83.1 million, or 16.1%, from €516.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, to €599.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to higher
sales volume as a result of both acquisitions and organic growth. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold
increased from 55.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to 56.8% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018. This slight increase as a percentage of revenue was mainly due to a time lag in realizing
purchasing synergies from the recent acquisitions and the lower gross margins from the recently acquired Italian
businesses (taking into account the full-period impact from acquisitions completed in 2017 and the contribution
of acquisitions completed in 2018), partly offset by the full-period impact of Mondial Pare-Brise’s purchasing
synergies.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €16.2 million, or 8.0%, from €203.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, to €219.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to the
integration of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, Mondial Pare-Brise, G-Group and Geevers.

As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs decreased from 21.8% for the nine months ended September 30,
2017, to 20.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to (i) our productivity
improvements; and (ii) the effect of the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and G-Group in Italy, which have
a lower personnel cost base than the Group’s average.

_External expenses_

External expenses increased by €15.1 million, or 12.3%, from €122.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, to €137.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to the effects
of (i) higher advertising expenses, which increased by €3.7 million between the relevant periods due to one-off
expenses related to a large-scale AD network conference held in September 2018 and (ii) higher transportation
costs, which increased by €3.9 million, between the relevant periods, as a result of higher activity, increasing fuel
costs and increasing cost of the transportation service companies. As a percentage of revenue, external expenses
slightly decreased from 13.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to 13.0% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018. This decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to (i) the effect of the
acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, and G-Group in Italy as well as Geevers, which have a lower external
expense cost base than the Group’s average; and (ii) our efforts to monitor and control external costs.

_Taxes other than income taxes_

Taxes other than income taxes remained stable at €9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2017, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income decreased by €1.6 million, or 50.0%, from €3.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, to €1.6 million for the nine months period ended September 30, 2018.

Amortization expenses on customer relationships of acquired companies, which are accounted as intangible
assets, increased by €2.8 million, from €4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to
€7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly impacted by the amortization of the
customer relationships of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, Mondial Pare-Brise and G-Group in the context of the
business combinations.

Amortization expenses on other intangible assets increased by €1.5 million, or 31.9%, from €4.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to €6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and
property, plant and equipment depreciation expenses increased by €0.6 million, or 4.8%, from €12.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to €13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018,
mainly due to the effect of the acquisitions of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and G-Group which increased the amount
of depreciation and amortization expenses.

_Operating income from ordinary activities_

As a result of the factors described above, our operating income from ordinary activities improved by
€3.5 million, or 5.7%, from €61.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to €64.7 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by €10.2 million, or 11.3%, from €90.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017, to €100.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to an
increase in Adjusted EBITDA in our Light Vehicle France and Light Vehicle International segments and, to a
lesser extent, on Trucks segment.

   - Light Vehicle France: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle France segment increased by
€2.3 million, or 2.7%, from €84.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to
€86.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to (i) the full effect of the
acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise which contributed €5.1 million to the Light Vehicle France Adjusted
EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to €3.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017; and (ii) continuous improvement of purchasing conditions through the
CPUs, combined with productivity gains generated by our new automated warehouse Logisteo. As a

83


-----

percentage of revenue, the Light Vehicle France Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 20 basis points
between the relevant periods, primarily due to a higher loyalty bonus paid in 2018 and increasingly
competitive market conditions.

   - Trucks: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Trucks segment increased by €1.8 million, from €0.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to €2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2018.

   - Light Vehicle International: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle International segment
increased by €6.0 million, or 42.3%, from €14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2017, to €20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. This increase was due to (i) the
acquisitions of OVAM, Ricauto, Top Car, G-Group and Geevers including purchasing synergies; and
(ii) the performance of Doyen Auto, including purchasing synergies. As a percentage of revenue, the
Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle International segment increased by 40 basis points, from 1.5%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to 1.9% for the nine months ended September 30,
2018, due to purchasing synergies.

   - Headquarters: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Headquarters increased by €0.2 million, or 2.2%, from a
negative €9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to a negative €8.8 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018, reflecting our decision to strengthen our central functions to
support our development.

_Other income from operations_

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, other
income from operations was nil.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €4.3 million, or 54.4%, from €7.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017, to €12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to (i)
€8.2 million costs related to our then contemplated initial public offering, including financial consulting costs as
incurred up to date; and (ii) an increase in IT transformation costs, from €0.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 to €2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. This increase was partly
offset by (i) the one-off costs related to the implementation of the new Logisteo platform in Réau for the nine
months ended September 30, 2017, which amounted to €3.5 million, and (ii) a decrease in fees related to
acquisitions, from €3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to €1.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018.

September 30, 2017, to €32.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to higher
interest costs related to the additional €80.0 million Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes issued in April
2017 and additional €175.0 million Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes issued in July 2018, the
depreciation in Oscaro’s shares of €5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, and higher
financial income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, due to the gain on disposal of AD Polska.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes increased by €1.2 million, from €4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017,
to €6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to lower deferred tax variance. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2018, income taxes comprised CVAE of €3.9 million (compared to

2017, and nine months ended September 30, 2018, since AD Polska was disposed of in August 2017.

_Net income_

As a result of the factors described above, our net income decreased by €14.7 million, or 51.1%, from a net
income of €28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to a net income of €14.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Revenue increased by €235.1 million, or 23.1%, from €1,019.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, to €1,254.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the OVAM, Ricauto, Topcar
and Doyen Auto acquisitions, reflected in our Light Vehicle International segment.

   - Light Vehicle France: Light Vehicle France revenue increased by €31.4 million, or 3.8%, from
€823.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €855.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise on March 22, 2017
which contributed, from the date of acquisition to the end of 2017, €21.9 million to our revenue; (ii) the
increase in revenue of the ACR (including Automax acquired in February 2016) platform by
€12.7 million, or 15.2%, driven by organic growth with web dealers, and the continuous effect of
marketing actions and loyalty programs that were launched with wholesalers, which had a favorable
effect on our business activity; (iii) the increase in our CPU revenue increase by €11.5 million, or
18.4%, driven by activity with Affiliated Distributors, mainly due to a better loyalty rate and an
increase in sales volumes, and the progressive ramp-up of sales of our private label ISOTECH sales;
and (iv) the increase in revenue generated by our Cora platform, €3.7 million, or 8.1%, supported by
continued growth of the windscreen sales, and sustained body parts sales. This increase was partially
offset by a decrease of organic sales by a limited subset of wholly-owned distributors due to
operational difficulties that we are currently addressing through our transformation plan.

   - Trucks: Trucks revenue increased by €2.3 million, or 1.5%, from €155.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €157.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) the
improved performance of our wholly-owned subsidiaries; and (ii) the acquisition of Bisensang in
March 2017 which, for the year ended December 31, 2017, contributed €4.7 million to our revenue.
This increase was partially offset by the closure and sale of six integrated workshops in 2017.

   - Light Vehicle International: Light Vehicle International revenue increased by €201.4 million from
€40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €242.1 million the year ended December 31,
2017, primarily due to (i) the full year impact of Doyen Auto for the year ended December 31, 2017,
compared to only one quarter impact for the year ended December 31, 2016, as we completed the
acquisition in September 2016, resulting in €127.7 million additional revenue for the year ended
December 2017; (ii) the acquisition by Doyen Auto of AD Belux in April 2017, and API Marne et
Aube (two auto parts distributors located in Eastern France) in March 2017, which overall contributed
€4.0 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017; and (iii) the acquisition of a stake in
three Italian distributors, OVAM, Topcar and Ricauto, in May 2017 to become Autodis Italia Holding
S.r.l., contributing €71.4 million to our revenue.

_Cost of goods sold_

Cost of goods sold increased by €146.3 million, or 26.4%, from €553.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €699.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the integration of
OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and Mondial Pare-Brise. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from
54.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 55.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase as
percentage of revenue was mainly due to the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, which had a higher cost
structure than the Group’s average, as the synergies did not have an impact in 2017, partially offset by the
synergies realized in 2017 following the acquisition of Doyen Auto in September 2016.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €35.7 million, or 14.9%, from €240.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, to €276.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) severance costs in connection
with the restructuring of our Light Vehicle France and Trucks segments, as part of our transformation plan;
(ii) an increase in temporary employment expenses of €4.3 million between the year ended December 31, 2016,
and the year ended December 31, 2017, partially driven by the one-off costs of the implementation of the new
Logisteo platform; and (iii) the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and Mondial Pare-Brise.

As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs decreased from 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016,
to 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to
(i) continuing management efforts to rationalize personnel costs over the period, (ii) the full year effect of the
acquisition of Doyen Auto, which had a lower personnel cost base than the Group’s average, (iii) the
predominantly fixed cost structure of personnel costs in the context of an increase in organic revenue and (iv) the
effect of the CICE, the rate of which increased from 6% to 7% between the year ended December 31, 2016, and
the year ended December 31, 2017, leading to a favorable impact of €1.5 million.

_External expenses_

External expenses increased by €30.2 million, or 22.2%, from €136.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €166.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) the acquisitions
of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and Mondial Pare-Brise, as well as the full year effect of the acquisition of Doyen
Auto; (ii) costs related to the implementation of our transformation plan, such as legal fees, restructuring costs,
including early rent termination costs in connection with site closures, or advisory costs related to the financial
and capital transformation of the Group; and (iii) the costs related to the implementation of the new platform
Logisteo, mainly consisting of rental expenses.

However, as a percentage of revenue, external expenses remained stable, representing 13.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2016, and 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to the full year effect
of Doyen Auto, which has a relatively lower percentage of external expenses to revenue.

_Taxes other than income taxes_

Taxes other than income taxes increased by €2.9 million, or 35.4%, from €8.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to the increase in the
amount of French vocational training tax, social construction tax and social solidarity contributions.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income and expenses increased by €0.6 million, or 12.2%, from an income of €4.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2016, to an income of €5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
mainly due to an increase in the commissions received from affiliated garages as part of the service connecting
insurers and vehicle repairers, partly offset by a decrease of the gain on disposals of fixed assets, arising from the
sale of APS Berwald in January 2016, which resulted in a €3.5 million disposal gain for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

Amortization expenses on customer relationships of acquired companies increased by €5.6 million, from
€1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
mainly impacted by the amortization of the customer relationships of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and Mondial
Pare-Brise, and AD Belux that was acquired by Doyen Auto.

Amortization expenses on other intangible assets increased by €1.7 million, or 33.3%, from €5.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2016, to €6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and property, plant and
equipment depreciation expenses increased by €4.0 million, or 32.0%, from €12.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to the effect of the
acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and Mondial Pare-Brise, as well as the full year effect of the acquisition
of Doyen Auto which increased the amount of depreciation and amortization expenses.

_Operating income from ordinary activities_

As a result of the factors described above, our operating income from ordinary activities increased by
€9.4 million, or 13.7%, from €68.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €77.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €25.4 million, or 27.4%, from €92.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to improvements in
our Light Vehicle France and Light Vehicle International segments, as described below.

   - Light Vehicle France: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle France segment increased by
€9.5 million, or 9.4%, from €101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €110.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) continuous improvements of purchasing
conditions through the CPUs, combined with a more integrated supply chain leading to margin
improvements, especially with our new automated logistics platform Logisteo; and (ii) the acquisition
of Mondial Pare-Brise in March 2017 which contributed €3.6 million to our Adjusted EBITDA, from
the date of acquisition to December 31, 2017. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Light Vehicle
France segment increased from 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 9.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2017 which, in the context of gains in market share, reflects the impact of the
rationalization of the distribution network and productivity gains over the period.

   - Trucks: The Adjusted EBITDA of our Trucks segment increased by €1.6 million, from €(0.0) million
for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the
Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Trucks segment increased from 0.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to 1.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, in each case due to the
implementation of the transformation plan for our Trucks segment, partly offset by the dilutive effect
of the acquisition of Bisensang.

   - Light Vehicle International: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle International segment
increased by €16.0 million, from €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €17.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Light Vehicle
International segment increased from 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016, to 7.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2017, due to (i) the full year impact of Doyen Auto for the year ended
December 31, 2017, compared to only one quarter impact for the year ended December 31, 2016 (as
the acquisition was settled in September 2016) and the impact of the acquisitions of AD Belux and API
Marne et Aube (two auto parts international networks located in Eastern France) by Doyen Auto in
2017; and (ii) the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar and Ricauto in May 2017.

   - Headquarters: The Adjusted EBITDA of our Headquarters segment decreased by €1.7 million, or
16.7%, from €(10.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to €(11.9) million for the year
ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) the change of criteria used for slow moving inventory
valuation, resulting in a one-off reversal (non-cash) of depreciation in 2016 at the Group level; and
(ii) a cost increase (relatively limited in the context of the Group’s development, due to our control of
central costs).

Other income from operations decreased by €19.7 million, or 96.6%, from €20.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to (i) the reversal of an

impairment of the Autodistribution brand, which resulted in a one-off gain of €12.9 million. An impairment tests
is carried out each year. It was assessed that the Autodistribution brand had regained popularity and that the
impairment had to be reversed. As of December 31, 2016, the impairment was fully reversed in 2016; (ii) gains
on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of €4.8 million, related to APS Berwald
business and the sale of distribution sites; (iii) a €1.5 million gain following the final settlement of a dispute
related to the acquisition of Finelist in the 1990s; and (iv) the reversal of a provision for risks of €1.2 million.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €3.5 million, from €9.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) acquisition fees
related to the acquisitions OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and Mondial Pare-Brise; (ii) a one-off service cost of
€2.7 million related to the alignment of the collective pension agreement of certain subsidiaries to our collective
agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017; (iii) costs incurred during the implementation of our new
automated light vehicle logistics platform; and (iv) IT costs related to our IT transformation plan. This increase
was partly offset other expenses from operations incurred in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we
recorded a goodwill impairment of our Trucks segment of €2.1 million as a result of the negative performance of
the product line relating to truck parts for maintenance and repairs. There was no such impairment for year ended
December 31, 2017.

Net financial expense decreased by €11.7 million, from €38.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, to €26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to: (i) the write-off of €8.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2016, of capitalized issuance fees (non-cash), following the refinancing in
November 2016, as compared to €2.4 million of amortization of issuance costs of the Existing Senior Secured
Notes for the year ended December 31, 2017; (ii) the €8.7 million redemption premium paid in 2016 to holders of
the 6.5% senior secured notes due 2019 issued by the Issuer; and (iii) a €3.4 million gain in financial fixed assets
disposal related to the disposal of AD Polska in 2017. This decrease was partly offset by a higher level of interest
due to the full year impact of the 2016 refinancing.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes amounted to a €6.0 million tax credit for the year ended December 31, 2016, and a
€5.4 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income
taxes comprised CVAE of €5.6 million (compared to €5.8 million in for the year ended December 31, 2016), a
current income tax expense of €3.9 million (compared to a €1.3 million current income tax credit for the year
ended December 31, 2016) and a deferred tax credit of €4.0 million (compared to a deferred tax credit of
€10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016). This €6.6 million decrease in deferred taxes was mainly
due to the acquisition of Doyen Auto in September 2016, which enabled us to consume reportable deficits faster
than expected over the following years. For the year ended December 31, 2017, OVAM, Topcar and Ricauto
were not part of the tax integration and could therefore not contribute to reportable deficits consumption.

_Net income from discontinued operations_

Net income from discontinued operations decreased by €1.7 million, from €0.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, to €(1.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and relates to AD Polska.

_Net income_

As a result of the factors described above, our net income decreased by €15.5 million, or 33.1%, from a net
income of €46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to a net income of €31.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

Revenue increased by €51.1 million, or 5.3%, from €968.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015,
to €1,019.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

   - Light Vehicle France: Light Vehicle France revenue increased by €15.1 million, or 1.9%, from
€808.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to €823.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, primarily due to (i) the good performance of our Cora platform, whose revenue
increased by €6.5 million, or 16.7%, supported by continued growth of the windscreen activity; (ii) the
increase in revenue of our ACR platform of €3.4 million, or 4.7%, especially driven by web dealers and
new significant contracts with key accounts. Furthermore, marketing actions and loyalty programs
were launched with wholesalers, which had a favorable effect on the activity; (iii) the increase in
revenue from CPUs of €15.3 million, or 32.5%, driven by activity with Affiliated Distributors, mainly
due to a better loyalty rate and an increase in sales volumes; and (iv) the acquisition of Automax by
ACR in February 2016, which contributed €7.8 million to our consolidated revenue in 2016. This
overall increase was partially offset by (i) the €19.5 million decrease in external revenue following the
disposal of APS Berwald, a former wholly-owned distributor of spare parts for light vehicles that was

90


-----

sold to an affiliated independent distributor in January 2016. This decrease was partly compensated by
the recognition as external of the CPUs revenue to this newly affiliated independent distributor, which
is no longer eliminated at consolidation level; and (ii) a €4.8 million decrease, or 7.9%, of the whollyowned distributor Gobillot Rhône revenue, which was being reorganized.

   - Trucks: Trucks revenue decreased by €4.7 million, or 2.9%, from €160.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, mainly due to
challenging market conditions following the decrease in new registrations since 2009. This decrease
was partially offset by the acquisition of EDS in July 2016, which contributed to €2.7 million revenue
in 2016.

   - Light Vehicle International: Light Vehicle International revenue increased by €40.7 million between
the year ended December 31, 2015, and the year ended December 31, 2016, solely due to the
acquisition of Doyen Auto in September 2016.

_Cost of goods sold_

Cost of goods sold increased by €34.4 million, or 6.6%, from €518.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €553.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the acquisition of Doyen
Auto, partially offset by the disposal of APS Berwald.

As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 53.7% for the year ended December 31,
2015, to 54.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase as a percentage of revenue was mainly due
to: (i) Doyen Auto’s lower historical margin, in line with what was anticipated at the time of the acquisition since
the effects of synergies were not yet observed in 2016, and due to Doyen Auto’s clients mix, which is mainly
composed of key accounts and wholesalers; and (ii) price pressure at ACR and Cora, as well as in the Trucks
segment, given the high level of competition in the industry in this period. This increase was partially offset by:
(i) the positive effect of the improvement in inventory turnover, following reduction plans in our subsidiaries and
a change in inventory depreciation criteria. In 2016, all distributors were required to reduce inventories for costsavings purposes in the context of the ramp-up of the platforms. In addition, we did an analysis our methodology
of depreciation of slow moving inventories, leading to a positive impact; and (ii) a higher level of supplier
rebates thanks to synergies following the Automax acquisition.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs were relatively stable for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and were impacted
by the counter effects of the acquisition of Doyen Auto and the disposal of APS Berwal in 2016. As a percentage
of revenue, personnel costs decreased from 24.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 23.6% for the year
ended December 31, 2016. This decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to: (i) management efforts
to rationalize personnel costs over the period; (ii) the predominantly fixed cost structure of the personnel costs in
the context of an increase in organic revenue; and (iii) the Doyen Auto Acquisition, which had lower personnel
base cost than the Group’s average.

_External expenses_

External expenses increased by €12.0 million, or 9.7%, from €124.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €136.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the acquisition of Doyen
Auto, partially offset by the disposal of APS Berwald.

As a percentage of revenue, external expenses increased from 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015,
to 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to (i) the increase in shipping expenses of
€6.1 million, or 16.8%, between 2015 and 2016, mainly driven by the increase of Cora transportation costs due to
the development of the windscreen activity, which involves the use of specific transportation companies with
more expensive services. Furthermore, we had to deal with an increase in rates from carriers; (ii) an increase in
fees of €6.1 million, or 87.1%, related to the implementation of our transformation plan, such as legal fees,
restructuring costs or advisory costs related to the financial and capital transformation of the Group, and an
increase of sponsor fees following the latest leveraged buy-out of the Group; (iii) an increase in subcontracting
costs of €1.3 million, or 30.2%, driven by the new Logisteo platform, which contributed €1.0 million to the
increase in subcontracting costs between 2015 and 2016; and (iv) an increase in IT expenses of €1.2 million, or
16.0%. This change was partially offset by a €1.4 million net decrease, or 25.9%, in advertising expenses.
Advertising campaigns, especially on television, were launched in 2016, but most of the costs incurred were
passed on to distributors.

_Taxes other than income taxes_

Taxes other than income taxes decreased by €0.7 million, or 7.9%, from €8.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31,
2016, taxes other than income taxes consisted primarily of a French vocational training tax of €3.3 million
(compared to €3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015), a social construction tax of €2.0 million
(compared to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015) and a social solidarity contribution of
€1.4 million (compared to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015).

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income and expenses increased by €1.5 million, or 44.1%, from an income of €3.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2015, to an income of €4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This
increase reflects our activity over the period.

equipment depreciation expenses increased by €0.8 million, or 6.8%, from €11.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

_Operating income from ordinary activities_

As a result of the factors described above, our operating income from ordinary activities improved by
€6.2 million, or 10.0%, from €62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to €68.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €9.5 million, or 11.3%, from €83.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €92.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

   - Light Vehicle France: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle France segment increased by
€8.7 million, or 9.4%, from €92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to €101.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2016, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Light Vehicle France
segment increased from 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to 12.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2016. This increase as a percentage of revenue, in the context of significant gains in
market shares, was primarily due to (i) continuous improvements of purchasing conditions through our
CPUs, combined with a more integrated supply chain, leading to margin improvements, especially with
the new automated logistics platform Logisteo located in Réau; (ii) the rationalization of our
distribution network; and (iii) a lower level of fixed costs as a percentage of revenue in a context of
positive organic growth.

   - Trucks: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Trucks segment decreased by €2.8 million, from €2.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2015, to €(0.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and
Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Trucks segment decreased from 1.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to 0.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases were due to (i) a
slowdown in revenue in the context of challenging market conditions following a decrease in new
registrations since the beginning of the economic crisis; (ii) the lower management focus on our Trucks
segment during that period; and (iii) a number of underperforming workshop sites that required
turnaround. Those operational difficulties led us to implement a significant reorganization and profit
improvement plan of our Trucks segment, mainly over 2016 and 2017, through a geographical
repositioning of the distribution sites, a change in management and the closure of some
underperforming sites.

   - Light Vehicle International: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle International segment
increased by €1.7 million between the year ended December 31, 2015, and the year ended
December 31, 2016, solely due to the acquisition of Doyen Auto. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of the
Light Vehicle International segment was 4.2% in the year ended December 31, 2016, given that we had
not yet realized the synergies with Doyen Auto in 2016.

   - Headquarters: The Adjusted EBITDA of our Headquarters segment increased by €1.9 million, or
15.4%, from €(12.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2015, to €(10.2) million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a modification of the criteria for the calculation of our slow
moving inventory in 2016. This resulted in a one-off reversal (non-cash) of depreciation in 2016 at
Group level.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €19.0 million from €1.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015, to €20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2015, other income from
operations was exclusively composed of the reversal of a provision for risk for €1.4 million. In 2016, other
income from operations was mainly composed of (i) the reversal of an impairment of the Autodistribution brand
for €12.9 million which was booked in the early 2000s. An impairment test is carried out each year. In 2016 it
was assessed that the Autodistribution brand had regained popularity and that the impairment should be reversed.
As of December 31, 2016, the impairment was fully reversed; (ii) gains on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets for €4.8 million, related to the APS Berwald business and the proceeds of
distribution sites disposal; (iii) a €1.5 million income following the final settlement of a dispute related to the
acquisition of Finelist in the 1990s; and (iv) the reversal of a provision for risks for €1.2 million.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €4.0 million, or 67.8%, from €5.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, mainly due to (i) a goodwill
impairment of €2.1 million related to the Trucks segment as a result of the negative performance of the truck
parts for maintenance and repairs product line; (ii) costs related to the implementation of our transformation plan,
such as legal fees, restructuring costs, including rental early termination costs in connection with site closures, or
advisory costs related to the financial and capital transformation of the Group, and severance costs; and
(iii) expenses related to the acquisition of Doyen Auto. This increase was partly offset by a decrease of
restructuring costs related to the Light Vehicle France segment in 2016, following the implementation of a new
distribution model and reorganizations in regions in 2015.

Net financial expense increased by €11.8 million, from €26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015,
to €38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to (i) a €8.7 million redemption premium
paid to holders of the 6.5% senior secured notes due 2019 issued by the Issuer following the refinancing in
November 2016; and (ii) the increased cost of external borrowings caused by the increased amount borrowed
under the Existing Senior Secured Notes.

Net financial expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, also includes a €8.2 million write-off of
capitalized issuance fees (non-cash) related the 6.5% senior secured notes due 2019 issued by the Issuer
following the refinancing in November 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net financial expense
included a €6.7 million expense related to in the adjustment of the fair value of the sub bonds.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes were relatively stable, amounting to a €5.9 million credit for the year ended December 31,
2015, and a €6.0 million credit for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016,
income taxes comprised of a CVAE of €5.8 million (compared to €5.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2015), a current income tax credit of €1.3 million (compared to a €4.9 million current income tax expense for the
year ended December 31, 2015), mainly due to a negative tax result in the context of the higher level of costs
generated by the refinancing in 2016, and a deferred tax credit of €10.6 million (compared to a deferred tax credit
of €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015). This €5.7 million decrease in deferred taxes was mainly
due to the acquisition of Doyen Auto, which enabled us to consume reportable deficits faster than expected over
the following years.

_Net income from discontinued operations_

Net income from discontinued operations increased by €0.3 million, from €0.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and relates to AD Polska disposal.

_Net income_

As a result of the factors described above, our net income improved by €9.8 million, or 26.5%, from a net
income of €37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to a net income of €46.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements
of its business, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, operating losses,
acquisitions, and contractual obligations and commitments. Our principal sources of liquidity have been our
existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, factoring facilities, bank overdraft facilities
and finance leases.

We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash
generated from operations, debt securities (including the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes), any borrowings under our working capital and bank overdraft facilities, including our Revolving Credit
Facility, factoring facilities and finance leases.

Our financial condition and liquidity have been, and are expected to continue to be, influenced by a variety
of factors, including:

   - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

94


-----

   - the level of our outstanding indebtedness, and the interest we are obligated to pay on such
indebtedness, which affect our finance costs;

   - prevailing interest rates, which affect our debt service requirements;

   - our ability to continue to borrow funds from banks;

   - our level of acquisition activity; and

   - our capital expenditure requirements.

Our cash requirements are expected to consist mainly of the following:

   - paying operating costs and working capital;

   - funding capital expenditures;

   - funding potential acquisitions;

   - servicing indebtedness; and

   - paying taxes.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, future borrowings under our Revolving
Credit Facility and potential future borrowings under debt securities will be adequate to meet our anticipated
general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available
to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Senior
Secured Notes or other debt when due. If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our
capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and
our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit
from banks, other financial institutions, capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt and our
general financial performance. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured
_Notes—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors_
_outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness,_
_which may not be successful.”_

**_Historical cash flows_**

Net cash from operating activities is mainly impacted by changes in working capital and other items with a
cash effect, in addition to changes in net income and cancellations of unrealized income and expenses, the
elimination of financial expenses and income with a cash effect and the elimination of income tax.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €5.6 million, or 0.5% of revenue,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to the €14.1 million positive impact of net income,
plus a non-cash income and expenses adjustment of €41.1 million (mainly depreciation and amortization of
€26.6 million, reflecting the impact of the additional acquired fixed assets and of the depreciation and
amortization expenses related to the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and G-Group), partly offset by an
unfavorable change in working capital of €65.9 million due to an increase in inventories, particularly in
connection with our new Re´au platform, the early issuance of suppliers’ promissory notes and seasonal effects.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €95.6 million, or 10.3% of
revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to (i) the positive impact of net income
adjusted for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation and amortization of €21.7 million) and (ii) a
favorable change in working capital due to decrease in trade receivables as a result of the new non-recourse
factoring program that allows factored receivables to be deconsolidated.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €103.2 million, or 8.0% of
revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation and amortization of €29.8 million, reflecting
the impact of the amortization of the newly acquired Doyen Auto, Italian and Mondial Pare-Brise assets) and
favorable changes in working capital due to a decrease of receivables as a result of the new non-recourse
factoring program that allows factored receivables to be deconsolidated, which were partly offset by an increase
in inventories due to business acquisitions during the year and higher year-end activity to fulfill the end-of-year
rebates.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €60.5 million, or 5.9% of
revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €18.5 million), which was partly offset
by unfavorable changes in working capital due to higher levels of inventory, as a result of an increase in CPU
activity to take advantage of favorable year-end purchase conditions, as well as the timing of the payments of
other payables, such as tax and employee benefits.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €31.4 million, or 3.3% of
revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to improvement of net income after adjustments
for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €17.8 million), which was partly offset by an
unfavorable change in working capital as a result of a higher level of receivables and payables (mainly trade
receivables of €13.2 million) and an amount of CICE receivables of €7.2 million.

** For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, increase/(decrease) in trade payables are adjusted to exclude the effect of the
change in the amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes over the relevant periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017,
the amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes increased by €1.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the
amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes decreased by €15.4 million. The amount of undrawn suppliers’ promissory notes may be
significantly different from one month-end to another depending on whether month-end closing is a working or non-working day and on
whether suppliers cash-collect the promissory notes in due time or not.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we generated a negative change in working capital of
€50.5 million, primarily due to (i) a decrease of €14.9 million in trade payables as adjusted for undrawn
suppliers’ promissory notes, as a result of one-off seasonal effects, (ii) an increase in inventories of
€24.9 million, as a result of the expansion of our product offering, and (iii) a €10.6 million decrease of the net
liabilities from other receivables and payables, mainly due to the payment during the period of a one-off payable
for a professional conference in September 2018.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we generated a favorable change in working capital of
€28.6 million, primarily due to (i) a decrease of €16.3 million in trade payables, as adjusted for undrawn
suppliers’ promissory notes, as a result of seasonal effects and higher inventories due to the implementation of
the new Light Vehicle France central warehouse in Réau, (ii) a decrease in trade receivables of €58.4 million due
the new non-recourse factoring program and (iii) an increase in inventories of €7.2 million, primarily due to the
new Réau platform.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated a decrease in working capital of €14.3 million,
primarily due to a decrease in trade receivables of €44.4 million arising from to the new non-recourse factoring
program that allows factored receivables to be deconsolidated, which was partly offset by (i) an increase of
€9.7 million in inventories, mainly due to business acquisitions during the year and higher year-end activity to
fulfill the end-of-year rebates, (ii) a decrease in trade payables of €9.1 million mainly due to the longer payment
terms with suppliers that were negotiated in 2016 in preparation for the new Logisteo platform and (iii) a net cash
outflow of €11.3 million of the other receivables and payables, mainly due to the CICE financing.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated an increase in working capital of €14.1 million,
primarily due to (i) an increase of €13.1 million in inventories, which was mainly due to an increase in CPU
activity to take advantage of the favorable end-of-year purchasing conditions, the increase in painting stock
resulting from the opening of a dedicated painting platform, offering new storage capacity and implementation of
the new Logisteo platform; (ii) an outflow of €14.5 million in net other receivables and payables mainly due to
an increase in personnel expenses payables, as well as an increase in taxes payable (mainly VAT and CICE) due
to the timing of such payments, and (iii) a cash inflow of €13.5 million of the net trade receivables and trade
payables, as a result of higher level of payables explained by higher purchases by the CPUs at the end of the year.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced an increase in working capital of €33.2 million
which primarily reflected (i) an increase of €4.5 million in inventories, due to lower net provisions on inventories
resulting from an increase in activity, (ii) an outflow of €6.4 million in net other receivables and payables mainly
due to the build-up of CICE receivables, (iii) a decrease of €9.2 million in trade payables, mainly due to
suppliers’ payment terms reduction and (iv) an increase of €13.2 million in trade receivables due to an increase in
activity.

_Income tax paid_

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, income taxes paid by the Group was €6.4 million, mostly as
a result of the CVAE of €3.9 million, which is based on the added value generated by our French entities. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2017, income taxes paid by the Group was €5.6 million, mostly as a result of
the CVAE of €4.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income tax paid by the Group was
€8.8 million, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €5.6 million, which is based on the added value generated by our
French entities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, income tax paid by the Group was €6.8 million, mostly
as a result of the CVAE of €5.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, income tax paid by the Group
was €7.0 million, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €5.5 million.

** Restated by reclassifying €18.5 million of bank overdrafts of Italian entities outstanding on the date on which we acquired these entities,
from the line item business acquisitions (net of cash acquired) to the line item net cash and cash equivalents for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

Cash flow used in investing activities relates to (i) capital expenditure, which consists of the acquisitions of
non-current assets, and (ii) the acquisitions of business, net of cash acquired.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€97.5 million, as a result of new business acquisitions of €65.5 million, capital expenditures of €20.5 million and
change in customer financing and other transactions of €9.1 million primarily due to our acquisition of shares in
Oscaro in July 2018 for €10 million of consideration.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€72.7 million, as a result of new business acquisitions of €66.2 million and the capital expenditures of
€19.3 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€84.2 million, as a result of new business acquisitions of €67.1 million, new acquisition of the Autodistribution
Belux customer relationship asset of €10.0 million and capital expenditures of €28.0 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€104.9 million, as a result of new business acquisitions of €76.9 million and the capital expenditures of
€36.4 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€31.3 million, mostly as a result of the capital expenditures of €26.2 million.

_Capital Expenditures_

Our capital expenditures consist solely of the acquisition and maintenance of non-current assets. Our capital
expenditures include the further expansion of our operations and the maintenance of our existing operations. In
particular, our capital expenditure on tangible assets mainly relates to purchases of shelving and machinery for
the transport and storage of products in our warehouses, as well as purchases of commercial delivery vans that
we use in our operations. Our capital expenditure on intangible assets mainly relates to the capitalization of new

98


-----

functional development costs of our “Enterprise Resource Planning” software, the purchase of software licenses
relating to management and financial reporting, technical light vehicle and truck databases and inventory
management.

Capital expenditures increased by €1.2 million, to €20.5 million, or 1.9% of revenue, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, from €19.3 million, or 2.1% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30,
2017, primarily due to the increase of maintenance capital expenditures following the acquisitions of OVAM,
Ricauto, Topcar and Mondial Pare-Brise, partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to the
automated Logisteo platform which was finalized and launched in 2017.

Capital expenditures decreased by €8.4 million, to €28.0 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2017, from €36.4 million, or 3.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. This
decrease was primarily due to finalization and launch of the automated Logisteo platform during 2017. For the
year ended December 31, 2017, we made IT capital expenditures of €9.7 million, or 37.0% of our total capital
expenditure excluding new Logisteo platform, related to (i) ID Garages for €0.3 million; (ii) Autossimo
€2.6 million; (iii) Click & Collect AD.fr for €1.1 million; and (iv) Other IT and Digital investments for
€5.7 million.

Capital expenditures increased by €10.2 million to €36.4 million, or 3.6% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2016 from €26.2 million, or 2.7% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily
due to investments in the new Logisteo platform of €14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to €3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and, to a lesser extent, to higher IT capital
expenditures related to the headquarter. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we made IT capital expenditures
of €5.4 million, or 24.5% of the total capital expenditure excluding new Logisteo platform, related to (i) ID
Garages for €0.2 million; (ii) Autossimo €1.6 million; (iii) Click & Collect AD.fr for €0.4 million; and (iv) Other
IT and Digital investments for €3.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we made IT capital
expenditures of €5.5 million, or 24.7% of the total capital expenditure excluding new Logisteo platform, related
to (i) ID Garages for €0.1 million; (ii) Autossimo €0.8 million; (iii) Click & Collect AD.fr for €0.2 million; and
(iv) Other IT and Digital investments for €4.4 million.

We intend to continue expanding our footprint in Western Europe through capital expenditure investments
on existing businesses as well as acquisitions of other distributors. We plan to invest approximately 2% of our
revenue in capital expenditures related to maintenance and development of our existing business.

_Business acquisitions_

Business acquisitions mainly relate to external acquisitions. The amount of the acquisition is presented net
of cash (or overdraft) held by such acquired entity.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €65.5 million, or 6.2% of revenue, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to acquisitions of G-Group, FGL Srl and Geevers.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €66.2 million, or 7.1% of revenue, for the nine months

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €67.1 million, or 5.3% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made four acquisitions: (i) in March 2017 we
purchased 100% of the capital stock of Mondial Pare-Brise for an amount of €35.8 million, which aims to create

100% of APS Berwald (ten sites in Moselle) for €4.2 million.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €76.9 million, or 7.5% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made four acquisitions: (i) in February 2016
we purchased 70% of the capital stock of Automax Marseille for an amount of €1.7 million, which was combined
with ACR to create a leading platform for automotive parts in Marseille; (ii) in March 2016 we purchased 34%

**Credit management policy**

We have adopted credit management procedures adjusted to the characteristics of the market and of our
customers in order to reduce the risk of exposure and to attempt to allow prompt and proactive management of
our business. The proactive customer credit risk monitoring activities start by grouping consumers based on their
type, the duration of credit, the existence of previous financial difficulties or notifications and of the possible
existence of legal or ongoing bankruptcy procedures. Financial assets are recorded in the financial statements net
of the write-off based on the risk of breach by the counterparty, which is determined based on the available
information regarding the customer’s solvency.

**Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about financial risk**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks. We monitor and
manage these risks as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce their potential adverse effects on our results of
operations.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The euro is the functional currency in which our financial statements are presented.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risks due to our need to finance our operations as well as to utilize our
available liquidity. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a negative or a positive impact on our financial
results by indirectly influencing the repayment of loans and investments. Following this Offering, our
indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate
Notes (which have a fixed interest rate) and the Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate
Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (which borrowings will have an interest rate based on EURIBOR or
LIBOR, reset periodically). We do not currently intend to hedge the interest rate payments on our Existing Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes and Senior Secured Notes to be issued on the Issue Date. We may, however, decide
to do so in the future.

We evaluate our exposure to changes in interest rates on a regular basis and may decide to manage the
foregoing risks through financial derivatives, according to the directives contained in the “Interest rate risk
management policy” we have adopted. Notwithstanding our potential use of hedging instruments, unexpected
changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**Off-balance sheet arrangements**

We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. For a description of certain commitments
and guarantees that we have given to third parties in connection with our financing arrangements and other
ordinary course rental and other obligations, see note 13 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and note
16 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Other financial obligations: pension obligations**

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations, see note 8 to our audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Critical accounting policies**

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and assumptions that affect
the results we report. Such estimates or assumptions are based on our historical experience and currently
available information, including expectations of future events that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ significantly from such estimates in light of the uncertainty surrounding
the assumptions and conditions upon which the estimates are based. The following are significant accounting
policies determined on the basis of such estimates and assumptions for which changes during a financial period
could involve a significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.

102


-----

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, we assess whether there is any indication that a non- financial asset
might be impaired. The impairment tests are based on the four-year EBITDA plan for each cost generating unit
(“CGU”) as defined by us. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or group of
CGUs most likely to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and to the lowest level at which
goodwill is monitored by us. The CGUs correspond to subsidiaries or groups of subsidiaries that are included in
the same operating segment and that generate cash flows largely independent from those generated by other
CGUs.

The assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result following the
changes of all assumptions. Each year and whenever there is an indication of impairment, we carry out
impairment tests. A valuation of the AD brand is also performed separately, bearing in mind that the impairment
of the brand is reversible if events occur that show that indicators that led to a loss being recorded no longer
exist.

**_Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that we will have
future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The calculation of the amount of
deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate how long it will take to use up the
losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits, with regard to tax management strategies.

**_Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These valuations rely on
assumptions regarding discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the rate of salary increases and the
mortality rate. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans, there is great uncertainty about these estimates.

**_Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold products in
accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

**Overview**

The Western European light vehicle spare parts market comprises three main components: (1) the
manufacturing and supply of spare parts by parts manufacturers (“original equipment suppliers” or “OES”) (such
as Bosch, Faurecia, Knorr-Bremse and Valeo) and the supply of branded spare parts by car manufacturers (“car
manufacturers” or “OEM”) (such as Fiat, Peugeot, Renault and VW) who are in turn supplied with spare parts by
the OES; (2) the distribution of spare parts by OE car dealer networks and IAM distributors; and (3) retail sales
and service to drivers by garages, independent repairers, autocenters, tire specialists and fast fitters, as well as
retail locations (such as spare parts outlets and scrap yards) and online players. We are a distributor in the IAM
of the European light vehicle spare parts market and does not act directly as a repairer in this market.

The graphic below shows the flow of light vehicle spare parts from suppliers, through aftermarket
distributors to retail and service center customers and finally to drivers.

We also operate in the IAM of the truck spare parts market in France. Like the Western European light
vehicle spare parts market, the truck spare parts distribution and repair market in France comprises three main
components: (1) the manufacturing and supply of spare parts by OEM (such as Bosch, Mahle and Wabco) and
the supply of branded spare parts by OEM (such as DAF, Iveco, Krone, Man, Mercedes Benz, Renault Trucks
and Schmitz) who are in turn supplied with spare parts by the OEM; (2) the distribution of spare parts by OE
truck dealer networks, IAM networks and integrated workshops; and (3) maintenance and repair by garages,
certified repairers/agents, and integrated workshops. We act as both a distributor and a repairer in the IAM of the
truck spare parts market in France.

104


-----

The graphic below shows the flow of truck spare parts from suppliers, through the OE truck dealer
networks, IAM networks and integrated workshops to retail and service center customers and finally to owners
and operators of truck fleets.

Light vehicle and truck spare part manufacturing is characterized by a high level of part complexity and
density. Due to the number of vehicle variants in the market and the multiplicity of pieces per vehicle (8,000 per
car on average), spare parts manufacturers collectively produce several million SKUs. OE car and truck dealer
networks primarily source spare parts from specific OEMs and OESs, while IAM distributors mainly employ a
less expensive, multi-brand sourcing approach. Light vehicle and truck spare parts and products can be grouped
as follows:

   - repair and maintenance, such as radiators, alternators, steering and suspension components, brake
systems, spark plugs, oil filters (64% of Group sales in 2017);

   - body parts, such as hoods, bumpers, doors, wings, glass, paints (18% of Group sales in 2017);

   - repairer equipment, such as diagnostic tools (11% of Group sales in 2017); and

   - oil, tires and consumables and accessories, such as antifreeze, coolant, in-car entertainment, navigation
systems (approximately 7% of Group sales in 2017).

The Western European light vehicle aftermarket distributes spare parts to garages, certified repairers,
autocenters, tire specialists, fast fitters, retailers and web dealers.

_Garages generally may repair cars from all brands with IAM spare parts and may be “independent” or_
“affiliated” with a brand. Affiliated garages include AD-branded garages, Bosch Car Service and Top Garage.

_Certified repairers operate under an OEM banner, such as Renault, Peugeot, VW or Fiat._

_Autocenters are generally self-service shops located near supermarkets. Norauto and Feu Vert are examples_
of autocenters.

_Tire specialists principal activity is tire sales and changing. Euromaster and Eurotyre are examples of tire_
specialists.

_Fast fitters are focused on quick service, focused on tires and maintenance. Speedy and Midas are examples_
of fast fitters.

_Retailers include spare parts outlets, supermarkets, scrap yards and gas stations, such as Total, l’Auto E._
Leclerc and Roady.

_Web dealers can be split into three categories: generalists (such as Oscaro and Mr. Auto), online tire_
specialists (Allopneus) and, to a lesser extent, e-commerce generalists.

The truck aftermarket in France also distributes spare parts to garages, certified repairers/agents and
integrated workshops. Integrated workshops are owned by truck fleet operators and generally have a level of

technical expertise below that of OEM and IAM networks and, as a result, often outsource repairs other than
routine maintenance to OEM and IAM networks. Veolia and XPO are examples of integrated workshops.

**_Overview of the Western European light vehicle IAM_**

The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket generated total revenue of approximately
€27 billion in 2017. From 2017 to 2022, the overall Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket
is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.6% to €29.1 billion, due to moderate growth in the number of cars on the road
(the “car parc”) and price increases, which are expected to offset stable job frequency.

The Western European light vehicle IAM is a large and growing channel of the Western European light
vehicle distribution core aftermarket, and tends to be resilient and fragmented, presenting significant
opportunities for consolidation, with high visibility into the future addressable market. From 2017 to 2022, the
overall Western European light vehicle IAM is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 2.0% to €17.6 billion. The graphic
below shows market sizes as of 2017 and growth forecasts for the 2017 to 2022 period for the light vehicle
distribution core aftermarkets and IAMs in each of the countries where we operate, as well as certain adjacent
geographies.

The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is expected to grow between 1% and 3%
in all geographies shown over the 2017 to 2022 period, with growth in the IAMs forecast to exceed or be on par
with such growth in each country over the same period. This forecast is consistent with the recent trend of
outperformance by the IAMs as compared with their OE car dealer network competitors and the Western
European distribution core aftermarket as a whole.

Between 2014 and 2017, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket grew at a CAGR
of 1.8%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc, while the Western European light vehicle IAM
gained market share and grew more quickly, at a CAGR of 2.9%, further driven by aging of a growing car parc.
The Western European car parc has generally grown in size since 2011, growing at a CAGR of 1.0% between
2011 and 2016 and a CAGR of 0.8% between 2016 and 2018 (estimated). Additionally, average total mileage
driven has climbed since 2011, growing at a CAGR of 0.6% between 2011 and 2016 and a CAGR of 0.6%
between 2016 and 2018 (estimated), representing an increase from 3.3 billion kilometers of total mileage in 2011
to 3.4 billion kilometers of total mileage in 2018 (estimated). The Western European car parc has also aged, with
the average age of cars increasing from 9.9 years in 2012 to 11.0 years in 2016.

This trend is expected to continue, with forecast growth at a CAGR of 1.6% in the Western European light
vehicle distribution core aftermarket over the 2017 to 2022 period, compared with a CAGR of 2.0% in the
Western European light vehicle IAM. The Western European light vehicle IAM is consequently expected to
continue gaining market share over the same period.

Distribution aftermarket for Western Europe (Belgium, France,
Italy, Spain and the Netherlands), excluding tires, oil and
consumables.

The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket tends to be resilient, stemming from the
fact that even when new car sales fluctuate, the installed car parc requires ongoing repair and maintenance, which
favors the aftermarket generally and the price-competitive IAM particularly.

As an example of this resilience, the graphic below compares the size of the car parc, new light vehicle sales
and the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket in France for the periods shown. Even when new light vehicle
sales in France declined, the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket showed stable growth.

The Western European light vehicle IAM has a high level of visibility into the future addressable market,
due to the fact that its target market is cars aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are
covered by warranty and maintenance contracts and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a
result, IAM distributors can project today the parc that will be serviceable in five years because parc size, vehicle
types and installed technology are known from the point of production.

2014 2017 2022e

As shown above, the IAM held 29% market share of the overall truck spare parts distribution and repair
market in France in 2017. The IAM’s share of the truck spare parts distribution and repair market in France has
been stable since 2014 and is expected to grow slightly through 2022. The truck IAM in France is forecast to
grow at a CAGR of 0.7% over the 2017 to 2022 period (with 0.7% growth at repair level and flat performance at
distribution level). This growth follows a negative 0.1% CAGR over the 2014 to 2017 period. The decline during
the 2014 to 2017 period was due in part to the drop in new truck registrations in 2009 and 2010 (declining from
58,000 registrations in 2008 to 36,000 registrations in 2009 and 34,000 registrations in 2010). The number of
truck registrations in France began to recover in 2014, growing to 38,000, with growth to 42,000, 47,000 and
50,000 in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, representing a CAGR of 9.6% over the 2014 to 2017 period. The
number of truck registrations in France in 2018 is forecast to be stable at 50,000. In 2017, there were
approximately 1 million trucks on the road in France. The forecast growth for the 2017 to 2022 period is
expected to be driven by growth in the number of trucks in the fleet (the “truck fleet”) aged five to ten years from

108


-----

2019 onwards, with 2% CAGR predicted from 2019 to 2022. Additionally, increasing complexity of parts is
expected to drive growth in the truck IAM in France as the need for “one-stop” shops grows.

**Market drivers and growth potential**

There are four key market drivers in the Western European light vehicle IAM and the truck IAM in France:

   - _Size of the parc / fleet, which refers to the total number of light vehicles or trucks in operation and_
which is driven primarily by new light vehicle or truck sales;

   - _Age of the parc / fleet, which refers to the average age of light vehicles or trucks in operation and which_
is driven by the frequency with which older light vehicles or trucks are replaced with new light vehicles
or trucks;

   - _Prices for spare parts, which is driven primarily by increasing complexity and sophistication of parts_
and systems; and

   - _Job frequency, which refers to the frequency with which repairs and replacement parts are needed,_
which is in turn connected to the number of accidents, the increasing reliability of vehicles and to
average mileage.

For further information on the size and age of the car parc, see “Industry—Overview of the Western
_European light vehicle IAM.”_

We have observed increasing prices of spare parts in correlation to the increasing complexity of “next
generation” vehicles, as shown in the graphic below.

In addition, we benefit from a favorable regulatory environment, which is characterized by deregulation of
captive parts pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) 461/2010 and Commission Regulation (EU) No
330/2010, EU-level initiatives that favor the transition to low- and zero-emission vehicles pursuant to the Paris
agreement, increasingly strict French regulation on technical inspections of vehicles as well as potential future
regulatory developments that may favor autonomous vehicles. Deregulation of captive parts is expected to have a
favorable effect on the IAM distributors, enabling them to address more vehicles aged nine years and under. A
transition to low- or zero emission vehicles, as well as the rollout of autonomous vehicles, could positively
impact IAM distributors by increasing the frequency and number of compulsory testing for vehicles in order to
meet various emissions standards as well as contributing to a more general trend whereby more complex, “new
generation” vehicles drive higher parts prices, as discussed above. Likewise, increasingly strict regulations
relating to inspections could also lead to increased volumes of service and repair.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in France_**

France is the third largest light vehicle distribution aftermarket in Western Europe. The French light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket is large and mature, with revenue of €5.7 billion in 2017, and is forecast to grow at
a CAGR of 1.1% over the 2017 to 2022 period, reaching €6.0 billion in 2022. This represents similar growth to
the 2014 to 2017 period (1.2% CAGR). Growth of the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket through
2022 is expected to be supported by car parc growth (from 37.8 million units in 2014 to 38.0 million units in
2017 and forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.3% from 2017 to 2022, due in part to a rebound of new light vehicle

sales in recent years), car parc aging (with 74% of the car parc currently above four years and the average car age
having increased from 8.9 years in 2014 to 9.2 years in 2017 and forecast to rise to 9.3 years in 2022), increase in
average car mileage (at a CAGR of 0.7% from 2017 to 2022) and spare parts price increases (at a CAGR of 1.3%
from 2017 to 2022) driven by increasing complexity of parts. Price increases are likely to be somewhat offset by
pricing pressure from lower-end distributors.

The light vehicle IAM in France generated revenue of €3.5 billion in 2017 and is growing at a more
dynamic pace (forecast CAGR of 1.6% over the 2017 to 2022 period) than both French light vehicle OE car
dealer networks (forecast CAGR of 0.3% over the 2017 to 2022 period) and the French light vehicle distribution
core aftermarket (forecast CAGR of 1.1% over the 2017 to 2022 period). In 2017, the light vehicle IAM in
France held 62% of market share, which is expected to increase to 63% by 2022, driven by aging of the car parc
positively impacting IAM volumes.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Benelux_**

The Netherlands and Belgium are the fifth and sixth largest light vehicle distribution aftermarkets,
respectively, in Western Europe. The Dutch and Belgian light vehicle distribution core aftermarkets generated
total revenue of €1.75 billion and €0.89 billion, respectively, in 2017 and are forecast to grow at a CAGR of
0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, over the 2017 to 2022 period, reaching €1.81 billion and €0.94 billion, respectively,
in 2022. Growth in these markets through 2022 is expected to be supported by slight price increases driven by
increasing complexity of parts, in spite of limited expected car parc growth and slightly declining average
mileage and job frequency.

The light vehicle IAMs in the Netherlands and Belgium generated total revenue of €1.0 billion and
€0.5 billion, respectively, in 2017 and are both growing on par with the Dutch and Belgian light vehicle
distribution core aftermarkets (forecast CAGR of 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, over the 2017 to 2022 period). In
2017, the light vehicle IAMs in the Netherlands and Belgium comprised 60% and 59% of market share,
respectively, of their distribution core aftermarkets and are expected to remain stable through 2022.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Italy_**

Italy is the second largest light vehicle distribution aftermarket in Western Europe. In Italy, the light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket is large and mature, with revenue of €6.6 billion in 2017, and is forecast to grow at
a CAGR of 1.9% over the 2017 to 2022 period, reaching €7.2 billion in 2022. Growth of this market through
2022 is expected to be supported by car parc growth (driven by the recovery of the Italian economy), increasing
car mileage, aging of the car parc and slight price increases driven by increasing complexity of parts. Price
increases are likely to be somewhat offset by declining job frequency due to a reduction in accidents and
improvements to part quality.

The light vehicle IAM in Italy generated total revenue of €4.1 billion in 2017 and is growing at a more
dynamic pace (forecast CAGR of 2.8% over the 2017 to 2022 period) than the Italian light vehicle distribution
core aftermarket (forecast CAGR of 1.9% over the 2017 to 2022 period). Growth in the light vehicle IAM in Italy
over the 2017 to 2022 period is expected to be driven by an aging car parc and the ability of IAMs to offer more
competitive pricing.

-----

In 2017, the light vehicle IAM in Italy comprised 62% of market share of the Italian light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket, which is expected to increase to 65% by 2022, primarily driven by competitive
pricing.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Spain_**

Spain is the fourth largest light vehicle distribution aftermarket in Western Europe. We are not currently
directly present in Spain. However, Spain represents an area for potential expansion by us in the future and
displays favorable market dynamics similar to the countries in which we are already present. In Spain, the light
vehicle distribution core aftermarket generated total revenue of €4.3 billion in 2017 and is forecast to grow at a
CAGR of 2.6% over the 2017 to 2022 period, reaching €4.9 billion in 2022. Growth of this market through 2022
is expected to be supported by car parc growth (driven by recovery in the Spanish economy) and price increases,
in turn driven by technological improvements and inflation, while job frequency is expected to remain stable.

The light vehicle IAM in Spain generated total revenue of €2.4 billion in 2017 and is growing on par with
the Spanish light vehicle distribution core aftermarket (forecast CAGR of 2.6% over the 2017 to 2022 period). In
2017, the light vehicle IAM in Spain comprised 56% of market share of the Spanish distribution core aftermarket
and is expected to remain stable through 2022.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the truck spare parts and repair aftermarket in France_**

The truck aftermarket in France generated total revenue of €4.6 billion in 2017, of which €1.4 billion was in
our addressable truck spare parts distribution and repair market. From 2017 to 2022, the truck aftermarket in
France is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.8%, due to an aging truck fleet and increasing prices partly offset by
decreasing job frequency. Our addressable truck spare parts distribution and repair market in France is expected
to demonstrate growth at a CAGR of 0.7% in the 2017 to 2022 period, driven by a slightly growing truck fleet
and increasing maintenance costs, due to increasing technical complexity of parts.

**Competitive landscape**

There are two principal types of players in the Western European light vehicle spare parts distribution
aftermarket: OE car dealer networks and IAM distributors. The OE car dealer network aftermarket is composed
of OEM repairers (who are closely connected to the OEMs) and certified repairers. The Western European light
vehicle IAM is composed of a large number of small, independent distributors and a limited number of large
groups, which incorporate a number of distribution and retail brands. The largest of the groups in Western
Europe in 2017 was LKQ/Stahlgruber, followed by GPC/Alliance Automotive Group, WM Trost, us and Inter
Cars.

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in France_**

The light vehicle IAM in France is highly fragmented, with the top two players holding approximately 45%
of market share and approximately 2,000 independent players holding 33% of market share in 2017. In 2017, we
held the largest market share among independent players (29%), followed by Groupauto (16%), Precisium (6%),
Partner’s, Groupe IDLP and Laurent (4% each) and Flauraud (3%). Additionally, some of the large IAM groups
discussed above are also active in France.

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Benelux_**

The light vehicle IAM Belgium is relatively consolidated, with the top five players holding 51% of market
share. In 2017, LKQ held the largest market share (23%), followed by us (16%) and Geevers (4%), which we
acquired in 2018.

The light vehicle IAM in the Netherlands is consolidated, with the top four players holding 73% of market
share. In 2017, LKQ held the largest market share (35%), followed by Auto Binck Group (26%), Groupauto
(10%) and us (2%).

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Italy_**

The light vehicle IAM in Italy is extremely fragmented, with the top three players holding only 13% of
market share, with the remainder held by approximately 150 independent distributors and approximately 5,000
“jobbers” (the Italian market includes “jobbers” (ricambisti) who act as an additional layer in its distribution
chain between distributors and garages). In 2017, LKQ held the largest market share (8%), followed by us (3%,
including OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car) and Datacol (2%).

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Spain_**

The light vehicle IAM in Spain is extremely fragmented, with the top five players collectively holding only
15% of market share. In 2017, Lausan held the largest market share (4%), followed by AD Grupo Regueira,
Cecauto, Grupo Davasa and Grupo Vemare (3% each).

**_Competitive landscape in the truck spare parts distribution and repair aftermarket in France_**

There are three types of players in the truck aftermarket in France: OE truck dealer networks, IAM networks
and integrated workshops. Similar to the light vehicle aftermarkets, OE truck dealer networks are connected to an
OEM and are focused on newer vehicles, generally aged under five years and within their warranty period. DAF,
Iveco, Man, Mercedes Benz, Renault Trucks and Volvo are examples of OE truck dealer networks. Truck IAM
networks may operate under a banner (that is, they are affiliated with or owned by wholesalers) or may be pure
independents, and generally focus on trucks aged over five years. AD, TVI and Grupauto are examples of truck
IAM networks.

In France in 2017, we held 18% of market share in the truck IAM in France. The top four players (in terms
of revenue) held 50% of market share in the truck IAM in France in 2017, led by us and G-Truck/Top Truck
(18% each) and followed by TVI (8%) and Todd (5%). We also compete with OE truck dealer networks. In
France in 2017, we operated the largest truck IAM player in terms of revenue and distribution network size, with
200 sites, as compared with its three closest competitors, Alliance Automotive Group, Todd Group and Autolia
Group who had, respectively, 189, 112 and 83 sites. We also operated the second largest distribution network
overall in 2017, following Renault Trucks (300 sites) and followed by Iveco (200 sites) and Mercedes Benz (160
sites).

**BUSINESS**

_Unless otherwise indicated, the financial and operational data presented herein do not include Verviers_
_Freins and Oscaro._

**Overview**

We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux and Italy, with over 55 years of experience. Since
the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline) distributor
in the business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) segments. We
hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by our unique operational model and value-added
services proposition, our history of organic growth and value-accretive acquisition-led growth as well as our
strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, we generated revenue of
€1,379.2 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €128.2 million. After giving effect to the acquisitions of Verviers
Freins and Oscaro, we had a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €168.5 million for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018.

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017. We also hold
leading positions around the rest of Western Europe and, in 2017, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM
distributor in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands.

We have strengthened our leading position in France with the acquisition of Oscaro, the French leader in
online sales of light vehicle spare parts. Oscaro is one of the first online players to offer new spare parts from
manufacturers and wholesalers, generating the majority of its revenue from the B2C (DIY) segment. Oscaro
offers approximately 1 million SKUs and operates mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in other markets such
as Spain. We expect the acquisition of Oscaro to help develop our international presence online, as we intend to
roll out Oscaro’s online sales platform to other countries in which we operate.

We operate our business through three operational segments which address the light vehicle independent
aftermarket in France (“Light Vehicle France”), certain light vehicle independent aftermarkets in Benelux and
Italy (“Light Vehicle International”) and the truck independent aftermarket in France (“Trucks”). The pie charts
below show the breakdown of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, by segment and by customer.
In the future, we will report Oscaro in a new, separate segment.

Source: Company information

We operate in the French, Benelux and Italian independent aftermarkets. In recent years, we have grown
externally through strategic acquisitions to develop our international presence, such as with the acquisitions of
Doyen Auto in 2016, Geevers Auto Parts B.V. (“Geevers”) in May 2018 and Verviers Freins in October 2018 in
Benelux, and the acquisitions of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car in 2017 and Genfin S.r.l. and its subsidiaries
constituting the G-Group (“G-Group”) in June 2018 in Italy. We have also grown through strategic acquisitions

113


-----

to expand our complementary product offerings, such as with the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise in 2017,
giving us access to the windscreen and window (“auto glass”) replacement market.

We operate in the independent aftermarkets segment within the growing and resilient Western European
light vehicle spare parts distribution “core” aftermarket and the stable and mature truck spare parts distribution
and repair “core” aftermarket in France. The independent aftermarkets segment in which we operate is generally
outperforming or on par with original equipment car and truck dealer networks and the wider core aftermarkets.
The overall Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is expected to grow between 1% and
3% per annum over the 2017 to 2022 period, with growth in the independent aftermarkets forecast to exceed or
be on par with this growth over the same period while gaining market share from original equipment car dealer
networks. The overall truck spare parts distribution and repair “core” aftermarket in France is forecast to grow at
a CAGR of 0.8% over the 2017 to 2022 period, with the independent aftermarkets holding stable market share
and forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.7% over the same period. Key market drivers for both the light vehicle and
truck independent aftermarkets are expected to be favorable during the 2017 to 2022 period, including a growing
and aging addressable car parc and rising prices due to the increasing complexity of spare parts.

One of our key strengths is our control over the value chain through our proven multi-channel operational
model that delivers superior product availability and best-in-class delivery lead times. Our distribution is carried
out by a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who
distribute our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail
locations and online players. Our ability to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and
distribution, through to customers has a strong impact on margins. For example, our automated platforms enable
us to centralize more flows, which in turn generates logistics fees from suppliers. Generally, the logistics fees we
charge to suppliers are greater than the logistics costs we incur. Our unique operational model is founded on our
excellent relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms, extensive Western
European distribution network and a broad and loyal base of customers to which we deliver a wide range of
value-added services, leading to customer loyalty. Our operational model is based on four components:
procurement and suppliers, upstream logistics control, local distribution and customers, as shown in the graphic
below.

Our model is based on the distinctive, dual proposition of distributing products to customers coupled with
providing value-added services (many of which are digital or online services) to both suppliers and customers.
To suppliers, we offer a unique access to a wide, diversified and fragmented customer base, which suppliers are
not able to efficiently address themselves. We also offer suppliers a number of value-added services, such as
marketing support and access to our state-of-the-art automated warehousing capabilities which allow suppliers to
arrange deliveries to a single delivery point. To customers, we provide a comprehensive product offering and
best-in-class delivery times combined with value-added services, such as commercial, technical and training
support, strong and integrated branding and online tools, which cultivate high customer loyalty and drive market
share gain.

Our revenue grew from €914 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to €1.4 billion for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2018, with an average organic growth rate of approximately 3% per annum over the
period. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our Adjusted EBITDA was €67.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA
margin was 7.3%. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was €128.2 million and
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.3%.

**Our strengths**

**_Growing, resilient and highly visible Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket, with IAMs_**
**_outperforming the overall market_**

We operate in the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket, which has forecasted
revenue growth of 1% to 3% over the 2017 to 2022 period. Within this market, the IAMs in which we operate
show particular strength and growth potential due to two long-term market dynamics: the stable, slightly
increasing Western European car parc and an increase in average vehicle age are expected to drive growth in the
number of cars that can be serviced by light vehicle IAM distributors like us in the coming years. Additionally,
increasing vehicle complexity and computerization of car systems is expected to drive increased prices and job
frequency.

In addition, the Western European light vehicle IAM tends to be resilient in the face of macroeconomic
factors that impact the automotive industry and distribution markets generally. While new car sales tend to
fluctuate with economic cycles, the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket benefits from a slightly but
steadily growing installed car parc, due to the ongoing need for repairs to be made on the existing car parc
regardless of downturns in the economy. For example, even when new car purchases declined in France
following the financial crisis (from approximately 2.2 million in 2009 to approximately 1.8 million in 2014), the
French car parc and the French light vehicle spare parts market continued to grow steadily in size because new
car sales only account for a small portion of the overall car parc. Approximately 2.1 million new cars were sold
in France in 2017, compared with a car parc of approximately 40 million cars in total. The light vehicle IAM is
also relatively less affected by economic downturns because, as new car sales decrease, the existing car parc’s
age and mileage increase, thereby increasing the need for maintenance and repair. In economic downturns
customers are more price-sensitive, and IAMs distributors, such as us, are generally more price-competitive than
OE car dealer networks.

Light vehicle IAM distributors also have the benefit of a high level of visibility in terms of the future
addressable market of cars needing service and repair. The addressable market for the light vehicle IAM is cars
aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts
and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a result, we can project the size and composition
of the car parc that will require service in the five to ten-year range because parc size, vehicle types and installed
technology are known from the point of production. We generally service cars over a long period of time (from
five to twenty years), which may require multiple repairs and parts replacements over their lifespan.
Additionally, we distribute parts for cars that span the entire car parc, covering a wide range of makes and
models, and giving us a wider addressable market, as compared to our OE car dealer network competitors who
generally distribute parts for cars from just one manufacturer.

Moreover, we are able to offer lower prices than our OEM counterparts as IAM spare parts prices are on
average 30% lower than those of equivalent OEM-branded spare parts. Furthermore, in France, T-1 technicians
working for our distributor customers cost on average €45 to €60 per hour, while equivalent technicians working
for an OEM distributor would cost on average €70 to €110 per hour (depending on location). We therefore
benefit from being on average 30% less expensive than our OEM counterparts, both from the standpoint of
product prices and of labor costs, which we believe makes us the preferred solution for end-customers,
particularly after their original car warranty has expired.

As a result of the factors described above, growth of the light vehicle IAM is forecast to exceed or be on par
with the growth of the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket on the whole, for all of Western Europe and also
on a country by country basis, for the 2017 to 2022 period. The Western European light vehicle IAM has
historically outperformed both the broader market and its OE car dealer network competitors, a trend which is
expected to continue in the 2017 to 2022 period. Between 2014 and 2017, the Western European light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket grew at a CAGR of 1.8%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc,
while the Western European light vehicle IAM grew more quickly, at a CAGR of 2.9%, further driven by aging
of this growing car parc. From 2017 to 2022, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is
forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.6%, while the Western European light vehicle IAM is forecast to grow more

115


-----

quickly, at a CAGR of 2.0%. Additionally, the Western European light vehicle IAM is consequently expected to
continue gaining market share over the same period, growing from 59% of the market (in terms of revenue) in
2017 to 60% of the market in 2022.

**_A leading independent B2B and B2C (DIY) spare parts distributor strongly positioned in the attractive_**
**_Western European light vehicle and truck IAMs_**

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2017. We also hold
leading positions around Western Europe and, in 2017, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM distributor
in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands. We believe that
the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018 will strengthen our position in the light vehicle spare parts market in
France as well as our online capabilities, such that we are the only multichannel B2B, B2C (DIY) and
business-to-consumer player in the independent aftermarket auto parts distribution sector in Europe. Oscaro had
approximately 2.5 million customers and received approximately 345,000 orders a month in 2017. Oscaro had
sales of approximately €325 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and approximately €308 million for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2018.

In addition to the Western European market being highly attractive, there are barriers to entry in the Western
European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket and scale benefits favor larger distributors. These barriers to
entry include the extensive logistics, technology and network investments that are necessary to service a broad
and fragmented customer base seeking supply of several million SKUs for rapid and continuous delivery and the
difficulty in building sufficient brand awareness and long-term relationships with suppliers that are necessary to
negotiate competitive pricing. Additionally, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is
fragmented, with significant potential for consolidation, giving an edge to large distributors, such as us, who are
able to service the entire value chain and make strategic acquisitions.

We have outperformed the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket and the light vehicle IAM in
France. Over the 2014 to 2017 period, our Light Vehicle France Revenue had an average organic growth rate of
3.4%, while revenue in the light vehicle IAM in France and the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket
grew more slowly (1.7% and 1.2%, respectively). We also outperformed the French B2B distribution market in
terms of profitability, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13% in 2017, as compared with market benchmarks
for other B2B distributors at 7% to 9%.

Our superior brand awareness is evidence of our strong positioning in the IAMs in which we operate.
According to an independent third-party survey conducted in France in 2017, the “Autodistribution” brand
enjoyed the highest brand awareness among its light vehicle distributor peers in France, with 92% brand
awareness (including unprompted awareness of 74% and prompted awareness of 18%). The second ranking
player in France had only 37% brand awareness. The “Autodistribution” brand also had a net promoter score of
59% in 2017; the two second ranking players had net promoter scores of 31%. In 2017, we were also the leader
among truck spare parts distributors in France in terms of prompted awareness (47%), with 2.5 times higher
awareness than the number two player and had the highest net promoter score, with 75% of positive answers.

We are also poised to benefit from key megatrends in the automotive industry. These megatrends consist of
increasing technical complexity and parts pricing and the increasing popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles
and of mobility and connectivity services. We forecast that 1.4% of addressable cars will be electric by 2025 and
that up to 80% of the aftermarket revenue in spare parts for those cars will be addressable by light vehicle IAM
distributors such as us. We have demonstrated our ability to continuously ramp up our products and services
offering to serve increasingly complex, computerized cars by proactively investing in technical support systems,
state-of-the-art garage technology, technician training and diagnostic tools that are adapted to electric and hybrid
cars.

We are also well positioned to address “mobility” shifts, in particular with our customers involved in fleet
management, through which public fleets will play a greater role. With our state-of-the-art logistics platforms
and extensive range of value-added customer service solutions, we are well positioned to meet the needs of fleet
operators who look to external supply and fleet management on a large scale. For example, we have partnered
with Oocar, which provides connected platforms, and we offer Auto Connect units for installation in vehicles,
which are box units that collect data using proprietary algorithms and allow drivers and technicians to track a
vehicle’s systems performance remotely and provide additional services, in real time, through connected devices.

**_Operational excellence based on a fully-integrated multi-channel distribution model with full control over the_**
**_value chain, offering superior product availability and best-in-class delivery times_**

We offer best-in-class product selection, availability and delivery times, giving us a significant advantage
over our competitors. We focus on delivering “the right product to the right place at the right time” relying on
our fully-integrated, multi-channel distribution model which is grounded in our extensive distribution network.

We are fully integrated, allowing us to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and
distribution, to end-customers. We are strongly and uniquely positioned as a central distribution intermediary for
all value chain levels, acting as an important link between parts suppliers and customers. We have built longterm relationships and enjoy significant purchasing power with a strategically concentrated group of suppliers,
resulting in excellent purchasing conditions for our CPUs. Through this supplier concentration strategy, we have
rationalized our supplier relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260
in 2018, allowing us to negotiate better terms with this smaller group of suppliers. For example, between 2014
and 2017, we reduced the number of suppliers of our brake product (the largest product family that we distribute)
from four to two. Over the 2014 to 2017 period, purchase volumes with brake product suppliers increased by
52%, growing from €21 million to €32 million, while our fees increased by 61%, growing from €10 million to
€16 million. Our offering is also multi-channel, with distribution carried out by a variety of wholly-owned
distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who distribute our products to a variety of
customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail locations and online players. Since the
acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we also benefit from a direct access to end-customers through online
sales of new spare parts from manufacturers and wholesalers. Oscaro offers approximately one million SKUs
across the spare parts universe.

We then use our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and our extensive distribution network to deliver our
products with best-in-class delivery times to more than 70,000 regular professional customers. Our distribution
network is key to our ability to deliver superior product availability and delivery times and we have built a
distribution network that gives us strong coverage and capacity. In France in 2017, we operated the largest
independent, single-branded light vehicle spare parts distribution network and the largest truck spare parts
distribution and service network, with approximately 445 distribution and repair locations overall as of
December 31, 2017.

Our distribution model helps us lower our costs and allows us to stock an extensive range of products with
favorable prices and volumes from our suppliers. This approach also leads to high customer loyalty and gain
market share. On one hand, through our highly efficient logistics platforms and ability to designate single
delivery points, suppliers benefit from cost-efficient access to a highly fragmented customer base which they
would otherwise struggle to address themselves. On the other hand, customers benefit from having access to a
product portfolio that reflects the full range of suppliers and products at competitive prices and from best-in-class
delivery times.

**_A performing operational model supported by an extensive and diversified product and value-added services_**
**_offering_**

We combine our powerful purchasing, logistical and distribution model with an extensive product and
value-added services offering that is tailored to directly address supplier and customer needs then by helping us
promote our brands, strengthen our relationships with suppliers and build customer loyalty. We believe that our
operational model reduces risk due to our broad product and value-added services offering and our multi-channel
approach that provides diversified exposure to a broad and fragmented customer base.

We offer value-added services to our suppliers, including marketing tools, market intelligence, invoicing
and back-office support and online tools. The value-added services that we offer to suppliers generate fees from
those suppliers and the value-added services that we offer to customers increase their loyalty to us, in both cases
providing an additional source of business that complements our product offering. We pursue a multi-channel
approach, distributing products to wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale
distributors who in turn sell to AD-branded garages, independent garages and retail locations. In addition, the
acquisition of Oscaro enabled us to further diversify our business model by developing our online distribution
channel. This approach allows us to address a large, diverse and fragmented customer base, protecting us from
customer concentration and giving us broad access to our addressable market.

We also offer our customers a wide range of value-added services, such as commercial support, training and
technical support, integrated branding, business leads with third-party providers and online tools. As a result of

our combined product and services offering we are a “one-stop” shop to our customers, and we believe this
increases customer loyalty to us. Additionally, unlike many of our competitors, our product range is not limited
to certain OEM or original equipment suppliers (“OES”) parts or to certain types of products. Our product
offering covers approximately 600,000 SKUs across the spare parts universe, including repair and maintenance
parts, body parts, repairer equipment, oil, tires, consumables and accessories. We also offer customers our private
label ISOTECH and Requal product offerings.

In addition, we have several affiliated garage networks, such as AD Expert, AD Carrosserie, Mondial PareBrise, 1, 2, 3 Garages and Auto Primo, which help us diversify our offering. We are able to combine the
significant advantage of having a well-known and trusted core brand with the ability to use affiliated garage
networks to target specific markets. One example of this is the Mondial Pare-Brise brand, which we acquired in
2017. Mondial Pare-Brise is an auto glass repair network that includes 220 franchised windscreen workshops and
70 wholly-owned workshops in France as of December 31, 2017. We have continued to operate Mondial PareBrise under its existing name because the brand is well-known in the French auto glass repair market, which is
complementary to our other offerings. Another example is the Auto Primo brand, which we operate to address
rural and semi-rural repair shops in France. Furthermore, we intend to follow the same approach with Oscaro and
to continue to operate Oscaro under the Oscaro brand.

**_Comprehensive approach to digital solutions_**

Our approach to capturing the advantages created by an increasingly digitalized ecosystem stretches across
every level of our business and we use digital tools to bolster our value-added services offering to suppliers and
customers, expand our product and services offering, address a growing online customer base and digitize our
operational model. The graphic below shows the comprehensive approach we have taken for integrating digital
solutions across our business, before the acquisition of Oscaro.

A number of our services to suppliers and customers are digital or online services, including our B2B online
order portals, such as Autossimo, Truckissimo and Salto, and our e-book, online training offerings (through Grup
Eina) and multi-brand online diagnostic tool (Diag’issimo). Our B2B car repair and maintenance portals increase
the integration of our business with our technical support capacities, helping us increase customer loyalty. We
also offer online tools for our customers’ clientele, such as the ID Garages online portal, which allows drivers to
schedule maintenance appointments, compare prices and receive quotes for work to be performed on their
vehicles. These services and tools enable us to expand our customers’ business.

In addition, we are also poised to capture opportunities in emerging digital product trends, such as
connected devices. One example is our partnership with Oocar, which provides connected platforms for vehicles.
We also plan to offer Auto Connect units for installation in vehicles, which will allow drivers and technicians to
track a vehicle’s systems performance remotely in real time through connected devices, and to use connected
devices to collect and compile data to continue serving drivers.

We are also positioned to benefit from the increasing importance of the digital marketplace, which is the
fastest growing independent aftermarket distribution channel with an estimated 18% average annual growth rate
between 2010 and 2017. Web dealers are already part of our customer base, accounting for €101 million in

118


-----

revenue in 2017. We have made deep and long-standing investments in our online customers to better serve this
growing channel, offering dedicated platforms, such as Doyen Auto and ACR. Following the acquisition of
Oscaro, the leader in online sales of light vehicle spare parts in France, we have become a truly “omni-channel”
distributor in France, benefiting from an increasing online presence through Oscaro’s approximately 2.5 million
customers and approximately €325 million of sales for the year ending December 31, 2017.

**_Demonstrated ability to deliver organic growth supported by a prudent and synergistic acquisition strategy_**

With over 55 years of experience in our industry, we have built the relationships, infrastructure and
know-how that we believe are critical to success in the Western European light vehicle and truck IAMs. This is
reflected in our strong organic growth. Our revenue grew from €914 million in the year ended December 31,
2014, to €1.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017, representing average organic growth of
approximately 3% per annum over the 2014 to 2017 period. Over the same period, profitability also grew. In the
year ended December 31, 2014, Adjusted EBITDA was €67 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.3%. In
the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA increased to €118 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin
was 9.4%. We benefit from a number of growth-compounding and profitability levers that we believe will
continue to help us improve our EBITDA. Our growth-compounding levers include our continued organic
growth and expansion in Western Europe.

Our organic growth has been supported by various factors, such as our new distribution model (which has
bolstered our offering to customers, thus leading to market share gains), our exposure to fast-growing channels
(such as web dealers), our successful recruiting of new branded garages, the development of our private-label
offers, improved purchasing conditions obtained through our supplier concentration strategy and our network
optimization strategy which is focused on cost-control. In recent years we have demonstrated stable organic
growth overall, particularly in the resilient light vehicle IAM, as a result of good purchasing conditions with
suppliers, network rationalization, recruitment of approximately 100 AD branded garages (net) per year from
2010 to 2017 with a churn rate of less than 5% and the disposal of non-core assets. Our model is based in part on
the delivery of value-added services to both suppliers and customers. These value-added services not only
generate fees from suppliers but also promote loyalty from customers, helping us grow our market share.

In addition, we have a strong track record of pursuing value-enhancing acquisitions and successfully
realizing synergies with such targets. In the past seven years, we have made thirteen sizeable acquisitions
(including Verviers Freins and Oscaro). We acquired approximately €700 million in revenue through acquisitions
since 2012 (of which Gobillot Rhône accounted for approximately €70 million in revenues, Rougon Queyrel and
FPLS collectively accounted for approximately €45 million, ACR accounted for approximately €100 million,
Doyen Auto and Automax collectively accounted for approximately €200 million, the 2017 acquisitions of ADB,
OVAM, Top Car, Ricauto and Mondial Pare-Brise collectively accounted for approximately €160 million and the
2018 acquisitions of Geevers and G-Group collectively accounted for an annualized revenue of approximately
€125 million), without taking into account the recent acquisitions of Verviers Freins and Oscaro.

Each of these acquisitions has been supported by a strategy centered on four pillars: consolidating our
leadership in countries where we are present (the 2013 acquisition of FPLS), expanding into new countries (the
2016 acquisition of Doyen Auto, the 2017 acquisition of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car in Italy and the 2018
acquisitions of Geevers (Benelux), G-Group (Italy) and Verviers Freins (Benelux)), acquiring complementary
businesses to enrich our value proposition (the 2017 acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise, a French auto glass repair
network) and expanding our digital exposure (the 2014 acquisition of ACR, the 2016 acquisition of Doyen Auto
and the 2018 acquisition of Oscaro).

In recent acquisitions, we have focused closely on seeking revenue synergies (rolling out our value
proposition fundamentals such as our private label product offerings, garage concept and customer services),
margin synergies (leveraging price and volume effects and supply chain cross-fertilization) and costs synergies
(rationalizing central and support function costs), putting particular emphasis on targets with highly identifiable
synergies. Our acquisitions have demonstrated favorable pre- and post-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiples
(calculated as enterprise value divided by EBITDA):

   - _ACR: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as compared with post-synergy_
multiple of approximately 3.5x, reflecting approximately €10 million in run-rate purchasing synergies;

   - _Doyen-Auto: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 12x, as compared with post-_
synergy multiple of approximately 5x, reflecting approximately €12 million in run-rate purchasing
synergies;

119


-----

   - _Mondial Pare-Brise: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 9x, as compared with_
post-synergy multiple of approximately 6x, reflecting approximately €1 million in run-rate purchasing
synergies; and

   - _OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as_
compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 5x, reflecting approximately €7 million in
run-rate purchasing synergies.

In addition, our acquisitions completed in 2018 have demonstrated EBITDA post-synergy multiples
between 4x and 7x.

Our acquisitions have also demonstrated our ability to grow revenue and EBITDA following an acquisition.
For example, following our acquisition of ACR in 2014, at which point our revenue was approximately
€75 million and our EBITDA was approximately €6 million, ACR benefited from more than €4 million in
organic growth and more than €10 million in synergies were realized, leading to revenue of approximately
€117 million and EBITDA of approximately €20 million in 2017. Similarly, following our acquisition of Doyen
Auto in 2015, at which point our revenue was approximately €190 million and our EBITDA was approximately
€7 million, Doyen Auto benefited from more than €1 million in organic growth and more than €12 million in
synergies were realized, leading to revenue of approximately €197 million and EBITDA of approximately
€20 million in 2017.

Our profitability drivers include our favorable purchasing conditions, integrated logistics model and the
ongoing optimization of our network. Our long-term relationships and significant purchasing power have enabled
us to negotiate favorable purchasing conditions with our suppliers, improving our margin on the products we
purchase, while our integrated logistics model has helped us reduce costs and increase margins. Likewise, our
efforts in recent years to rationalize and optimize our distribution network has helped us not only improve lead
times and customer service but also to reduce costs and increase margins.

**_A strong financial profile delivering an attractive combination of resilient growth, margin improvement, low_**
**_capital expenditure and high cash conversion_**

Since 2014, we have grown our revenue from €914 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to
€969 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, €1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016, and
€1.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017. This reflects a CAGR of 11.1% between the years ended
December 31, 2014, and 2017, with growth at 5.9%, 5.4% and 23.1% in the years ended December 31, 2015,
2016 and 2017, respectively, of which average organic growth was approximately 3% per annum over the 2014
to 2017 period and accounted for 3.5%, 2.8% and 2.1% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively.

We increased our Adjusted EBITDA from €67 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, to €83 million,
€93 million and €118 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, representing
Adjusted EBITDA growth of 24.6%, 11.4% and 27.4% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2017, which illustrates the effects
that acquisitions would have had if such acquisitions had taken effect on January 1, 2017 and excluding certain
items recorded in 2017 that we consider as being not reflective of our ongoing operating performance, was
€131.0 million. We increased our Adjusted EBITDA margin from 7.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 to
8.6%, 9.1% and 9.4% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

We operate a business model that requires a relatively low capital expenditure, using rented facilities
without needing to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the year ended December 31, 2017,
our capital expenditures amounted to 2.1% of our revenue (excluding Logisteo) and consisted of maintenance
expenditures for our distribution facilities and upgrades to our sales and warehouse IT management systems. Our
low level of capital expenditures has been stable in recent years, with capital expenditure for the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, at 2.0%, 2.3% and 2.1% of revenue, respectively (in each case excluding
Logisteo). Our low levels of maintenance capital expenditure requirements have allowed us to invest in our
business in order to maintain our leading market positions and improve operating efficiency, as well as achieve
deleveraging through EBITDA growth and cash generation.

Our cash conversion rate (which is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, net of Adjusted capital expenditure,
divided by Adjusted EBITDA) was 78% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, as compared with
73%, 76% and 78% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. This growth has been
supported by the implementation of a series of profit enhancing measures, including the continual negotiation of

120


-----

good purchasing conditions with suppliers, network rationalization, the disposal of non-core assets and
realization of acquisition synergies.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsor_**

We operate under the stewardship of an experienced and successful management team with a proven track
record in European B2B distribution and international expansion, coupled with a supportive sponsor. Our CEO,
Mr. Stéphane Antiglio, and CFO, Mr. Christophe Gouthière, have a proven track record in developing and
implementing turnaround and growth strategies. Mr. Stéphane Antiglio is the former CEO of Pomona Passion
Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Mr. Christophe Gouthière was previously European CFO
of the Dole Group, a leading distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our CEO and CFO are supported by an
experienced management team and, together, they have successfully implemented profit improvement initiatives
and integrated thirteen new businesses into the Group in the last seven years. For example, our management team
successfully integrated ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in 2016, realizing higher purchasing and cost savings and
revenue enhancements than those identified at the time ACR and Doyen Auto were acquired. Our management
team has also delivered consistent organic growth while expanding margins, rolling out the implementation of
Logisteo and pursuing successful expansion into new geographies, products and channels. We believe that the
success of our management team in completing our profit improvement plan and returning our business to
profitable growth since 2010 has laid a solid foundation for further growth and increased profitability. The
support, investment experience and sector expertise of our sponsor, Bain Capital, supplement the leadership and
expertise of our management team.

**Our strategy**

Our strategy is to continue growing organically by leveraging our history of operational excellence that
focuses on offering a superior supplier and customer experience, to become the key consolidator in the
fragmented markets in which we operate by using our proven approach to M&A and to develop our online
segment and our position as a fully multi-channel player.

In terms of organic growth, we intend to grow revenues and continue to outperform the markets in which we
operate by continuing to apply and enhance our operational model based on a fully-integrated supply chain and
the distinctive suite of value-added digital and commercial services that we offer to our customers and suppliers.
We are in the process of optimizing this model and have a clear vision for ongoing improvements that are
designed to adapt our business to our evolving markets. In particular, we intend to capitalize on our value-added
services in order to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, increase customer loyalty and gain market
share.

In terms of M&A-led growth, we are focused on improving Adjusted EBITDA in terms of absolute value as
well as in terms of Adjusted EBITDA margin. In order to do this, we will put increasing focus on executing
value-accretive M&A transactions and successfully and efficiently integrating acquired businesses into the
Group.

In terms of our multi-channel approach, we intend to leverage the acquisition of Oscaro to continue to grow
our online product offering in France and in other markets and to strengthen our position in the B2C (DIY)
segment.

**_Continue integrating our upstream supply chain to solidify our market-leading position and expand margins_**

We operate a fully-integrated supply chain that connects our strategically concentrated group of suppliers to
our CPUs and state-of-the-art logistics platforms, through to an extensive distribution network that serves more
than 70,000 customers with deliveries several times per day and with best-in-class delivery times. We intend to
build on our history of operational excellence by continuing to integrate and rationalize our supply chain. We
believe this approach will help us maintain and further enhance our strong and unique positioning as a central
distribution intermediary for all value chain levels and to reinforce our role as an important link between parts
suppliers and customers. Based on the value that we have extracted from operational improvements in recent
years, we believe that continual improvements to our supply chain will contribute to increased market share and
expanded margins.

We believe that our supply chain is key to our success because it helps us offer unique advantages to our
suppliers. For example, our increasing use of centralized, automated platforms simplifies suppliers own delivery
processes by offering a single delivery point. We believe that this single delivery point approach is a significant
and attractive advantage for our suppliers. We also offer suppliers a range of innovative value-added services

121


-----

such as marketing tools and intelligence, online support tools, payment guarantees and a centralized invoicing
system with simplified back office support, all of which help suppliers grow their own business while creating
greater efficiencies through simplified tracking, delivery, monitoring and payment solutions. We believe that
these services represent advantages that are a “win-win” proposition for us and our suppliers, differentiating us
from our competitors.

In addition, we are pursuing increased integration of our supply chain, which is based on two flows of spare
parts: a “direct delivery flow” from suppliers to distributors and a “platform-based flow” through our logistics
platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2017, 62% of our products were distributed via our platform-based
flow, as compared with 18% in 2010, representing a marked improvement that we intend to pursue by further
developing our platform-based flow. This approach is expected to drive improved product availability and
delivery times while generating favorable financial conditions for us, due in part to the higher logistics fees
which we can apply in this context, and which we expect will lead to higher margins, as the logistics fees
received from suppliers generally exceed the related costs of operating the logistics platforms. This is particularly
applicable to our new, automated platforms, such as Logisteo, because these platforms generally offer a doubled
capacity for SKU stockage as well as doubled processing capacity, allowing us to offer more SKUs from a wider
range of product lines and suppliers. We will pursue this strategy by encouraging new suppliers to make
deliveries through the platform flow from the outset as well as by having existing supplies expand the breadth of
their range offered through our platform-based flow.

**_Continue concentrating supplier relationships in order to optimize purchasing conditions with key suppliers_**
**_and expanding our private label offerings, to increase profitable growth_**

We are currently implementing a supplier concentration strategy by which we have rationalized our supplier
relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260 in 2018. This approach
has allowed us to further improve our negotiating leverage with suppliers, driving more favorable purchasing
terms and increased volumes, while maintaining a sufficient number of suppliers to avoid undue reliance on
particular suppliers. Additionally, we are often a key client of our major suppliers, further increasing our
negotiating leverage.

This approach has already enabled us to concentrate a significant number of our purchasing relationships but
there remain certain product families and products that we continue to source from multiple suppliers. As a
result, we see further opportunities to concentrate our supply flows and plan to select no more than two or three
suppliers per product or sub-category of product in the near future. We expect that this strategy will continue to
enhance purchasing conditions for us, which in turn will improve product availability and profitability.

In addition, we intend to continue expanding our private label offerings, such as ISOTECH and Requal, in
both new geographies as well as the countries in which we already operate. We benefit from more attractive
margins on ISOTECH products as compared with third-party branded products. As a result, our expansion
strategy for our private label offerings is expected to optimize production costs, while increasing volumes sold
per SKU and allowing us to negotiate improved purchasing conditions with the suppliers of these products, in
turn leading to profitable growth through margin expansion.

**_Build on improved distribution models in both light vehicle and trucks to continue growing market share_**

In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution models for our Light Vehicle
France and Trucks segments, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic
investments in our automated logistics platforms. Through this strategy, we aim to improve operational
efficiency, enhance customer service, cover multiple regions with the use of small pivot sites, rationalize flows
and optimize inventory and warehousing, reflecting a focus on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the
regional level, while maintaining excellent delivery times.

For example, since 2014, we have redesigned and refined our Light Vehicle France distribution model,
moving from a large number of delivery sites acting as intermediaries between suppliers and our logistics
platforms and garage customers, to a more precisely deployed network of pivot sites that connects suppliers and
our logistics platforms with proximity and delivery sites, which are strategically located to address customer
demand. A key component of this strategy is our ongoing efforts to grow our affiliated network of garages. We
expect that our new model will improve distributor performance with optimized inventory levels and SKU
availability and an increased ability to adapt our offer to local customer requirements, leading to an enhanced
customer experience. We continue to seek ways to optimize our operation and believe that in the current, second
phase of this operational re-design, which will be focused on fine-tuning the light vehicle distribution model, we

122


-----

can further improve delivery times, quality of service and availability of products, each of which are expected to
help us gain greater market share in the geographies where we operate.

In our Trucks segment, we are also focused on operational improvement and have begun implementing a
new distribution model, which is expected to be fully rolled out by mid-2019. The new distribution model for the
Trucks segment aims to grow our network of affiliated garages and to reconfigure our current network of 130
distribution sites to be organized around 12 regional warehouses focused on distribution to local sites, owned and
independent garages and integrated workshops. We believe that our new distribution model for our Trucks
segment will lead to better availability of our wide range of SKUs, allowing us to better utilize our large network
and unique range of value-added services to meet customer demand. For example, with our new Trucks
distribution model, we believe we will be the only player in the French truck spare parts market able to serve our
full range of customers with twice daily deliveries made within four hours.

**_Expand our value-added services offering to customers, further differentiating the customer experience and_**
**_driving customer loyalty_**

We have developed an innovative and unique suite of value-added services for our customers, including
best-in-class delivery times, commercial support, training and technical support, a strong commercial concept
with integrated branding, business leads to key third-party providers and a wide variety of online and digital
tools. We believe that the variety and quality of the value-added services that we offer to customers increase
customer loyalty in part because such services help embed us within their customers operations, making us a key
partner in our customers’ success. In addition, this varied suite of value-added services also enable us to serve a
wide and diverse customer base with a wide range of evolving needs and demands.

Our digital services are a key factor that differentiate us from our competitors. We intend to continue
growing our digital offering in order to capitalize on this competitive advantage. For example, in November
2018, we acquired Oscaro, the leading online seller of light vehicle spare parts in France. This strategic
acquisition strengthened our online distribution channel and allowed us to become an “omni-channel”
aftermarket spare parts distributor in France.

In addition, we have developed proprietary B2B online tools to support our customers with state-of-the-art
online ordering capabilities, such as our proprietary online portals, Autossimo and Truckissimo. Our online
ordering portals improve our customers’ experience by offering a user-friendly portal for garages to search
through a large selection of spare parts, directly order parts online and obtain technical information about those
parts. In 2017, one-third of French garages were Autossimo customers, demonstrating the wide appeal of these
portals. Our online tools enhance integration, increasing customer loyalty and wallet share while reducing call
center and other related costs. We have also created ID Garages to increase visibility of our branded garages. ID
Garages is a website that allows customers to locate and compare garages and schedule service appointments
online. It is a “win-win” solution for us, as we retain a percentage of the fee quote, and for our garage customers,
who collect fees from business gained through the portal. We estimate that ID Garages has generated
approximately €700,000 in subscriptions and fees for us and generated approximately €4.2 million of revenue for
our garage customers in the year ended December 31, 2017.

We aim to constantly innovate by offering new and improved services and tools and using existing tools to
create future growth. For example, we intend to expand our ID Garages offering into Benelux and Italy, with the
goal of doubling the number of subscribers, increasing revenues derived from this service and becoming a key
reference in online bookings. We also intend to extend our partnerships with third parties such as insurers and
fleets and to expand our innovative AD Connect offering. In addition, we have started to reinforce our
partnership with Grup Eina, a strong technical platform that offers customers valuable training opportunities.

**_Continue optimizing our distribution network_**

We believe that our extensive distribution network is important to our present and continued success. In
order to preserve and expand this advantage profitably, we employ a cost-conscious approach to managing our
distribution network, constantly focusing on improving network efficiency and breadth of coverage, while
minimizing or eliminating redundancies wherever possible. For example, in our light vehicle business, we are
currently focused on ongoing upgrades to our real estate parc and improvements to the size and coverage of our
footprint of distribution sites in France. When and where necessary, we remodel, close or consolidate sites. We
also work to lower and rationalize downstream logistics costs by maximizing the square footage of our sites and
by modernizing our logistics and monitoring functions, such as through the increased use of bar coding and the
creation of a dedicated logistics department. In our Trucks business, we are implementing an improvement plan

123


-----

that is focused on closing low- and non-performing sites in the context of a broader profit-focused effort to
optimize our distribution network.

**_Continue to grow our footprint with entries into neighboring countries and expansion in existing countries_**

In recent years, we have implemented a number of successful acquisitions, demonstrating the strength and
rigor of our prudent M&A process. This M&A process is centered around careful evaluation of potential targets,
which are usually selected from local leaders that offer significant purchasing synergies. Through strategic
acquisitions, we have penetrated new geographies, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Doyen Auto, which
allowed us to expand into Benelux, as well as broaden our reach or product offering in the countries in which we
already operate, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise, which allowed us to offer a full range
of windscreen replacement products in France. In addition, through the acquisition of Oscaro in France, we have
penetrated the B2C (DIY) segment and strengthened our position in the e-commerce market. We have started to
implement the following initiatives to bring back Oscaro’s sales and profitability to normalized levels: (i) put in
place an interim management team with full control on the operations of the business, who have already started
to deliver our profitability improvement plan for Oscaro, (ii) the payment of supplier overdues and client refunds,
which we aim to finalize during the first quarter of 2019, (iii) various cost-saving measures, including the
carve-out of non-core activities, change of service provider and renegotiation of transportation costs, as well as
some pre-identified savings on consulting fees and the rationalization of international activities, (iv) negotiations
with suppliers in order to optimize purchasing terms and conditions, which we aim to finalize during the first half
of 2019 and (v) sales improvement through customers reimbursements to improve customer satisfaction,
ensuring that the full assortment of spare parts is available, online and offline marketing strategy and branding
campaigns.

We intend to continue making strategic, value-accretive acquisitions in the near term as well as in the
medium term, including in certain geographies adjacent to the countries in which we operate. We intend to focus
on new geographies where the car parcs are similar enough to those in which we are already active to realize
synergies and where we can effectively use our logistics platforms and distribution networks. We also intend to
consolidate our leadership in the countries where we are already present, building on areas of strength and taking
advantage of the fragmented nature of these markets. We also have set a goal of continuing to grow our market
share in France, maintaining and strengthening our leading position in both the light vehicle and truck IAMs.

**_Maintain a positive social environment to recruit and retain talent by focusing on development opportunities_**

We believe that attracting and retaining talented people is critical to our success and believe that the key to
attracting and retaining talented employees is offering development and growth opportunities in the context of a
positive social environment. We intend to maintain our strong corporate culture with a human resources strategy
that focuses on creating and sustaining an experienced, motivated and stable workforce. In order to do this, our
human resources strategy is, and will continue to be, organized around four pillars: (i) successful talent
recruitment, supported by marketing events, educational collaborations and digital initiatives, (ii) development of
employees through training partnerships, e-learning and talent appraisal and evaluation processes, (iii) a costefficient approach to benefits through payroll monitoring, unified compensation policies and favorable social
protection schemes and (iv) the development of a positive social environment through continuous improvement
of working conditions, investments in work spaces and workforce rationalization.

**History**

We were founded in 1962 to formalize the cooperation among a number of existing independent light
vehicle aftermarket distributors and quickly became a key operator in France, providing a link between original
equipment suppliers and spare parts suppliers on the one hand, and garages, local spare parts distributors, body
shops, fast-fitters and car centers on the other hand. In 1983, we expanded our footprint throughout France, both
at the distributor level and the garage level, by forming our network of wholly-owned distributors and in 1985,
rolling out our concept of a network of branded garages that comprised key customers that operate independently
from the Group. We launched our truck business in 1988 to supply spare parts for trucks, tractors and trailers. We
were the first independent distributor network of spare parts for trucks in France.

We have continued expanding our logistics platforms, distribution network and our products and services
offering in France through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. For example, we enhanced our logistics
platforms and expanded our offering to include body parts through the acquisitions of Cora, a leading
independent French distributor of light vehicle parts for collision repair in 2005, and Bremstar, a distributor with

124


-----

a logistics platform dedicated to truck parts for maintenance and repair, in 2008. Between 2012 and 2017, we
acquired a number of French light vehicle and truck distributors including Gobillot Rhône (previously
Ensemble), FPLS, Rougon Queyrel, Electro Diesel Service, ADB, API Marne, API Aube and acquired a minority
stake in Société Lyonnaise de Pneumatiques et Accessoires. In 2017, we purchased Mondial Pare-Brise, a French
auto glass repair network expanding into a product range that complements our existing offering and in 2018 we
purchased Oscaro, a French online distributor of light vehicle spare parts. We also distribute our own private
label product offerings, ISOTECH (rolled out in 2001) and Requal, which features spare parts, such as batteries,
brake pads, lubricants, water pumps and headlights.

We have also expanded into complementary channels and to address new customer bases. For example, we
have progressively enhanced our online offering. We created the Autossimo online B2B light vehicle repair and
maintenance web portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online B2B truck repair and maintenance web portal in
2001. As another example, in 2014, we acquired ACR, a specialized distributor in France of light vehicle spare
parts and, in 2016, acquired Doyen Auto, a Belgium-headquartered distributor of aftermarket light vehicle spare
parts, enabling us to become a leading distributor to online players, as well as expanding our platform to serve
our key customers. In 2017, we acquired Grup Eina, allowing us to expand our digital technical support offerings
and acquired a minority stake in Oocar, allowing us to expand our offering of connectivity and mobility
solutions. More recently, we created www.idgarages.com, which allows customers to locate and compare garages
and schedule service appointments online, and has developed our relationships with web dealers. We also expect
the acquisition of Oscaro to help develop our international presence, as we intend to roll out Oscaro’s online
sales platform to other countries in which we operate.

We also have a long history of successfully acquiring and integrating strategically selected targets in
adjacent geographic markets. In 2007, our previous shareholder introduced the business into the Polish market by
purchasing three local distributors that operated as the key distributors for our Polish subsidiary, AD Polska. In
August 2017, our current management made a strategic exit from the Polish market as part of our network
rationalization strategy, divesting AD Polska to Rhiag Group. In 2017, we entered the Italian market with the
creation of a joint company, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., with three Italian distributors, OVAM, Top Car and
Ricauto, and in 2018, we acquired G-Group, an independent spare parts distributor in Italy. In 2016, we acquired
the Doyen Auto Group, allowing us to expand into Benelux and in 2018 we acquired Geevers and Verviers
Freins, further expanding our operations in Benelux.

We have also developed and implemented operating strategies designed to increase our revenue, reduce our
leverage, costs and capital expenditures and improve margins. These strategies include the introduction of a new
management team in 2010, the implementation of a profit improvement plan, the revision of distributor margins
and the rollout of fully-integrated logistics platforms such as Logisteo. For example, we have revisited our
previous centralized approach and have now implemented a transparent model with a rationalized distribution
network, which has led to higher customer loyalty.

We were acquired by our current principal shareholder, Bain Capital, in 2015. Since 2015, we have
diversified and internationalized our business with new product and channel offerings and expansions into
adjacent geographies.

**_Verviers Freins acquisition_**

On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Verviers Freins by our subsidiary Doyen Auto.
Verviers Freins is a Belgian multi-brand distributor of mechanical parts, bodywork, paint, tools and garage
equipment and was established in 1967. Verviers Freins operates in the Liège region and in eastern Belgium and
employs approximately 100 people in eight sale outlets. Verviers Freins has a long-standing relation with Doyen
Auto and is an active member of the API network, running approximately 20 1,2,3 Autoservice garages.

The acquisition was financed by drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. In the year ended
December 31, 2017, Verviers Freins generated a consolidated revenue of €21 million. We believe that the
acquisition of Verviers Freins will strengthen our market position in Benelux and generate significant synergies
in terms of logistics and commercial development.

**_Oscaro acquisition_**

In July 2018, we acquired a 4.95% ownership stake in Oscaro for consideration of €10 million. On
November 13, 2018, we increased our total ownership stake in Oscaro to 82.49% for incremental consideration
of approximately €80 million, which included a capital investment of approximately €55 million in Oscaro. We

125


-----

financed the acquisition of Oscaro with drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Indenoï, the holding
company of Oscaro’s founder Pierre-Noël Luiggi, will retain a share of up to approximately 17.5% in Oscaro.
Mr. Luiggi will not continue to hold any operational role in the company.

Oscaro is an independent online distributor of light vehicle spare parts and was established in 2001. It is the
leader in online sales of light vehicle spare parts in France, which is the fastest growing independent aftermarket
distribution channel, and has an online market share of approximately 50% in France based on online sales.
Oscaro’s e-commerce platform allows car owners to buy automotive parts online from a range of manufacturers,
without going through automotive dealers. Oscaro’s product offering includes new spare parts from
manufacturers and wholesalers which include Bosch, Continental, Contiteck, Luk, SKF, TRW and Valeo, and we
have been one of the key spare parts suppliers of Oscaro. Oscaro generates revenue primarily from its B2C (DIY)
segment and operates mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in other markets such as Spain. Oscaro served
approximately 2.5 million customers in 2017, received approximately 345,000 orders a month and had a portfolio
of approximately 1 million SKUs.

Oscaro generated revenue of approximately €325 million and a negative EBITDA of approximately
€18 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, with a gross margin of approximately 30%. As of
September 30, 2018, Oscaro had €12.0 million of third-party borrowings outstanding under bilateral facilities and
finance leases, which we acquired in connection with the acquisition.

Since the completion of the acquisition, we have started to implement the following initiatives to bring back
Oscaro’s sales and profitability to normalized levels: (i) put in place an interim management team with full
control on the operations of the business, who have already started to deliver our profitability improvement plan
for Oscaro, (ii) the payment of supplier overdues and client refunds, which we aim to finalize during the first
quarter of 2019, (iii) various cost-saving measures, including the carve-out of non-core activities, change of
service provider and renegotiation of transportation costs, as well as some pre-identified savings on consulting
fees and the rationalization of international activities, (iv) negotiations with suppliers in order to optimize
purchasing terms and conditions, which we aim to finalize during the first half of 2019 and (v) sales
improvement through customers reimbursements to improve customer satisfaction, ensuring that the full
assortment of spare parts is available, online and offline marketing strategy and branding campaigns. We expect
to realize approximately €15 million of cost savings from optimization measures, including the rationalization of
non-core entities, and approximately €15 million purchasing synergies, resulting from Oscaro purchasing spare
parts under our existing arrangements with suppliers, which provide for better commercial terms. These savings
initiatives are expected to be implemented over the next 14 to 18 months and the implementation is expected to
cost approximately €10 million.

**Our operational model**

Our operational model is centered around four components: procurement and suppliers, upstream logistics
control, local distribution and customers, as shown in the graphic below.

**_Procurement and suppliers_**

Our procurement strategy is organized around suppliers, our CPUs and our private label offerings,
ISOTECH and Requal.

_Central purchasing units_

Our CPUs buy aftermarket spare parts, equipment and tools from suppliers. We use our CPUs to monitor
customer purchases across our network and to adjust our product portfolio in order to meet customer demand.
We seek to buy in large quantities so that the savings made by buying in bulk offset the costs associated with
maintaining inventories at our warehouses.

127


-----

Our CPUs have a proven track record of margin expansion and purchasing synergies, as shown in the
graphic below.

_Suppliers_

Our key suppliers are OESs. We have cultivated long-term relationships with approximately 260 suppliers.
Our suppliers are geographically diversified, based across France (Valeo), Italy (Filtrauto), Germany (Bosch,
Knorr-Bremse and Schaeffler), Sweden (SKF) and the United States (Gates, Tenneco and TRW Automotive).
This approach to sourcing allows us to cover the full portfolio of products that our customers seek, while
retaining control over our relationships with suppliers and optimizing our sourcing across multiple countries.

Our leading market position, large-scale operations, large purchasing volumes and centralized purchasing
approach provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates and fees with
our suppliers. These rebates and fees lower the purchase price we pay by 15% to 20% and include service and
logistics fees charged by us to suppliers as well as end-of-year volume rebates, strategic rebates and ADI rebates
applied by suppliers. For example, our logistical capabilities enable suppliers to make deliveries to a single point,
allowing us to charge suppliers logistics fees which are generally greater than the logistics costs that we incur.
Moreover, we benefit from a competitive pricing policy in relation to suppliers, the price of spare parts being
indexed to that of equivalent OEM spare parts and thus reflecting inflation.

Suppliers also benefit from their relationship with us, which provides them with increased volumes and
offers a number of value-added services, in exchange for a fee, as well as unique access to our customer base.
The fees paid by suppliers constitute approximately 15% to 20% of the total fees received from suppliers.

The services that we offer to our suppliers are focused on improving these suppliers’ efficiency and
promoting their products and include:

   - Marketing tools: we offer information about suppliers’ products to customers and promote suppliers’
products, including in connection with new product launches.

   - Online support: we include references to suppliers’ products in our online portals (such as Autossimo,
Truckissimo and Salto), which help increase brand and product awareness for suppliers and generate
orders.

   - Invoicing and back-office support: we offer a central ordering, purchasing and invoicing system and
suppliers benefit from having a single invoicing counterparty and from payment guarantees.

   - Market intelligence: we give suppliers access to our market data.

In addition to the services described above, we also give our suppliers access to ADI, a purchasing group of
aftermarket distributors, which we founded. ADI has 24 members, of which we are the leader, accounting for

128


**+  41m**


-----

25% of purchases, while the second largest member accounts for 15% of purchases. In 2017, ADI generated
€6.5 billion in revenue and was present in 39 countries. ADI works with 40 suppliers, 600 distributors (who have
access to 3,000 distribution outlets) and 4,500 AD-branded garages across 12 countries. ADI benefits members
by giving them enhanced negotiating power with major suppliers, allowing them to operate under a common
brand, enabling them to share know-how and offering support services such as diagnostic tools and a technical
hotline. ADI benefits suppliers by giving them access to an international network of distributors with high sales
volumes and extensive customer coverage, giving such suppliers high levels of visibility into the market.

In 2017, we worked with 242 main suppliers (as compared with 293 suppliers in 2010) and our top ten
suppliers (Bosch, Schaeffler, Filtrauto, Federal Mogul, Gates, Valeo, Facom, Tenneco, SKF and TRW
Automotive) provided 45% of our products by volume (as compared with 35% in 2010). In 2017, our top
supplier provided 12% of our products by volume and no supplier other than the top supplier provided more than
5% of our products by volume. We are one of the top three clients of Bosch and Schaeffler and are Filtrauto’s
number one client.

We select our suppliers via tender procedures for each product category that we distribute. When selecting
our suppliers, we take into account the quality and price of the spare parts or products, as well as the supplier’s
ability to deliver items within the deadlines required. For example, we select our brake and battery suppliers
every three years. We generally enter into annually renewable contracts with our suppliers, which include
standard terms and conditions, such as supply specifications regarding lead time, frequency of deliveries,
packaging and performance target and rebates.

_Private label offerings_

In addition to our procurement activities described above, we distribute products from our own private label
offerings, ISOTECH and Requal, whom we source from manufacturers to which we subcontract production.

ISOTECH is a high quality product line we relaunched in 2008, which offered approximately 3,500 SKUs
for the light vehicle aftermarket as well as truck parts for maintenance and repair in 2017. ISOTECH’s product
offering is focused on the older part of the car parc and truck fleet (i.e. vehicles aged over eight years) and
ISOTECH’s offering is comprehensive, covering most of the needs of the car parc. We offer competitive pricing
on ISOTECH products to customers by giving a discount to prevailing market prices. Despite these lower prices,
we benefit from more attractive margins on ISOTECH products as compared with third-party branded products.
Additionally, the ISOTECH product line serves a strategic response to certain of the pricing pressures created by
web dealers. The penetration rate of the ISOTECH offering has been growing steadily. In 2015, we expanded the
ISOTECH offering to include equipment, which we source from Asia, while carefully monitoring product quality
and lead times. Revenue from ISOTECH equipment has grown substantially since the creation of the offering,
reaching €3.2 million in 2017 compared to €0.6 million in 2015. In 2017, ISOTECH products represented
approximately 10% of our total sales and approximately 15% of our light vehicle sales in France.

Requal is a product line of light vehicle spare parts, such as brake pads and wiper parts, that is focused on
price- competitive products for cars aged four years and older. We acquired the Requal brand in connection with
our acquisition of the Doyen Auto Group in 2016.

**_Upstream logistics control_**

The flow of products purchased by our CPUs is mainly managed by our logistics platforms. Our upstream
logistics control model is state-of-the-art, featuring automated central warehouses that have enabled us to reduce
costs while improving product availability and delivery times. Our logistics platforms have the following key
responsibilities:

   - _Inbound logistics: accepting incoming products from suppliers and monitoring compliance with_
negotiated specifications.

   - _Stocking: determining the shelf space to be allocated to each product and shelf placement in accordance_
with turnover indices and product size. The proper placement of products within the dedicated space is
crucial to optimize available space.

   - _Picking, packing and outbound logistics: space management allows us to maximize efficiency in_
locating and retrieving products from the shelves and assembling orders of outgoing products. If
products have not been previously packaged by the suppliers, our logistics platforms are able to carry
out this activity.

   - _Shipping: organizing and monitoring transportation._

129


-----

Our logistical operations include two flows of spare parts: a direct delivery flow from suppliers to
distributors and a platform-based flow through our logistics platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2017,
62% of our products were distributed via our platform-based flow, as compared with 18% in 2010. Our strategy
is to further develop the platform-based flow because it drives improved product availability and delivery times
and leads to favorable financial conditions for us, such as higher logistics fees applied by our suppliers.

The transport of products from our logistics platforms to our distribution network is carried out through
independent carriers. Our logistics department is responsible for setting performance targets and related
incentives and penalties for third-party carriers, while continuously monitoring the performance of carriers in
order to improve customer service. We plan and monitor product flows through our IT systems. We lease, rather
than own, most of our logistics platforms, thereby limiting our permanent investment in fixed assets.

Our Light Vehicle France segment is serviced by three logistics platforms: Logisteo (our automated
warehouse), ACR (focused on key accounts and online customers) and Cora (focused on light vehicle body parts
for collision repair). Our Light Vehicle International segment is serviced by two logistics platforms: Doyen Auto
(covering Belgium and the Netherlands as well as certain online customers) and OVAM/Ricauto (covering Italy).
Our Trucks segment is serviced by one logistics platform, Bremstar.

**_Local distribution_**

Our local distribution model includes wholly-owned distributors (“wholly-owned distributors”) and
independent distributors affiliated with us (“affiliated independent distributors”), as well as local wholesalers
who are not affiliated with us and online players.

Our distribution network in France is dense and allows us to offer customers premium solutions and
services. In the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket, our dense distribution network enables us to
keep products close to customers and make up to six deliveries per day to most customers. As a result,
distributors are able to provide their customers with best-in-class delivery lead times, with deliveries to garages
generally able to be made in under two hours when necessary, deliveries to key accounts generally able to be
made in under two hours when necessary or one business day and deliveries to web dealers generally able to be
made within four hours or one business day. The density of our local distribution network also gives us the
ability to negotiate with key accounts at a national level.

The map below shows our distribution locations in France, with a focus on the French Alps region to
demonstrate how we deploy a mix of regional hubs, local distribution sites and proximity collection sites.

As of December 31, 2017, we operated a network of 34 wholly-owned distributors and 53 affiliated
independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out of approximately 360 owned and affiliated
distribution locations as of December 31, 2017 overall, making us the largest independent single-branded light
vehicle spare parts distribution network in France and enabling us to cover 90% of customer demand and 90% of
spare parts.

Our contractual arrangements with our affiliated independent distributors include agreements and
commercial contracts, which are negotiated every seven years and which were last renewed on April 13, 2015.
Pursuant to our affiliation agreements, our affiliated independent distributors agree to operate under the
Autodistribution brand and to receive our support services in exchange for a membership fee. Our CPUs enter

130


-----

into commercial contracts with both our wholly-owned distributors and our affiliated independent distributors,
which include the same purchase conditions and volume discounts for both affiliated independent distributors
and wholly-owned distributors. Our affiliated independent distributors receive a loyalty bonus if the purchases
made through our CPUs account for at least 70% of their overall purchase volumes, with an average of 90% of
affiliated independent distributor purchases being made through our CPUs in 2017. Additionally, we pass on a
portion of the rebates we receive from suppliers to our affiliated independent distributors and our wholly-owned
distributors pass on a portion of the rebates to the garages to which they sell. Our wholly-owned and affiliated
independent distributors also benefit from belonging to a single brand. We involve our wholly-owned and
affiliated independent distributors in governance and decision-making through an annual steering committee.

In recent years, we have redesigned our light vehicle France distribution model to improve our operational
efficiency, enhance customer service, cover multiple regions with small regional platforms (“pivot sites”),
rationalize flows and optimize inventory and warehousing, focusing on offering higher availability of more SKUs
at the regional level and with excellent delivery times.

The graphic below compares our light vehicle France distribution model as it operated before 2014 with our
current distribution model.

We are currently making similar changes to the management strategy and distribution model in our Trucks
segment. We have reduced our number of truck spare parts distribution regions to seven (as compared with ten in
2016), by closing certain loss-making locations and merging other locations in order to reduce overlaps. We are
in the process of expanding our AD Poids Lourds-branded garages, having recruited 70 new AD Poids Lourds
garages in the last 24 months, with the objective of reaching 100 AD Poids Lourds garages by the end of 2018
and 250 distribution and repair sites, including 120 AD Poids Lourds garages, by 2019. We are also working to
rationalize our AD Poids Lourds network, and we closed or disposed of ten loss-making sites in the last 24
months. In addition, we are also in the process of redesigning our truck spare parts distribution model, with seven
platforms already deployed and five more expected to be deployed by the end of 2019. The graphic below
compares our truck spare parts distribution model as it operated before 2017 with the distribution model that is
being implemented.

131


-----

Our new truck spare parts distribution model will increase the number of regional warehouses to 12 (as
compared to six in 2017), leading to higher product availability at regional level, stocking 25,000 SKUs
exclusively for trucks.

The redesign of our distribution models is part of a larger project that we have undertaken to modernize our
networks. Other components of this effort include the rationalization and upgrading of our real estate parc, with
the consolidation of the number of locations to 219 in 2017 (excluding recently opened proximity, OTC
locations) (as compared to 230 locations in 2014) and the rationalization of our storage capacity (from
approximately 356,000 square meters in 2014 to approximately 335,000 square meters in 2017), the
modernization of our logistics platforms, with 100% of our platforms now using bar codes for inventory
management and the creation of a dedicated logistics department, and the modernization of our monitoring
systems, with the implementation of performance and operational indicators. The efforts have had a positive
impact, as evidenced by an increase in revenue per employee (from €225,000 per employee in 2014 to €252,000
per employee in 2017).

**_Customers_**

Our local distribution networks distribute parts, equipment and tools to our light vehicle customers,
including garages, body shops, fast-fitters, online operators and integrated workshops, some of which we are
affiliated with (but, in the case of our light vehicle activities, not owned by us) and operate under our brands
(“branded garages”) and others of which are independent (with no formal affiliation with us and sometimes
affiliated with an OEM), as well as our key accounts. Our truck spare parts distribution customers are garages,
certified repairers/agents, integrated workshops and key accounts. Our truck repair and maintenance customers,
served through our wholly-owned garages, are truck fleet owners and operators and integrated workshops.

In 2017, we distributed products to more than 70,000 regular professional customers in France. As of
December 31, 2017, there were 3,197 branded garages in our customer network. In 2017, garages were 45% of
our customer base, followed by wholesalers (28%), retail (8%), online (8%), key accounts (5%). Other customers
represented 6% of our customer base in 2017.

Our principal customers are garages. We distribute products to independent garages (including those that are
affiliated with OEMs) as well as to the AD-branded garages, including AD Expert (with approximately 1,300
points of sale in 2017), AD Poids Lourds (with approximately 250 points of sale in 2017, of which 70 were
wholly-owned by us), AD Carrosserie (primarily serving independent body shops, with approximately 650 points
of sale in 2017), Auto Primo (primarily serving rural and semi-rural repair shops, with approximately 1,000
points of sale in 2017) and Mondial Pare-Brise (offering auto glass repair at approximately 300 locations in
2017). In 2014, sales to mechanical garages represented €189 million of our revenue and in 2017 they
represented €198 million of our revenue.

We enter into agreements with independent garages, pursuant to which they become AD-branded garages
and receive enhanced service and support from us in exchange for a membership fee and our wholly-owned and
affiliated independent distributors are designated as their preferred distributors of spare parts. Our branded
garages in our light vehicle activities are not owned by us. Joining the AD brand allows garages to remain
independent while gaining the benefit of accessing our services and the commercial terms that we have
negotiated with suppliers.

132


-----

We also benefit from our network of branded garages, which made us the largest and the fastest growing
light vehicle garage network in France in 2017, as shown in the graphic below.

Our total network included approximately 4,000 branded and affiliated garages in 2017, of which 3,246
were in France and the remainder were in Benelux and Italy. Additionally, our network of branded garages
provides us with a reliable source of orders since branded garages agree to purchase a minimum amount
(generally 70%) of their products from us per year and also pay fees to us in exchange for certain value-added
services.

We also distribute products to retail and other outlets such as Midas, Euromaster and Speedy and to certain
“key accounts” that have a national presence (such as Feu Vert, Norauto and Auto 5). Our key accounts represent
an increasing share of our revenue. In 2014, sales to key accounts represented €44 million of our revenue and in
2017 they represented €57 million of our revenue. We also distribute our products to web dealers (such as Mister
Auto). Our sales to web dealers account for an increasing share of our revenue. In 2014, sales to web dealers
represented €64 million of our revenue and in 2017 they represented €101 million of our revenue. In our Trucks
segment, we also distribute products to integrated workshops.

We offer a one-stop-shop scheme designed to match our customers’ needs, which vary according to
customer type. For example, our garage customers, focused on maintenance and body parts, rely on distributors
because they need to be able to provide services quickly to their customers, which requires them to offer a large
and diversified product portfolio that can be supplied quickly, while holding little to no inventory. Providing the
right part at the right place and right time is therefore critical to meeting our garage customers’ needs and we
offer a distribution model based on proximity. Garages also need technical support with diagnostics,
identification of parts and repair methods and the ordering of tools, and often require frequent training, as spare
parts become more complex. We provide these services, replicating the types of programs that OEMs provide to
their own networks, but expanding these services across the full range of light vehicles. Our online customers and
key accounts have similar needs to garages: supplying their customers quickly with a large product assortment
while having little to no capacity for inventory and storage. We meet these needs by offering up to two deliveries
a day, with some deliveries undertaken within two hours of the order placement, through two dedicated logistics
platforms, ACR and Doyen Auto.

Customers generally select spare parts suppliers and distributors based on a number of factors, including
product range and availability, service offering, price and services. Our distribution model, combined with the
services we offer, is designed to match customers’ needs, leading to customer loyalty.

Our services include:

   - _Best-in-class delivery times: Through our automated warehouses, we make deliveries to our customers_
up to six times per day and delivery times for some products can be as short as two to four hours from
the time of order, with many other products being delivered within one day.

   - _Commercial support: Our locally-based sales teams offer sales advisory and team training services and_
employed approximately 500 full-time employees in 2017. We strengthened this service with our
partnership with the IDRAC business school, which helps select and integrate new sales teams, notably

133


-----

via apprenticeships. We created a tablet-based “e-book” that customers can use to view product details
and instructional and support videos. We also provide customer service through our “Assistance Diag”
call centers, which handled approximately 21,000 calls per day in 2017, with an average wait time of
17 seconds for our 1,500 key users. Assistance Diag addresses 95% of the products we distribute and
450,000 technical issues, with seven hotlines that are specialized by carmakers.

   - _Training and technical support: We offer a range of technical support services to our customers,_
including, for example, a multi-brand diagnostic tool, Diag’issimo, which helps customers identify the
source of product and systems breakdowns. We also offer comprehensive training opportunities. For
example, our customers can benefit from dedicated training modules through “AD Academy.” In 2017,
we acquired Grup Eina, a company based in Spain with call centers and staff dedicated of the French
market, in order to enhance our digital support and training offering, with practical trainings that
address the increasing complexity of car maintenance, including simulations of data systems
breakdowns.

   - _Strong commercial concept and integrated branding: Another key differentiating feature is our strong_
commercial concept and integrated branding. Our brands benefit from strong brand awareness among
drivers. For example, according to an independent third- party survey conducted in France in 2017, the
“Autodistribution” brand enjoys the highest brand awareness among our peers, with 92% brand
awareness (of which, unprompted awareness of 74% and prompted awareness of 18%). The second
ranking player in France had only 37% brand awareness.

   - _Business leads to key third-party providers: We partner with certain third-party providers, such as_
major insurers (such as Allianz, MAAF, Macif and AXA) and car fleets (such as AVIS, Europcar and
Eiffage), which helps drive B2C (DIY) sales within our repairer customers’ networks. We manage
these partnerships with four dedicated teams, employing 40 people, and, in 2017, handled
approximately 500,000 requests, leading to approximately 40,000 services. We estimate that such
partnerships drove approximately €230 million in business to our AD-branded garages and Mondial
Pare-Brise customers in 2017.

   - _Online tools: We have developed online tools to support our customers with online ordering as well as_
other IT functions. For example, our proprietary online portal, Autossimo, which made 2.1 million
spare parts across 517 product families available to more than 10,000 subscribers and processed more
than 5,000 product orders per day in 2017. Autossimo improves customers’ experiences by offering a
user-friendly portal for garages to search through a large selection of spare parts, directly order parts
online and obtain technical information about those parts. Autossimo features approximately
2.3 million parts in our catalogue, supplied by 316 OEMs/OESs. In 2017, one-third of French garages
were Autossimo customers and 20% of our orders were placed online (as compared with 12% in 2014).

We also created ID Garages, which allows drivers to get a quote and schedule a service appointment online,
driving business to our branded garages. We believe ID Garages are a “win-win” solution for us, allowing us to
retain a percentage of the fee quote, and our suppliers and garages to collect fees from business gained through
the portal. In 2017, ID Garages served more than 2,000 subscribers and 3.2 million unique web visitors, with an
average of 3,000 bookings made per month via this portal in the fourth quarter of 2017. We estimate that ID
Garages generated approximately €700,000 in subscriptions and fees and drove approximately €4.2 million worth
of business to our garage customers for the year ended December 31, 2017.

**Our operational segments**

**_Light Vehicle France_**

The light vehicle France segment is our historical core activity, generating revenues of €855.1 million in the
year ended December 31, 2017, and distributing light vehicle spare parts and products to garages, body shops,
fast-fitters, online operators and integrated workshops. We have grown our light vehicle France segment
organically and with strategic acquisitions such as the acquisitions of Gobillot Rhône (2012), Rougon Queyrel
and FPLS (2013), ACR (2014) and Mondial Pare-Brise and Oocar (2017).

In 2017, we had approximately 335,000 square meters of light vehicle spare parts storage capacity in
France, which stocked approximately 147,000 SKUs representing approximately 1,400 brands. Our light vehicle
France network included 87 distributors and 3,127 branded garages. Under IFRS 15, for the year ended
December 31, 2017, sales to light vehicle France Affiliated Distributors constituted 9%, of the total light vehicle
France sales. Furthermore, in 2017, branded garages represented more than 30% of the sales made by light

vehicle France, followed by retail (approximately 10%), web dealers (approximately 10%) and key accounts
(approximately 5%). Our light vehicle France distribution network in Benelux makes up to six deliveries per day,
with delivery times as low as two hours.

Our light vehicle France segment is supported by three logistics platforms: Logisteo, ACR and Cora.

Logisteo is our automated warehouse. It is a central platform that enables stock deliveries to French
distributors once per day. Logisteo is located in Réau, France and represented a total cost of €30 million as of
December 31, 2017. As of 2017, it was the largest independent logistics platform for light vehicle parts for
maintenance and repair in France. It has over 30,000 square meters of storage space and stores approximately
120,000 SKUs (as compared with storage of approximately 55,000 SKUs before the implementation of
Logisteo). Logisteo prepares approximately 63,000 lines per day (as compared with approximately 30,000 lines
per day before the implementation of Logisteo) and completes approximately 3,000 orders per hour, serving
approximately 500 local distributors. We estimate that Logisteo has driven a 30% improvement in productivity
and that Logisteo supplies virtually all of our French light vehicle distribution locations and employs
approximately 200 full-time employees (as of December 31, 2017, a reduction of approximately 100 full-time
employees since the inception of Logisteo). Deliveries of regular orders are made before 8:00 a.m. arrive the next
business day. Logisteo has also enabled us to consolidate our supply flows to a single delivery point, which
permits us to offer a wide-range of constantly available products while capturing logistics fees from our suppliers
that generally exceed our logistics costs, generating higher margins.

ACR is a specialized, automated platform that services our key accounts and online customers in France,
with stock deliveries of light vehicle spare parts made two times per day and emergency deliveries made to
wholesalers as needed. Deliveries of regular orders are made within four hours. ACR was established in 2010 and
was acquired by us in 2014. It has approximately 22,000 square meters of storage space at eight regional
locations across France and a central platform in Gennevilliers, France and stocked approximately 75,000 SKUs
in total.

Cora is our specialized, partially automated platform for light vehicle body parts for collision repair in
France. Cora was established in 1967 and was acquired by us in 2005. Cora operates from our hub in Chaponnay,
France. It has approximately 35,000 square meters of storage space and stores approximately 70,000 SKUs.
Deliveries of regular orders are made within one business day.

**_Light Vehicle International_**

Our Light Vehicle International segment generated revenues of €242.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017, and is supported by two partially automated logistics platforms: Doyen Auto and OVAM/
Ricauto. Collectively, they have approximately 86,000 square meters of storage space and stock approximately
100,000 SKUs.

_Benelux_

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 60,000 square meters of storage capacity in Benelux that
stocked approximately 86,000 SKUs representing more than 110 brands. Our network in Benelux included 161
distributors, including 60 Doyen Auto franchisees, and more than 300 “1, 2, 3 Auto Service” garages and more
than 160 Requal garages in 2017. Our distribution network in Benelux makes up to two deliveries per day, with
delivery times under three hours. In the 2011 to 2017 period, the Doyen Auto Group’s revenue in Benelux grew
organically at a CAGR of 8%. Revenue organic growth in the Netherlands is currently 10% per annum.

In 2016, we acquired the Doyen Auto Group, giving us access to the Belgian and Dutch markets through
Doyen Auto’s network of affiliated distributors (API) and two networks of branded garages (1,2,3 AutoService
and Requal). The acquisition of the Doyen Auto Group also gave us exposure to the web dealer channel in
Benelux and strengthened our position with web dealers in France and also expanded our market share in France
through Doyen Auto Group’s light vehicle spare parts distribution operations in France. Doyen Auto’s activities
are managed on an international level from Belgium. Since the acquisition of Doyen Auto, we have exported the
Autodistribution concept, network and platforms to these new markets, while developing a complementary offer
that targets differentiated customers (such as smaller distributors).

In 2018, we acquired Geevers, an independent retailer of light vehicle spare parts in Benelux, which stocks
over 100,000 spare body parts and offers approximately four million products, and Verviers Freins, a Belgian
multi-brand distributor of mechanical parts, bodywork, paint, tools and garage equipment in the Liège region.

The map below shows our network in Benelux as of September 30, 2018.

Our customers in Benelux are API distributors (wholesalers with an API distribution contract), web players,
repairer groups (such as Auto 5, First Stop and Midas) and wholesalers (independent auto parts distributors).

_Italy_

Since the acquisition of G-Group in June 2018, we have approximately 36,000 square meters of storage
capacity in Italy that stocks approximately 200,000 SKUs representing more than 150 brands. Our network in
Italy includes 2,500 distributors.

In 2017, we acquired three Italian players, OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car, making us the number two player
in Italy. OVAM operates in five distribution locations (operating in the Padua and Treviso area under the “Sarco”
brand and in the Florence area under the “Sarpi” brand) which serve a network of 900 installers/repairers and
offers approximately 100,000 SKUs. Ricauto and Top Car operate in two distribution locations (mainly in the
Padua area) and offer approximately 65,000 SKUs. In March 2018, we expanded further into Italy with the
acquisitions of Sarco and FGL. In 2017, Sarco and FGL operated one distribution site each, stocking 40,000
SKUs and 35,000 SKUs, respectively. In June 2018, we acquired G-Group which operates in southern Italy and
serves a network of 1,000 installers or repairers with approximately 140,000 active SKUs.

The map below shows our presence in Italy following the acquisition of OVAM, Ricauto, Top Car and
G-Group, as of September 30, 2018.

We are working on capturing synergies in Italy through a local CPU which is modeled on our CPU in
France, and by replicating our negotiating strategy with suppliers in France.

**_Trucks_**

Our Trucks segment addresses two market levels: distribution and repair and maintenance. At the
distribution level, we distribute products to garages and integrated workshops and we are able to make deliveries
in under four hours around France. At the repair and maintenance level, we offer our services through a whollyowned network of garages. In 2017, our Trucks segment generated revenue, including all network sales, of
€220 million.

136


-----

We benefit from a scale effect, holding 18% market share in the truck IAM in France and managing a large
network of approximately 200 locations (of which approximately 130 are service and distribution locations and
approximately 70 are AD Poids Lourds-branded garages).

The map below shows our truck spare parts distribution and repair network in France as of September 30,
2018.

In recent years, our Trucks segment has experienced challenges due to difficult market conditions as well as
a lack of truck spare parts specialization embedded in the light vehicle business, a lack of central focus and
performance monitoring and underperforming locations.

Over the 2015 to 2017 period, our Trucks segment revenue decreased by 1.5%, from €160.0 million to
€157.6 million. Our Trucks segment’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to
€2.8 million and 1.8%, respectively, in 2015, was €0.0 in 2016 and increased to €1.6 million and 1.0%,
respectively, in 2017.

Our value-added services approach for our Trucks segment is based on and adapted from the same approach
we use in our light vehicle segments and includes:

   - _Best-in-class delivery times: We have approximately 10,000 square meters of dedicated logistics_
platform space for our Trucks segment and stores approximately 25,000 SKUs.

   - _Commercial support: We employ locally-based sales teams, comprising 370 professionals in 2017, of_
which 20 were managers, 200 were salespersons and 150 were on-field salespersons. The success of
these efforts is evidenced in the fact that AD Poids Lourds earned the highest net promoter score
among independent players in France in 2017, with 75% of positive answers.

   - _Training and technical support: We run a training center, “Institut AD” and a technical support_
platform dedicated to our Trucks segment through a partnership with IMA Technologies.

   - _Strong commercial concept and integrated branding: As in our light vehicle segments, we employ an_
integrated, single brand approach in our Trucks segment, leading to strong lock-up of affiliates (both
distributors and garages). AD Poids Lourds is a unique brand with the highest brand recognition (47%
unprompted awareness) among independent players in France in 2017, with 2.5 times higher awareness
than the number two player. Demonstrating the power of this brand awareness, we are a partner of
choice for truck fleet operators and garages and there are early signs of success as measured by
improved monthly revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2017.

   - _Business focus on key accounts: In 2017, 20% of our revenue in our Trucks segment was generated_
from national key accounts (such as Veolia and Geodis), with 60% of revenue in our Trucks segment
generated from national and regional key accounts collectively.

137


-----

   - _Online tools: We offer a dedicated online portal, Truckissimo, for our Trucks segment, which includes_
continuously updated technical databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use tool outlining
repair methods and connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price comparison
tools by brand and inventory access. We also offer our customers digital support through AD Connect.

We also seek to capture upside from our partnership with Alltrucks, a joint venture created by OESs to
create a network of affiliated workshops. Founded in 2013 and present in ten countries as of 2018, Alltrucks
offers our affiliated workshops exclusive multi-brand diagnostics and trainings, technical assistance and access to
a pan-European workshop network. We benefit from our membership in Alltrucks, and our Level 2 accreditation
with three OESs grants us an improved access to parts and gaining access to foreign truck operations that are
active in France.

Our Trucks segment is supported by one specialized, partially automated logistics platform, Bremstar.
Bremstar was established in 1995 and was acquired by us in 2008. Bremstar operates from our hub in SaintFargeau-Ponthierry, France. It has approximately 10,000 square meters of storage space and stores approximately
25,000 SKUs. Deliveries of regular orders are made within one business day.

**Sales and marketing**

Our success is largely attributable to the loyalty of our customers and we commit substantial time and
resources to understanding, communicating and meeting the needs of our customers.

Our sales department is responsible for managing relationships with existing customers and establishing
relationships with new customers, setting sales targets and implementing sales policies, which includes customer
payment terms in cooperation with the finance and control department and managing payment collection in
cooperation with the administration department.

Our marketing department is located at our headquarters in Arcueil, France, and is focused on improving
awareness and perception of our brands. We market our distribution services to both affiliated independent
distributors and garages, and engages in joint marketing campaigns with our suppliers that target customers. This
integrated branding approach increases our visibility and helps us recruit new branded garages.

We continuously invest in our marketing efforts in order to sustain sales and upgrade our existing offerings.
Our websites are one of our main marketing tools. Our websites received an average of 200,000 individual
visitors per month in 2017. We also regularly organize promotional campaigns for certain of the spare parts that
we distribute.

**Customer service**

We provide support to our customers through call centers, mobile technology, training programs and
customer outreach. We have structured our customer service around the principle of bringing business to our
customers, leveraging the various value-added services it offers customers to help them grow their own sales and
services offerings.

We monitor the performance of our commercial support initiatives. Our sales persons had an average
portfolio of €1.8 million in 2017 (as compared with €1.4 million in 2014) and met 63 clients per month on
average in 2017, which represents 7.1 daily client visits, as compared with 6.2 in 2014. In the year ended
December 31, 2017, we recorded lower average return rates (approximately 8-10%) for our products as compared
with industry averages.

**Information technology**

Our business depends on having advanced, secure information systems and capacity to store, retrieve,
process and manage large quantities of information. Our IT teams play an important role in our distribution
process and operations by providing support for sales, inventory and supply chain logistics, accounting and
internal controls.

Our IT strategy is currently structured around local IT teams that are adapted to our business needs in
specific locations, while taking a unified approach for our financial reporting systems. This has enabled us to
leverage our acquisition target’s IT systems that are in place at the time of an acquisition. In addition and
following our recent international expansion, we plan to implement a transformation of our global IT strategy,
which is focused on leveraging best practices and coherence and consistency among our IT systems.

138


-----

Our IT systems are supervised by our information officer and are managed in-house by teams of IT
professionals who are supported by third parties. In addition, our online activities are overseen by managers with
e-commerce experience.

Two fully redundant data centers support the continuity and connectivity of our IT systems and our data is
backed up daily. Various business continuity plans have been created to respond to possible future incidents.
These plans are regularly reviewed, tested and updated.

Our IT systems provide a full range of business process support and information to our management,
logistics platforms and customers. We utilize a combination of customized and industry standard software
systems to provide various functions related to:

   - inventory management;

   - e-commerce fulfillment;

   - quality control;

   - front office and back office applications; and

   - contact with our suppliers.

Our IT teams, in coordination with the sales department, have developed software, including customized
licensed software, to integrate our logistics platforms with an electronic interface that allows customers to place
orders online and obtain information regarding product availability, sales terms, conditions and shipping times,
including Autossimo and Truckissimo. In 2012, our IT teams also developed a tablet-based “e-book” program
that allows our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and make suggestions for purchases based
on customer profile.

Our IT teams collaborate with the logistics department, primarily to update the software and algorithms used
to determine adequate inventory levels at our warehouses, product flows and optimal shelf positioning for
products. We have recently upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT management system of our
light vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage inventory more efficiently. Our IT system also
enables it to determine product availability in real time and update the inventories in our warehouses accordingly.

**_Intellectual property_**

Our intellectual property comprises a combination of complementary rights, including the following:

   - _Copyrights. We maintain a policy of filing preliminary copyright applications (enveloppes Soleau) with_
the French Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle for our product designs. We submit our
drawings and designs to a bailiff (huissier), which identifies us as the inventor and is intended to
prevent competitors from copying our designs.

   - _Trademarks. We own the right to the “Autodis Group” and “Autodistribution” names, our most_
important trademarks, which we have registered with the European Community Trademark and
International Trademark Registration. Autodistribution also owns the right to certain other names that
we use in ordinary course of business, including Garage Expert AD, Auto Primo, Autossimo, AD PL,
the “AD” logo and ISOTECH, which we have registered with the European Community Trademark
and International Trademark Registration.

   - _Database rights. We own certain rights with respect to our customer database, in compliance with_
European and French regulations, in particular with the regulations promulgated by the French
National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des
_libertes) relating to notification of use of “cookies.”_

   - _Domain names. We own a portfolio of domain names and has registered them with the relevant_
authorities.

Some of our products integrate third-party technologies. In order to obtain the rights to use these third-party
technologies, we have entered into license agreements in connection with certain software that it uses for our
back-office, finance, human resources and store management systems.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2017, we employed 5,974 people. The following table sets forth the number of
employees as of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

**Year ended December 31,**

In the last three years, we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as a result of strikes,
work stoppages or other labor disputes that were specific to us. We believe that our relations with our employees
are good.

We attach great importance to providing high-quality and expert service to our customers. Maintaining and
repairing complex light vehicles and trucks requires well-trained and skillful employees. Selling light vehicle and
truck spare parts and equipment and tools also requires expertise regarding the products and their use. We
therefore provide our employees with a broad range of training.

To ensure the continued professional development of our employees, we organize our human resources
strategy around seven pillars:

   - _Recruiting: in 2017, we received more than 1,700 job applications and featured 270 job opportunities_
on our website. We have also partnered with the IDRAC business school to hire future salespersons.

   - _Development: in 2017, we directed 2.4% (amounting to approximately €3 million) of total wages to_
training and development programs and approximately 2,500 full-time employees received training.
We have also partnered with EM Lyon to train local mangers.

   - _Compensation: we engage in payroll monitoring and employs standardized compensation policies,_
including a profit sharing mechanism.

   - _People and talent review: we had staff turnover of 13% in 2017 and pursues a strategy of active career_
management for our employees. We have created career committees at the local level, with an
appraisal process that is managed by the executive committee. We also has a talent management
program that identifies the top 200 to 300 employees.

   - _Consistency: we are in the process of implementing a single social protection framework to address_
retirement and health insurance plans to replace the 135 frameworks that were in place when the
process began.

   - _Work environment: we invest in our workspaces and employs mechanization where possible to reduce_
strain on the part of workers, particularly in warehouses.

   - _Social climate: we have not experienced a strike in the last five years._

**Property, plant and equipment**

The majority of our sites are leased. As of December 31, 2017, we leased and owned the following property,
plant and equipment:

   - One office that serves as our headquarters in France, located at 22, avenue Aristide Briand, 94110
Arcueil, France.

   - One office that serves as our headquarters in Belgium, located at W.A. Mozartlaan 8, 1620, Drogenbos,
Belgium.

   - One office that serves as our headquarters in the Netherlands, located at Bruistensingel 680, 5232 AJ,
s’Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands.

   - One office that serves as our headquarters in Italy, located at 12 via Isaac Newton, Pero, Milano, Italy.

   - Five warehousing and logistics sites in France, substantially all of which we lease.

   - Approximately 330 owned distribution locations.

140


-----

   - A network of affiliated independent garages which includes 1,331 AD Garage and AD Expert garages,
676 AD Carrosserie garages, 1,021 Auto Primo garages and 99 Staff Auto garages in France, which are
dedicated to our light vehicle operations and 70 additional garages that are dedicated to our Trucks
segment’s operations.

   - One warehousing logistics center near Seneffe, Belgium.

   - Two warehousing and logistics centers in Zwolle and Waalwijk in the Netherlands.

   - Nine logistics sites in Italy, in and around Ancona, Brescia, Florence, Milan, Padua, Reggio Emilia and
Torino.

**Environment and sustainable development**

**_Environmental regulations_**

In connection with our operations, we are generally subject to environmental laws and regulations in each of
the countries where it operates and distributes our products. Although we do not manufacture the products we
distribute, the storage of spare parts subjects our facilities and operations to environmental and occupational
health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. These laws govern, among
other things, discharges of pollutants, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and the
clean-up of contaminated properties.

Environmental authorizations or permits required for some of our operations may be reviewed, modified or
revoked by the issuing authorities. We believe that we are in material compliance with the environmental laws
applicable to our business. Our environmental and occupational health and safety costs have not significantly
affected our results of operations or financial position during the previous twelve months.

**_Environmental and sustainable development policy_**

We pay close attention to the environmental impact of our business in the management of our sites and we
are committed to corporate social and environmental responsibility.

For example, we carried out an audit of the energy performance of each of our subsidiaries in 2016. In
addition, as part of our acquisition process, we carry out systematic environmental due diligence for all
acquisition targets. If phase I of the environmental due diligence reveals environmental matters needing
resolution, a phase II audit is carried out and we do not enter into any transaction before the resolution of the
matters that were identified in phase I of the due diligence. Regarding pollution risks, our insurance broker
carries out preventative site inspections and, when pollution cases are reported to us, a remediation plan is
deployed.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary operation of our business, including
property and casualty insurance policies that are typical for the industry in which we operate, at levels that we
believe are appropriate when taking into account our size and the risks incurred.

Our global insurance programs are negotiated and coordinated by our headquarters, which is responsible for
identifying our insurable risks, quantifying their potential consequences for us, and designing or structuring
adequate insurance programs with the support of leading insurance brokers with international networks. We aim
to ensure that it maintains sufficient coverage for all our activities and locations worldwide. We have established
internal claims procedures for each of our insurance policies in the event we experience a loss. We also
periodically review our insurance coverage in light of innovative and new risk transfer solutions offered by the
insurance markets in order to ensure that the terms and conditions of our coverage are adequate, to verify that our
deductibles and premiums are at reasonable levels and to reflect changes in our risk profile that arise as a result
of events such as mergers and acquisitions, new fields of activity and the development of new technologies.

Our global insurance programs generally take the form of master policies, which apply to our operations
worldwide. We enter into local insurance policies generated from these master programs to comply with local
insurance-related regulatory obligations, as applicable in certain countries. We do not operate, rent or own any
captive insurance vehicles.

Our main insurance policies, entered into with reputable insurance companies, cover lines of exposures
including the following:

   - general liability insurance, which covers general corporate liability;

141


-----

   - IT insurance, which covers technology based services;

   - workers’ compensation insurance;

   - property damage and business interruption insurance;

   - environmental liability insurance;

   - transit freight insurance;

   - director and officer liability insurance; and

   - fleet insurance.

Our insurance policies contain exclusions, caps and deductibles that could expose us to unfavorable
consequences in the event of a significant event or legal action against it. Moreover, we may be required to
indemnify third parties for certain damages that are not covered by our insurance policies or to incur significant
expenses that may not be covered, or may be insufficiently covered, under our insurance policies.

**Legal proceedings**

We become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our
business, such as employee claims, disputes with our suppliers, disputes with our lessors at the renewal of our
commercial leases and intellectual property disputes. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings
which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be difficult to
predict and we offer no assurance in this regard.

142

**REGULATION**

_We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. Some of the most pertinent to the business sector_
_in which we operate are laws and regulations that pertain to the light vehicle and truck wholesale sector and_
_light vehicle inspections. The paragraphs below briefly describe some of that laws and regulations (focusing on_
_French and EU laws and regulations). This section does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the_
_laws and regulations to which we are subject and that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Senior_
_Secured Notes._

**European Union**

The sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts’ wholesale and repair and maintenance services are
currently regulated in the European Union by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”), which replaced
Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) in 2010. Unlike BER 2002, the New BER does not apply to
the purchase, sale or resale of new motor vehicles, which are covered by Regulation 330/2010/EC. Accordingly,
the material scope of the New BER is now limited to the distribution of spare parts and the provision of repair
and maintenance services for motor vehicles.

The New BER also applies to (i) the general EU competition law and (ii) the General Vertical Block
Exemption Regulation (Commission Regulation (EU) n°330/2010 of April 20, 2010 on the Application of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices
(the “General BER”)) and the corresponding EU Guidelines on Vertical Restraints.

These provisions aim to ensure fair competition in these markets in order to safeguard that original and
equivalent spare parts competing with those branded by the light vehicle (referred to as “passenger cars” under
the New BER) and trucks (referred to as “commercial vehicles” under the New BER) manufacturers have full
access to the market.

Pursuant to these rules, agreements relating to the sale or distribution of light vehicle and truck spare parts
and repair and maintenance services are exempted from the application of Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”), which prohibits anticompetitive agreements and concerted
practices, if they comply with the provisions of both:

   - the General BER, which only applies if:

– both parties have less than 30% of the market share in their respective markets; and

– the agreement does not contain any of the hardcore restrictions provided in the General BER; and

   - the New BER, which implies that:

– no restriction may be imposed on the business of independent garages by way of a selective
distribution system under which a member of the network is prohibited from selling goods or
services to independent garages;

– no limitations may be imposed on any supplier of spare parts, repair tools, diagnostic or other
equipment to freely sell such goods to independent or authorized distributors, garages or
end-users; and

– no restrictions may be imposed on suppliers of components for the initial assembly of motor
vehicles limiting their ability to place their own trademark or logo effectively and easily on the
components supplied or on spare parts.

Furthermore, the European Commission may declare that both the General BER and the New BER are not
applicable where parallel networks with similar competition restraints cover more than 50% of a relevant market.

The agreements relating to the sale and distribution of spare parts that do not fulfill the conditions of the
General BER and/or of the New BER (which, according to the European Commission, is likely to be the case for
most agreements) may nonetheless benefit from an individual exemption if they fulfill the conditions provided in
Article 101(3) of the TFEU.

In this regard, however, notice no. 2010/C 138/05 (European Commission’s Supplementary Guidelines on
Vertical Restraints in Agreements for the Sale and Repair of Vehicles and for the Distribution of Replacement
Parts for Vehicles) (“notice 2010/C 138/05”), which provides some guidelines on the application and
interpretation of the New BER, further specifies that it is very doubtful that selective distribution agreements that

143


-----

would contain any of the two following restrictions could benefit from an exemption under Article 101(3) of the
TFEU:

   - failure for the motor vehicle manufacturer to provide independent operators (including independent
repairers, spare parts manufacturers and distributors, manufacturers of repair equipment or tools,
publishers of technical information, automobile clubs, roadside assistance operators, operators offering
inspection and testing services, and operators offering training for repairers) with appropriate access to
the brand-specific technical information required to perform repair and maintenance work on branded
motor vehicles in fair competition with authorized garages and distributors; and

   - explicit or implicit reservation of repair services by the supplier to the members of its authorized
network only. As Recital 69 of notice no. 2010/C 138/05 clarifies, the legal or extended warranty may
not, for example, be conditioned either (i) on the obligation for the end-user to have the repair and
maintenance services not covered by the warranty exclusively performed by a member of the network
or (ii) on the obligation for the end- user to use spare parts branded by the manufacturer in respect of
replacements not covered by the warranty.

The foregoing provisions aim essentially to foster access to the repair and maintenance services marketed by
independent garages and facilitate the identification of compatible spare parts of alternative suppliers, thereby
fostering competition between such articles (known as “equivalent” parts) and those bearing the manufacturer’s
trademark.

As further specified by the European Commission in notice no. 2010/C 138/05, the New BER also aims to
protect access by spare parts suppliers to the motor vehicle aftermarkets, thereby ensuring that competing brands
of spare parts continue to be available to both independent and authorized repairers, as well as to parts
wholesalers. The European Commission emphasizes that the availability of such spare parts entails significant
advantages for consumers especially since there are often large differences in price between parts sold by the
manufacturer and alternative parts. In particular, the following may be employed as substitutes for spare parts
bearing the manufacturer’s trademark: (i) original parts manufactured and distributed by original equipment
suppliers; and (ii) replacement parts of “equivalent quality” to the original components. In the same notice, the
European Commission specifies that in order to be considered to be of “equivalent quality,” spare parts must be
“of a sufficiently high quality that their use does not endanger the reputation of the authorized network” that
employs them. The European Commission places the burden of proving that a part does not satisfy the
requirements for being considered of “equivalent quality” on the vehicle manufacturer.

In France, the New BER, as well as the General BER, are binding and directly applicable. Accordingly, the
French courts and the French Competition Authority assess vertical agreements entered into in the sectors of light
vehicle and truck spare parts wholesale and repair and maintenance services in light of these regulations and of
the corresponding guidelines.

**Inspection**

European light vehicle inspections are currently regulated by the Directive of the European Parliament and
the Council of Europe dated as of April 3, 2014 (“Directive 2014/45/EU”), as amended, providing for periodic
technical inspections of each vehicle matriculated in a Member State.

With regard to light vehicles with fewer than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat) and trucks permitted to
operate up to 3.5 tons, Directive 2014/45/EU requires inspections to be made (i) four years after the first
utilization and (ii) every two years thereafter. With regard to light vehicles with more than eight seats (excluding
the driver’s seat), trucks authorized to carry more than 3.5 tons, taxis and ambulances, such controls must be
performed within one year from the first utilization and every year thereafter.

In France, the requirements set forth in Directive 2014/45/EU have been provided for in the French
Highway Code since 2004. If vehicles are not inspected when due, pecuniary penalties can be imposed and may
be increased for repeated violation or for vehicles on the road that were suspended as a result of the inspection
and may also entail the impoundment of the vehicle or the confiscation of the vehicle registration certificate
(Articles R.323-1 et seq. of the French Highway Code).

**Protection of design and models for “visible” parts**

In the absence of EU harmonization, each Member State remains free to govern the legal protection of
designs and models for “visible” parts. In France, according to the French Intellectual Property Code, the
distribution of “visible” parts (such as wings, bumpers and windscreens) is protected by industrial design rights
(Articles L-511-1 and seq. of the French Intellectual Property Code). Consequently, only the manufacturer has
the right to distribute these parts to various repairers. However, it must be noted that the French Competition
Authority has recently recommended the gradual removal of the restriction on the distribution of “visible” spare
parts destined for repairs.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and structure_**

On November 12, 2015, LuxCo 5 and LuxCo 6 entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement among,
_inter alios, the Issuer (upon its accession on December 8, 2015), J.P. Morgan Limited, Credit Suisse International_
and BNP Paribas S.A. as Arrangers, the financial institutions named therein as original lenders, the institution
named therein as Agent and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as Security Agent (each as defined therein), which was
amended on October 3, 2016, October 26, 2016, and November 3, 2016 (the “Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement”). Borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility were increased from €50.0 million to an
aggregate principal amount of €80.0 million on a committed basis as of June 13, 2018, and further increased to
€90.0 million on a committed basis on July 13, 2018.

The committed facility made available under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Revolving
Credit Facility”) may be utilized by any current or future borrower (“Borrower”) under the Revolving Credit
Facility in euro, pounds sterling and U.S. dollars and any other currency approved by the lenders by the drawing
of cash advances, the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit and by way of ancillary facilities. Subject
to certain exceptions, amounts may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed at any time. Borrowings will be
available for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
(as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing,
for capital expenditure, acquisitions and investments not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

In addition, subject to certain conditions, the Total Commitments under and as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement may be increased at any time up to an amount which, together with any other credit
facilities or debt securities ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility in right of payment and right to
receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral, would not exceed the basket for such permitted credit
facilities or debt securities under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including by way of (i) an increase in the
Total Commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) the inclusion and making available of
commitments in respect of one or more additional facilities.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized
until the date falling one month prior to the Termination Date (as defined below) of the Revolving Credit
Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantor are each a Borrower and Guarantor under and as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Issuer and, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles (as defined therein), the Guarantors. A mechanism is included in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement to enable any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries in France, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and any other agreed jurisdiction to accede as an Additional Borrower under the Revolving Credit
Facility subject to certain conditions.

**_Maturity and repayment requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on December 8, 2020 (the “Termination Date”).

Each utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating
thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under
the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Credit
Facility.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility is the rate per annum equal to the
aggregate of the applicable margin and EURIBOR or LIBOR (as applicable, subject to a 0% floor). The margin
under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be 3.50% per annum for the first twelve months of its term. From the

151


-----

date falling twelve months from December 8, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), and subject to certain conditions, the
margin on utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to a ratchet as follows:


**Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage ratio:**


**Margin**
**(percent per annum)**


Greater than 3.50:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.50%
Equal to or less than 3.50:1 but greater than 3.00:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.25%
Equal to or less than 3.00:1 but greater than 2.50:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.00%
Equal to or less than 2.50:1 but greater than 2.00:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.75%
Equal to or less than 2.00:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.50%

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from (and including) the Closing Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for
the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the
availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in
full or on the date on which a lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agent”) and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and fronting fees to the issuing bank under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and letter of credit fees to the Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) in an amount equal to the then applicable margin of the Revolving Credit Facility (and (if
applicable) an additional facility loan) with respect to an issuance of letters of credit (subject to certain conditions
and exclusions).

**_Guarantees_**

Each Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement has provided a senior secured guarantee of
all amounts payable to the finance parties by each other obligor (including any additional borrowers that accede
to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests”)._

**_Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the Collateral. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may
from time to time benefit from certain guarantees and security, in addition to the Collateral, which do not
guarantee or secure the Senior Secured Notes.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of security in respect the
Collateral (whether or not shared with the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) will be required to be applied to
repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Representations and warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, subject
to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that will apply to the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and a financial covenant. Set
forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual
knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

152

**_Notes purchase condition_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides that the Issuer may prepay/redeem/repurchase/ defease/
otherwise retire for value any senior secured notes issued by the Issuer under the senior secured notes indenture
dated January 31, 2014, and Existing Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes prior to their scheduled maturity (a
“Note Purchase”) without any obligation to make any pro rata prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility
commitments where such redemption or repurchase is (a) made: (i) following a Change of Control (as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and as further described in “—Mandatory prepayment requirements
_upon a change of control or a sale” below), provided that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility_
Agreement in respect of a Change of Control are complied with; (ii) from the proceeds of any indebtedness that
refinances any senior secured notes issued by the Issuer under the senior secured notes indenture dated
January 31, 2014, or Existing Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes that complies with the terms of the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement; or (iii) from the proceeds of new equity subscriptions, debt subordinated to
the Revolving Credit Facility in right of payment, amounts available to be distributed to the Parent Guarantor in

secured notes issued by the Issuer under the senior secured notes indenture dated January 31, 2014; and the
aggregate face value of any Existing Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes; over the life of the Revolving Credit
Facility (excluding for these purposes (i) any fees, make-whole payments, call premiums and other amounts not

any senior secured notes issued by the Issuer under the senior secured notes indenture dated January 31, 2014, or

Where the Issuer makes Note Purchases in excess of the Note Purchase Basket and which are not otherwise
made in accordance with paragraph (a) above, the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments shall be
cancelled, and if applicable, prepaid in the same proportion until the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments
have been reduced to not more than €20,000,000.

Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a change of control or a sale_**

Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which includes the sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries and, subject to certain
conditions, an Adverse Corporate Decision (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)) the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility Lenders”) shall not be obligated
to fund utilizations (other than rollover utilizations), and if a Revolving Credit Facility Lender requests and gives
notice to the Revolving Credit Facility Agent, within 30 days of receiving notice of such Change of Control, that
its commitments shall be cancelled and that it requires payment of all of its share of the outstanding utilizations
and all other amounts owing to it, the Revolving Credit Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Issuer that such
Revolving Credit Facility Lender shall be required to be prepaid or replaced and its commitments cancelled in
full on the date falling 30 days after such Revolving Credit Facility Lender has given notice to the Revolving
Credit Facility Agent.

**_Financial covenant_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we are required to test the drawn super senior leverage
covenant, being the ratio of drawn super senior net debt under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA, of 0.7:1 (the “Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant”) if, on any Test Date
(commencing on the first Test Date to occur after two full Test Periods have elapsed after the Closing Date), the
Test Condition has been met. The financial covenant is calculated and tested quarterly, provided that exceeding
the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant on any Test Date should only result in a drawstop under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and shall not constitute or result in a default or an event of default and shall
not operate as a drawstop in respect of any rollover loans or other rollover utilizations.

To the extent that the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant has been exceeded on a Test Date, subject to
certain limitations as more fully detailed in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer may cure that
covenant (i) automatically where the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant is not exceeded on the following
Test Date or the Test Condition is not met on the following Test Date or (ii) through the receipt of new
shareholder injections and/or subordinated shareholders loans by the date falling no later than 20 business days
after the date that the quarterly financial statements for that relevant period were due to be delivered, in an
amount sufficient to, subject to certain limitations and at the election of the Issuer ensure such Drawn Super
Senior Leverage Covenant would have been met had the proceeds from such new shareholder injection or
subordinated shareholder loan been applied (A) towards consolidated pro forma EBITDA or (B) in reduction of
drawn super senior net debt immediately prior to the end of the relevant period.

“Relevant Period” means each period of twelve months ending on or about the last day of each Test Date.

“Test Condition” means, on any Test Date, the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans under the
Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility by way of letters of credit
(or bank guarantees) or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any OID) on the last day of the
Relevant Period exceeds 35% of the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments as of such date or if higher, the
total Revolving Credit Facility commitments as at the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

“Test Date” means each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31.

“Test Period” means the period commencing on the day immediately following a Test Date and ending on
the next occurring Test Date.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for the same events of default (with certain adjustments
as necessary) as will be provided for under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for customary events of default, all of which are subject
to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as
appropriate, including: (i) misrepresentation; (ii) unlawfulness and invalidity; (iii) breach of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (iv) the repudiation and rescission of finance documents.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection
with it are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law although the restrictive
covenants certain information undertakings and certain events of default, which are included in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, are interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by, and shall be governed by, English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The following description is a summary of certain key provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not
restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, set forth all relevant exceptions to the provisions below in the
Intercreditor Agreement or replicate the provisions below in exactly the way in which they appear in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Issuer, the direct shareholder of the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer
have entered into an Intercreditor Agreement dated January 31, 2014, to govern the relationships and relative
priorities among: (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility; (ii) any persons who accede to the

154


-----

Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging agreements (collectively, the “Hedging
Agreements”; the liabilities under such Hedging Agreements, the “Hedging Liabilities”; and any persons that
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to such Hedging Agreements being referred to in such
capacity as the “Hedge Counterparties”); (iii) the trustee under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, on
its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes (for the purpose of this
“Description of certain financing arrangements,” the “Existing Notes”) (the “Existing Noteholders”) (the
“Existing Notes Trustee”); (iv) certain intragroup creditors and debtors; (v) certain direct or indirect shareholders
of the Issuer in respect of certain structural debt that the Issuer or another member of the Group has incurred or
may incur in the future (including any subordinated shareholder loans); and (vi) other lenders and creditors.

   - In this description, “Group” refers to the Issuer and each of its subsidiaries.

   - Each member of the Group that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the Revolving
Credit Facility, in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or under any other Debt Document (as defined
in “—Further security and incremental borrowings”) is referred to as a “Debtor” and are collectively
referred to as the “Debtors.”

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth:

   - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

   - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

   - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

   - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

   - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

   - turnover provisions; and

   - when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to transaction
security (such assets, the “Collateral”; such security, the “Transaction Security”; and the documents
constituting such Transaction Security, the “Transaction Security Documents”).

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to indebtedness that may be incurred by the
members of the Group, which is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit Facility Documents (as defined
below), the Existing Notes Documents (as defined below), any Pari Passu Debt Document (as defined below) and
any Senior Unsecured Notes Document (as defined below) to rank pari passu in right of payment with the
liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the liabilities under the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (for the purposes of this section, the “Existing Notes Liabilities,” the liabilities under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture (for the purposes of this section, the “Notes Liabilities”) and any existing Pari Passu
Liabilities (as defined below), then existing and to be secured on the Collateral, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness (excluding, for the purposes of this section, any Existing Notes
Liabilities) being the “Pari Passu Debt”); the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Pari Passu
Creditors”; the liabilities of the Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Pari Passu Liabilities”; and
the documents creating or evidencing the Pari Passu Liabilities, the “Pari Passu Debt Documents”).

The Intercreditor Agreement also includes provisions relating to indebtedness in the form of senior
unsecured notes (such indebtedness being “Senior Unsecured Notes,” the liabilities of the Debtors in respect of
such indebtedness being “Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities” and documents creating or evidencing the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities, the “Senior Unsecured Notes Documents”) that may be incurred by a special
purpose entity which is wholly-owned directly or indirectly by LuxCo 5 (other than the Issuer) and is neither a
member of the Group nor a subsidiary of the Issuer (such entity, the “Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer”) and
provisions relating to the liabilities in respect of guarantees granted by each guarantor of the Senior Unsecured
Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities”), that is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit
Facility Documents, the Existing Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing
Senior Unsecured Note Document to rank equally with any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, subject
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Senior
Unsecured Notes Creditors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides for any credit facility constituting a “Credit Facility” under the
Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the Existing Notes

155


-----

Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Document to
receive priority in respect of the proceeds of the enforcement against the Collateral (each such facility being a
“Credit Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities” and each finance
document relating thereto (but excluding any Hedging Agreement), a “Credit Facility Document”). Each lender
under a Credit Facility is a “Credit Facility Lender” and excluding any Hedging Liabilities, the liabilities of the
Debtors to the Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the “Credit Facility Lender Liabilities.”

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the
terms of a Debt Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will
prevail.

By purchasing a Senior Secured Note, holders of the Senior Secured Notes shall be deemed to have agreed
to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Trustee to
accede into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not
restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety.

**_Ranking and priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted payments described
below, that (i) the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities; (ii) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Hedging
Agreements entered into in relation to interest rate hedging in respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Senior
Secured Notes or any Senior Unsecured Notes or (2) in respect of Pari Passu Debt (the “Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities” and, together with the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities and the Creditor Representative Liabilities
owed to the Credit Facility Agent, the “Super Senior Liabilities” and the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities,
the “Super Senior Creditors”); (iii) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Hedging Agreements entered into
in relation to foreign currency hedging in respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes or the
Senior Unsecured Notes or (2) in respect of Pari Passu Debt (the “Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities” and the
creditors of the Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the “Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties”); (iv) the
Notes Liabilities; (v) the Existing Notes Liabilities; (vi) the Pari Passu Liabilities (together with the Notes
Liabilities and the Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Liabilities,” and the creditors of
the Senior Secured Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditors”); (vii) the liabilities of the Issuer and the Debtors
in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities”) and (viii) certain other
unsecured liabilities, will rank in right and priority of payment in the following order:

   - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the liabilities of any Debtor to an arranger under the Revolving
Credit Facility (the “Arranger Liabilities”), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the liabilities owed to the
Security Agent will rank pari passu and without any preference between them; and

   - second, the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities will rank pari passu and without any
preference between them.

The intercompany obligations (the “Intra Group Liabilities” and the documents creating or evidencing such
Intra Group Liabilities being “Intra Group Debt Documents”) of any member of the Group that is party to the
Intercreditor Agreement in such capacity to any other member of the Group (each an “Intra Group Lender” and
collectively the “Intra Group Lenders”) which is party to the Intercreditor in such capacity are postponed and
subordinated to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors (as defined herein). The liabilities
owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Issuer (or any holding company or subsidiary of
the Issuer or any other subsidiary of any such holding company that is not a member of the Group) and any of
their respective transferees or successors (the “Shareholder Liabilities” and the documents creating or evidencing
such Shareholder Liabilities being “Shareholder Debt Documents”) are postponed and subordinated to the
Liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors.

In this section the Shareholder Liabilities and the Intra Group Liabilities are together referred to as the
“Subordinated Liabilities.”

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement have agreed or will agree, as applicable, in the Intercreditor
Agreement that the Transaction Security ranks and secures the following liabilities (but only to the extent that
such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

   - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Arranger Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities will rank
and secure such liabilities first, pari passu and without any preference between them; and

156


-----

   - second (to the extent only of any security granted in favor of the Security Agent over the shares, loans,
bonds or other equity or debt instruments issued by the Issuer to the Parent Guarantor or by any
holding company of the Parent Guarantor to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer (the “SUN Shared
Security”)), the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities.

The Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities and the Subordinated Liabilities will not be secured by any of the
Transaction Security unless permitted by the Credit Facility Documents, the Existing Notes Documents and any
Pari Passu Debt Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities shall be
secured by the SUN Shared Security, if any. The Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities are senior obligations of the
Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer. Until the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes
Creditors may not take any steps to appropriate the assets of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer in connection
with any enforcement action other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all Proceeds from Enforcement of the Collateral and certain other
recoveries will be applied as provided under “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction
_Security.”_

**_Further security and incremental borrowings_**

The creditors in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities (the Super Senior
Liabilities, the liabilities owed to Creditor Representatives (as defined herein, other than in paragraph (f) of that
definition), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Arranger Liabilities, together, the “Secured Liabilities,” and the
creditors thereof, the “Secured Parties” and the documents evidencing the Secured Liabilities, the “Secured Debt
Documents”) may take, accept or receive the benefit of additional security and additional guarantees, indemnities
or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Secured Liabilities, provided that,
if and to the extent legally possible, such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is also
granted to the Security Agent as agent and trustee of the other Secured Parties. Any such additional security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss will rank in the same order of priority as referred to above
and the proceeds of the enforcement of any such security will be applied as provided under “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security.”_

The Intercreditor Agreement contemplates the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring incremental borrowing
liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities under; or (ii) refinancing the borrowing liabilities incurred under the
documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or in respect of any Credit Facility, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt or the Subordinated
Liabilities (such documents or instruments together with Transaction Security Documents, the Shareholder Debt
Documents and the Intra Group Debt Documents being referred to collectively as the “Debt Documents”) and/or
incurring guarantee liabilities in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with any such refinancing
(such incremental borrowing liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being referred to as
“Additional Indebtedness”) which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with and/or share pari passu
in any Transaction Security with any existing liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing liabilities and/or to
share in the Transaction Security behind such existing liabilities. The Secured Parties and the creditors in respect
of the Subordinated Liabilities (the “Subordinated Creditors” and, collectively with the Secured Parties and the
Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors, the “Creditors” and each a “Creditor”) confirm in the Intercreditor Agreement
that, provided such financing or refinancing and such ranking and such security is permitted or not prohibited
under the terms of the Debt Documents, they will (at the Debtors’ cost) enter into such documentation as may be
necessary (including entering into a new intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement) to ensure that the Additional Indebtedness (and the liabilities and obligations of the
Debtors in respect of such Additional Indebtedness) will have the ranking permitted to be conferred upon it in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Documents, provided that such documentation does not in any significant
respect have a material adverse effect on the interests of any of the Secured Parties.

**_Security: Pari Passu Creditors and Notes Creditors_**

The Pari Passu Creditors and Notes Creditors may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

(a) security in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities and Existing Notes Liabilities in addition to the
Transaction Security if, at the same time, it is also granted either:

(i) to the Security Agent as trustee for the other Secured Parties in respect of their secured
obligations;

157


-----

(ii) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be granted in favor of the
Security Agent as trustee for the Secured Parties:

A. to the other Secured Parties in respect of their secured obligations; or

B. to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure for the benefit of the other Secured Parties; or

(iii) in the case of any security granted after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement, to some of the
Secured Parties provided that such security is incremental to the Transaction Security that has
already been granted in favor of all other Secured Parties and any proceeds derived from the
enforcement of such security will be shared with the Secured Parties in accordance with the
payment waterfalls set forth in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction
_Security.”_

and ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in “—Ranking and priority”; and

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities in
addition to those in:

(i) the original form of the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the documents or instruments creating or
evidencing the Existing Notes Liabilities (the “Existing Notes Documents”);

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given for the benefit of all the Secured
Parties in respect of their Secured Liabilities;

only if, in each case (1) the grant of such security or the giving of such guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss is permitted by the Credit Facility Documents and (2) at the same time, it is also granted to the Credit
Facility Lenders and granted to the other Secured Parties in respect of their respective Secured Liabilities and
ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in “—Ranking and priority.”

**_Permitted payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, prior to the occurrence of an acceleration event in respect of a Credit
Facility, the Pari Passu Liabilities and the Existing Notes Liabilities (a “Secured Debt Acceleration Event”),
payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes Documents and Pari
Passu Debt Documents, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Credit Facility Agreement, the
Existing Notes Documents and Pari Passu Debt Documents, but subject to, in the case of payments in respect of
the Pari Passu Liabilities and Notes Liabilities, any restrictions under the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes
Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents then outstanding. Following the occurrence of a Secured Debt
Acceleration Event, subject to certain exceptions, payments can only be made by the Debtors applying the
amounts received by the relevant Debtor under the process described under “—Application of proceeds from
_Enforcement of Transaction Security.” The restriction in the foregoing sentence shall not apply (i) where,_
provided that the Majority Super Senior Creditors constitute the Instructing Group in accordance with
“—Enforcement decision,” a payment block suspension notice has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent to
the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) to the extent that such
Secured Debt Acceleration Event has subsequently been cancelled and/or irrevocably revoked in writing by each
relevant Creditor Representative.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments in respect of Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee
Liabilities prior to the Secured Debt Discharge Date (as defined below) to be made by the Debtors under the
Senior Unsecured Notes Documents including if (a) (i) the payment is of any principal amount of the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer Liabilities which is either not prohibited from
being paid by the Credit Facility, the Existing Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Document or is paid on
or after the final maturity date of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is a
date not earlier than one year after the Termination Date at the time of issuance of such Senior Unsecured Notes)
or is a payment of any amount that is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest or a corresponding
amount under the relevant proceeds loan for the Senior Unsecured Notes (such amount including all scheduled
interest payments, including if applicable, special interest or liquidated damages) and default interest on the
Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Debt Document, additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in the relevant indenture for the

158


-----

Senior Unsecured Notes and/or applicable proceeds loan, (ii) no notice of a Secured Debt Event of Default (as
defined herein) has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) (as the case may be); and (iii) no payment default under any Credit Facility, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indenture (above an agreed threshold) and the Pari Passu Debt Documents (above an agreed
threshold) has occurred and is continuing; (b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined herein) and the
Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) give prior consent to that payment being made;
(c) the payment is of amounts owing to the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee (the “Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee Amounts”); (d) the payment is of administrative and maintenance costs, fees, expenses and taxes of the
Issuer (in acting as the issuer of the Senior Unsecured Notes) including any reporting or listing requirements, as
permitted under the terms of the Credit Facilities; or (e) the payment is of costs, commissions, taxes, premiums
and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Senior Unsecured
Notes Documents in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes
Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments to be made from time to time when due to lenders owed
any Intra Group Liabilities (“Intra Group Liabilities Payments”) if at the time of payment no Secured Debt
Acceleration Event or an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities has occurred and
is continuing (an “Acceleration Event”). The Intercreditor Agreement permits Intra Group Liabilities Payments if
(i) an Acceleration Event has occurred prior to the date on which the Super Senior Liabilities are discharged in
full (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Instructing Group (as defined, and further
described, in “—Enforcement decision”); (ii) an Acceleration Event has occurred after the Super Senior
Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Senior Secured Liabilities are discharged in full (the “Senior
Secured Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through their
Creditor Representatives); (iii) an Acceleration Event has occurred after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but
prior to the later of the date on which the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities are discharged (the “Senior
Unsecured Notes Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (as
defined herein) (acting through their Creditor Representatives); (iv) that payment is made to facilitate payment of
the Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Secured Liabilities; or (v) to the extent a Secured Debt Acceleration Event
has subsequently been cancelled and/or irrevocably revoked in writing by each relevant Creditor Representative,
the payment is made to facilitate payments of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities that are permitted to be paid
under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and, if such payment is made pursuant to Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantees, it would be permitted at such time. At any time prior to an Acceleration Event, each Debtor may
convert its Intra Group Liabilities into equity.

Payments may be made on Shareholder Liabilities from time to time when due if: (i) the payment is not
prohibited by a Credit Facility, the Existing Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the Senior
Unsecured Notes Documents; (ii) the payment is to be made to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer in respect of
any Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer Liabilities made in order to make a corresponding payment in Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities which is then due and payable by the Senior Unsecured Issuer pursuant to the Senior
Unsecured Notes Documents (or in the case of a payment in respect of scheduled interest, such payment will
become due and payable within three business days) to be made at the time such payment of Shareholder
Liabilities is made to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer; (iii) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group (as defined below) gives written consent to such payment being made; (iv) on or after the
Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give written consent to such payment
being made; or (v) after the Secured Debt Discharge Date but prior to Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, the
Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give
written consent to such payment being made. At any time prior to an Acceleration Event, Shareholder Liabilities
may be converted into equity.

**_Creditor Representative_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties will appoint various creditor representatives. “Creditor
Representative” means:

(a) in relation to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the facility agent under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement;

(b) in relation to the Credit Facility Lenders under any other Credit Facility, the facility agent in respect of
that credit facility (an “Additional Credit Facility Agent,” and, together with the facility agent under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, a “Credit Facility Agent”);

159


-----

(c) in relation to the Existing Noteholders, the Existing Notes Trustee;

(d) in relation to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders, the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(e) in relation to any Pari Passu Creditors, the creditor representative for that tranche of Pari Passu
Creditors (each a “Pari Passu Debt Representative”); and

(f) in relation to any Hedge Counterparty, such Hedge Counterparty (which shall be its own Creditor
Representative).

**_Issue of Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice_**

(a) Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date (the
“Secured Debt Discharge Date”), except with the prior consent of the Credit Facility Agent, the consent
of the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s), and subject to the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement which deal with the effects of an insolvency event, the Issuer shall
ensure that no member of the Group shall make, and no Senior Unsecured Noteholder may receive
from any member of the Group, any payment in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes which would
otherwise be permitted as referred to above (other than the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amount)
if:

(i) a payment default under the Secured Debt Documents (a “Secured Debt Payment Default”) has
occurred and is continuing; or

(ii) an event of default under a Credit Facility Document, the Existing Notes Documents or the Pari
Passu Debt Documents (other than a Secured Debt Payment Default) (a “Secured Debt Event of
Default”) has occurred and is continuing, from the date on which the Credit Facility Agent or the
Existing Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative (as the case may be) (the “Relevant
Representative”) delivers a notice (a “Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to that Secured Debt Event of Default to the Senior Unsecured
Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee, until the earliest of:

A. the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;

B. the date on which a Senior Unsecured Notes Default (as defined below) occurs for failure to
pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes;

C. in relation to payments of Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, if a Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of that Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Senior Unsecured Standstill Period
expires;

D. the date on which the relevant Secured Debt Event of Default is no longer continuing and, if
the relevant Secured Liabilities have been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded;

E. the date on which the Relevant Representative delivers a notice to the Senior Unsecured
Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee cancelling the
Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;

F. the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and

G. the date on which the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee takes any enforcement action that it is
permitted to take under the Intercreditor Agreement.

(b) Unless the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee waives this requirement:

(i) a new Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days
have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;
and

(ii) no Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Secured Debt Event
of Default more than 60 days after the date the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee or the Pari
Passu Debt Representative (as applicable) received notice of that Secured Debt Event of Default.

(c) The Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) may
serve only one Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of

160


-----

circumstances but this shall not, subject to paragraph (b) above, affect the right of the Credit Facility
Agent, the Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) to issue a Senior Unsecured Payment
Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

(d) The Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) may not serve a
Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to a Secured Debt Event of Default that had been
notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice was
issued.

**_Cure of payment stop: Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

If at any time following the issuance of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Secured Debt Payment Default:

(a) the Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or the Secured Debt Payment
Default ceases to be continuing, as the case may be; and

(b) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents and which would have
been permitted payments but for that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or Secured Debt Payment
Default, then any Event of Default that may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments
shall be waived and any Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice (as defined below) that may have been
issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being
required on the part of the Senior Unsecured Noteholders.

**_Restrictions on enforcement/certain challenges by Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

Until the Secured Debt Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by the Instructing
Group, no Senior Unsecured Noteholder shall take or require the taking of any enforcement action in relation to
the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities except as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (see
_“—Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement” below)._

**_Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement_**

(a) The above restrictions on enforcement will not apply if:

(i) an event of default (or event or circumstance which would, with the expiration of a grace period,
the giving of notice, the making of any determination provided for in the relevant definition of
“Event of Default” in the Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture or any combination of the foregoing,
be an event of default) under any Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture (a “Senior Unsecured Notes
Default”) (such default being a “Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default”) is continuing;

(ii) the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s)
have received a notice of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default from the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(iii) a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period.

(b) Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Unsecured Notes Default, the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee may, by notice (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Credit Facility
Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) of the existence of such
Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

**_Senior Unsecured Standstill Period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default, a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period shall mean
the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date”) the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee serves a Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice on the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee

161


-----

and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) in respect of such Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default and
ending on the earliest to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period”);

(b) the date the Secured Parties take any enforcement action (excluding any action taken to preserve or
perfect any Collateral as opposed to realizing it) in relation to a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor,
provided that the Senior Unsecured Noteholders may then only take the same enforcement action in
relation to the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor as the enforcement action taken by the Secured
Parties against such Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Group;

(c) the date of an insolvency event in relation to a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor against whom
enforcement action is to be taken;

(d) the date on which a Senior Unsecured Notes Default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original
scheduled maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes; and

(e) the expiration of any other Senior Unsecured Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiration occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy).

The Senior Unsecured Noteholders may take enforcement action as described above in relation to a
Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Unsecured Standstill Period
or at any later time, a further Senior Unsecured Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Relevant
Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee that it is enforcing Transaction
Security created over (directly or indirectly) shares of a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor, no Senior Unsecured
Noteholder may take any action referred to in “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement,”
against that Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor while the Security Agent is, in accordance with the instructions of
the Instructing Group, taking steps to enforce that Collateral where such action might be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Enforcement instructions_**

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or taking any other enforcement
action unless otherwise instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as further described in “—Enforcement
_decision” below)._

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms and subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent as to
the enforcement of the Transaction Security as they see fit provided that the instructions as to enforcement given
by the Instructing Group are consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (as defined herein).

**_Enforcement decision_**

If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through their
Creditor Representatives) (the “Instructing Group”) wish to instruct the Security Agent to commence
enforcement of any Transaction Security, such group of creditors must deliver a copy of the proposed
instructions as to enforcement (the “Proposed Enforcement Instructions”) to the Security Agent and the Creditor
Representative for each of the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate). The
Security Agent shall promptly notify each Creditor Representative of the Super Senior Creditors, the Existing
Notes Trustee and each of the Pari Passu Representatives upon receipt of such Proposed Enforcement
Instructions.

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received any Proposed Enforcement
Instructions, then the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security in
accordance with the instructions of the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (and the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders shall be the Instructing Group for the purpose of “—Enforcement instructions” above, in each case,
acting through their respective Creditor Representative) provided that such instructions are consistent with
certain Security Enforcement Principles (as referred to below) and failure to give instructions will be deemed to
be an instruction not to take Enforcement steps.

162


-----

In the event that:

(a) from the date that is three months after the date upon which the first Proposed Enforcement
Instructions (including such instructions not to take Enforcement steps) are delivered, the Security
Agent (acting on the instructions of the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders) has not taken any
Enforcement Action of the Transaction Security; or

(b) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of the date upon
which the first such Proposed Enforcement Instructions (including any such instructions not to take
Enforcement steps) are delivered,

then (with effect from the date of the earlier to occur of such events), the Majority Super Senior Creditors shall
become the Instructing Group for the purposes of “—Enforcement instructions” above.

If at any time the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action of the Transaction
Security notwithstanding the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, a
Creditor Representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders, as the case may be, may at any time provide immediate instructions as to Enforcement to the Security
Agent. If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith
(and notify the Creditor Representatives of the other Super Senior Creditors and the Notes Creditors and the Pari
Passu Creditors and the Security Agent) the delay in taking Enforcement Action of the Transaction Security
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security,

and the Security Agent shall act with respect to the relevant asset or Debtor that is the subject of the
determination pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, in accordance with the first such notice of determination and
instructions as to Enforcement received by the Security Agent (provided in each case that such instructions are
consistent with certain Security Enforcement Principles (referred to herein)).

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any Debtor or Security Provider (other than
an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to
the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the
instructions received from such Majority Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent
has received Proposed Enforcement Instructions from the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security
Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari
Passu Required Holders until such time as the Creditor Representative for the Majority Super Senior Creditors
issues enforcement instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such
prior instructions given by the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

Other than where the preceding two paragraphs apply, if, prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (in each case, acting reasonably)
consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a manner that is not consistent with the
Security Enforcement Principles (as referred to herein), the Creditor Representatives for the relevant Super
Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors shall give notice to the Creditor Representatives for the other Super
Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate), after which the Creditor Representatives for the
other Super Senior Creditors, the Existing Notes Trustee and each Pari Passu Debt Representative shall consult
with the Security Agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the relevant Creditor Representatives
may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement provided that such Creditors’ Representatives
shall not be obligated to consult in the manner referred to in this paragraph more than once in relation to each
enforcement action.

After the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions provided by the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

**_Limitation on enforcement of shareholder liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Shareholder Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement action in
respect of such liabilities prior to the last to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured

163


-----

Discharge Date and the Senior Unsecured Notes Discharge Date (the “Final Discharge Date”) save that, prior to
the Final Discharge Date and after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any Debtor or member of
the Group or grantor of Transaction Security, each such Creditor may only (unless otherwise directed by the
Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf
of that Creditor in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), and shall, if so directed by the
Security Agent, exercise any right it may otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Shareholder Liabilities or declare them prematurely due
and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member
of the Group in respect of any Shareholder Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Shareholder Liabilities of
that member of the Group; or

(d) claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the Shareholder Liabilities owing to
it,

but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Limitation on enforcement of Intra Group Liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Intra Group Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement action in
respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date except that, prior to the Final Discharge Date and after
the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Group or grantor of Transaction Security,
each Intra Group Lender may only (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent
has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Intra Group Lender in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) and shall, if so directed by the Security Agent, exercise any right it may
otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that Group member’s Intra Group Liabilities or declare them prematurely due and
payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member
of the Group in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities of
that member of the Group; or

(d) file claims, or claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the Intra Group
Liabilities owing to it, but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Security Enforcement Principles_**

A Creditor Representative may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with the following
security enforcement principles (the “Security Enforcement Principles”):

(a) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to achieve
the security enforcement objective, such objective being to maximize the recovery by the Super Senior
Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors so far as such recovery is consistent with prompt and
expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Transaction Security (the “Security
Enforcement Objective”);

(b) without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will be enforced and
other enforcement action will be taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as further described in “—Application
_of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security”); or_

(ii) in the case of enforcement by the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, sufficient proceeds from
Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are
applied in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and_
discharged in full in cash (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise);

164


-----

(c) to the extent that the Transaction Security that is the subject of the proposed enforcement action is:

(i) securing assets other than shares in a member of the Group where the aggregate book value of
such assets exceeds EUR 1 million (or its equivalent); or

(ii) over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group,

then the Security Agent shall, if requested by the Instructing Group, and at the expense of the Issuer (to the extent
that financial advisors have not adopted a general policy of not providing such opinions) appoint an
internationally recognized investment bank or accountancy firm or, if it is not practicable for the Security Agent
to appoint any such bank or firm on commercially reasonable terms (including for reasons of conflicts of interest)
as determined by the Security Agent (acting in good faith), another third-party professional firm that is regularly
engaged in providing valuations in respect of the relevant type of assets (in each case not being the firm
appointed as the relevant Debtor’s administrator or other relevant officer holder) selected by the Security Agent
(a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert that the consideration received from any disposal is fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances (a “Financial Advisor’s Opinion”);

(a) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of
a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. Prior to making
any appointment of a Financial Advisor, the Security Agent is entitled to ensure that cost cover (at a
level it is satisfied with, acting reasonably) has been provided;

(b) the Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation
to any other enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security
Enforcement Objective has been met;

(c) where the Instructing Group is the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor’s Opinion where sufficient Proceeds from
Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are
applied in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of proceeds
_from Enforcement of Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in_
full; and

(d) in the event that an enforcement of the Transaction Security is conducted by way of Public Auction (as
defined below), no Financial Advisor shall be required to be appointed, and no Financial Advisor’s
Opinion shall be required, in relation to such enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall be
entitled (but not obligated) to appoint a Financial Advisor to provide such advice as the Security Agent
deems appropriate in relation to such enforcement by way of Public Auction.

The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Existing Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders
of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt and the Security Agent.

“Public Auction” means an auction or other competitive sale process of assets, by or on behalf of the
Security Agent pursuant to an enforcement of Transaction Security (or by a member of the Group in
circumstances that are a Distressed Disposal (as defined herein)), the process of such sale or disposal having been
conducted as follows:

(a) prior to the sale or other disposal, the Security Agent shall, in respect of such auction or other
competitive sale process, consult with an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting
firm selected by the Security Agent (acting reasonably) with respect to the procedures which may
reasonably be expected to be used to obtain a fair market price in the then prevailing market conditions
(taking into account all relevant circumstances and in order to facilitate a prompt and expeditious sale
at a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions although there shall be no obligation to
postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price);

(b) the Security Agent shall have implemented (to the extent permitted by law) in all material respects the
procedures recommended by such bank or firm in relation to such auction or process;

(c) the Secured Parties shall have a right to participate; and

(d) HoldCo shall not have the right to participate without the consent of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (excluding the Hedge Counterparties), the Existing Notes Required Holders and the Pari

165


-----

Passu Debt Required Holders of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt if such auction or competitive sale
process is in respect of SUN Shared Security or assets that were secured by such SUN Shared Security
before foreclosure thereof.

For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above:

(i) the Security Agent shall be entitled to retain any such internationally recognized investment bank
or accounting firm as its and/or any of the other Secured Parties’ financial advisor to advise and
assist in the proposed sale or disposition for such remuneration as the Security Agent in good faith
determines is appropriate for the circumstances;

(ii) except as required by applicable law, the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to any
person to engage in or to use reasonable efforts to engage in a listing of any or all of any equity
interests the subject of such auction or other competitive sale process, including, without
limitation, if recommended by such investment bank or accounting firm; and

(iii) by reason of certain prohibitions, or exemptive or safe-harbor provisions from such prohibitions,
contained in law or regulations of any applicable governmental authority, the Security Agent may,
with respect to any sale of all or any part of such equity interests or assets:

A. limit purchasers to those who meet the requirements of such governmental authority or
exemptive or safe-harbor provision (as applicable) and/or make representations and
undertakings satisfactory to the Security Agent relating to compliance with such
requirements and/or provisions; and/or

B. limit purchasers to persons who will agree, among other things to acquire such shares for
their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof;

(iv) the Security Agent and other Secured Parties shall not under any circumstances be required to
make representations, warranties or undertakings to any actual or proposed purchaser (other than
customary representations in a security enforcement as to power to transfer the relevant equity
interests pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents) or to indemnify any actual or proposed
purchaser against any costs, liabilities or similar expenses or losses; and

(v) without limitation to the other circumstances of the sale or other disposition that the Security
Agent and such investment bank or accounting firm may take into consideration, the Security
Agent may (but is not required to) in all circumstances specify that no offer to purchase equity
interest or other assets will be entertained unless such offer:

A. is for all (and not some only) of the equity interests being sold or otherwise disposed;

B. is for cash consideration payable at closing (and therefore not including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any element of deferred compensation) and is not subject to any financing conditions;
and/or

C. contemplates a closing of the sale of the equity interests or other assets in not more than three
(3) months (or such longer period as the Security Agent may specify) from the time of
initiation of the sale or disposition process; and

(vi) a “right to participate”:

A. means any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that a Secured Party makes shall be
considered by the Security Agent or such investment bank or accounting firm against the
same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential
bidder. For the avoidance of doubt, if after having applied that same criteria, the offer or
indication of a potential offer made by a Secured Party is not considered by the Security
Agent or such investment bank or accounting firm to be sufficient to continue in the sale or
disposal process, such consideration being against the same criteria as any offer, or indication
of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder (such continuation may include
being invited to review additional information or being invited to have an opportunity to
make a subsequent or revised offer, whether in another round of bidding or otherwise) then
the right to participate of that Secured Party under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be
deemed to be satisfied; and

166


-----

B. shall not apply if the Security Agent believes in good faith that it may (or there is a risk that it
may) result in a violation of any applicable laws or that it may (or there is a risk that it may)
result in a requirement for registration under any applicable securities laws.

For the purposes of paragraph (a) above, such investment bank or accounting firm may be instructed by the
Security Agent to take the limitations set out in subparagraphs (i) to (vi) (inclusive) above into account and to
formulate recommendations that are consistent with them.

**_Exercise of voting rights_**

Each Creditor (other than the Credit Facility Lenders, the Revolving Credit Facility Agent, the Existing
Notes Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee) will cast its vote
in any proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of
any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as
instructed by the Security Agent and the Security Agent shall give instructions for these purposes as directed by
the Instructing Group, provided that such instructions have been given in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Turnover_**

_Turnover by Primary Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any creditor in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities, the
Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the Existing Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities or the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities (the “Primary Creditors”) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of
any Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency event) other than in accordance with the
payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security,” that
Primary Creditor will, subject to certain exceptions:

(a) in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold that amount in
trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the
amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Turnover by Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors and Subordinated Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor or any creditor of any
Subordinated Liabilities receives or recovers:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of, or in relation to any such liabilities that is not
otherwise permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or made in accordance with the payment
waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(b) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any amount by way of set-off
in respect of any such liabilities which is not otherwise permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or
which does not give effect to a payment or enforcement action which is otherwise permitted to be
made, received or taken by the relevant creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any amount on account of, or
in relation to, any of such liabilities after the occurrence of an Secured Debt Acceleration Event or the
enforcement of any Transaction Security (a “Distress Event”) or as a result of any other litigation or
proceedings against a Debtor or a member of the Group (other than after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in respect of that Debtor or that member of the Group), other than, in each case, any
amount received or recovered in accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;_

(d) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any amount by way of set-off
in respect of any of such liabilities after the occurrence of a Distress Event; or

167


-----

(e) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any distribution in cash or in
kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of such liabilities that is not made in
accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of
_Transaction Security” below and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an insolvency_
event in respect of that Debtor,

the relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor or Subordinated Creditor (as applicable) will, subject to certain
exceptions:

(i) in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (A) hold that amount
on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) promptly pay an amount equal to the
amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts received from the realization or enforcement of all or
any part of the Transaction Security will be applied in the following order of priority:

(a) first, pari passu and pro rata in or towards payment of: (A) any sums owing to the Security Agent or
any delegate appointed by the Security Agent or any receiver, any Pari Passu Debt Representative in
respect of any Pari Passu Debt issued in the form of notes, any amounts owing to the Existing Notes
Trustee, any Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amounts payable to the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee
and (B) the liabilities owed to the Revolving Credit Facility Agent and each Creditor Representative (to
the extent not included in the foregoing and excluding any Hedge Counterparty in its capacity as its
own Creditor Representative) of any unpaid fees, costs, expenses and liabilities (and all interest thereon
as provided in the relevant finance documents) of each such Creditor Representative and any receiver,
attorney or agent appointed by such Creditor Representative under any Transaction Security Document
or the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent that such Transaction Security has been given in favor of
such obligations);

(b) second, pari passu and pro rata in or toward payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the holders
of Super Senior Liabilities and the holders of Senior Secured Liabilities in connection with any
realization or enforcement of the Transaction Security taken in accordance with the terms of the
Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of
the Security Agent;

(c) third, pari passu and pro rata in or toward payment to: (i) the Revolving Credit Facility Agent on
behalf of the Revolving Credit Facility finance parties and on behalf of the arrangers under the
Revolving Credit Facility and each Creditor Representative in respect of a Credit Facility on behalf of
the arrangers and lenders under and in respect of that Credit Facility; and (ii) the Hedge Counterparties
in respect of the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, for application towards the discharge of (A) the
Credit Facility Lender Liabilities and related liabilities owed to the arrangers under the Revolving
Credit Facility and the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities and related liabilities owed to the arrangers

Security, the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee or proceeds from a Distressed Disposal in relation to
assets that were previously secured by such SUN Shared Security, in payment or distribution to each
Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee on behalf of the Senior Unsecured Noteholders or, if there is no Senior

168


-----

Unsecured Notes Trustee acting on behalf of any relevant Senior Unsecured Noteholders, such Senior
Unsecured Noteholders for application towards the discharge of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities
owed to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders (in accordance with the terms of the Senior Unsecured
Notes Documents); and the balance, if any, in payment or distribution to the Security Providers, any
member of the Group or any other party entitled to receive it.

**_Release of the Guarantees and the security_**

_Non-Distressed Disposal_

In circumstances where a disposal of an asset of the Group which is subject to the Transaction Security is
not being effected (a) by enforcement of the Transaction Security; (b) at the request of the Instructing Group,
after the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (c) in the case of a disposal to a person or persons
outside the Group, after a Secured Debt Acceleration Event or a Distress Event has occurred (each a “Distressed
Disposal”) and is otherwise permitted by the Credit Facility Documents, the Existing Notes Documents, the Pari
Passu Debt Documents and the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents (together the “Senior Debt Documents,” and
such disposal, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent is
authorized (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document over the
relevant asset; and (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release the Transaction
Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document over the assets of that Debtor and the shares in and
assets of any of its subsidiaries, provided that if an asset which is the subject of a Non-Distressed Disposal is
transferred to another member of the Group the release of the Transaction Security must be permitted under the
terms of the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents and, to the
extent that replacement Transaction Security is required from the transferee under the terms of the Debt
Documents, such Transaction Security will (subject to any other requirements relating to the release, retaking,
amendment or extension of the Transaction Security under the Debt Documents) be granted at the same time as
(or before) the relevant disposals are effected.

If any proceeds from a Non-Distressed Disposal are required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of any
of the Secured Liabilities or to be offered to any Secured Party pursuant to the terms of the Secured Debt
Documents, then such proceeds will be applied in or towards payment of such Secured Liabilities or shall be
offered to the relevant Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of the relevant Secured Debt Documents and
the consent of any other party will not be required for that application.

_Distressed Disposal_

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
Security Agent is authorized: (a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to
release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor; (ii) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt
Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Primary Creditors), its liabilities as
guarantor in respect of the Debt Documents and any trading or other liabilities it may have to an Intra Group
Lender or another Debtor (“Other Liabilities”); and (iii) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor or another
Debtor over the relevant assets; and (b) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a holding
company of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that holding company and any
subsidiary of that holding company; (ii) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed
by the Issuer to the Primary Creditors), its liabilities as guarantor in respect of the Debt Documents and any
Other Liabilities; and (iii) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over the relevant assets.

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the
Security Agent is authorized:

(a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a holding company of a
Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities of that Debtor or holding company or any
subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company under the Debt Documents (other than borrowing
liabilities owed by the Issuer to a Primary Creditor) or any liabilities owed by such Debtor, holding
company or subsidiary to another Debtor (“Debtor Liabilities”):

(i) if the Security Agent does not intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any

-----

agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or all (but
not part) of such Debtor Liabilities; or

(ii) if the Security Agent does intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor
or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any agreement to
dispose of all (but not part) of such liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor and all or any part of
such Debtor Liabilities and any other liabilities under the Debt Documents, on behalf of the
relevant creditors and Debtors.

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the
Security Agent is authorized, if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a
holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent decides to transfer to another
Debtor all or any part of that Disposed Entity’s obligations (or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity) in respect of Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities, to enter into any agreement to agree the transfer
and acceptance of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on
behalf of the Debtors that owe such liabilities and the Debtors to which such liabilities are to be transferred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market
price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have an obligation to postpone
any Distressed Disposal or any disposal of Liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If on or after the first date on which Senior Unsecured Notes are issued but before the Senior Unsecured
Notes Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantees
will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

A. the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee has approved the release on the instructions of the
Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders; or

B. where shares or assets of a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(ii) all present and future obligations owed to the Secured Parties under the Credit Facility
Documents, Hedging Agreements, the Existing Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt
Documents by a member of the Group, all or part of whose shares are pledged or charged in favor
of the Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such enforcement action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the Transaction
Security Documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of
a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

C. the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the finance parties under
the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Note Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors
(respectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged; and

D. the Credit Facility Agent, Existing Notes Trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) serve
a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same, in which case the
Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such purchaser
(or an affiliate of such purchaser); and

(i) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(ii) pursuant to a Public Auction; or

(iii) where a Financial Advisor confirms that the sale, disposal or transfer price is fair from a financial
point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, although there shall be no
obligation to postpone any such sale, disposal or transfer in order to achieve a higher price.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities owed to a
Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction
_Security,” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent_
that any disposal of liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities has occurred, as if that
disposal of liabilities or Debtor Liabilities had not occurred.

control with any Debtor other than an Independent Debt Fund, will be considered as though not outstanding

171


-----

except that for the purpose of determining whether the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee will be protected in
relying on any such direction, approval, waiver or consent, only Senior Unsecured Notes that the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee knows are so owned will be disregarded.

**_Amendment_**

In addition to customary minor, technical or administrative matter amendments by the Security Agent, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that it may be amended with only the consent of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, the Existing Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders, the Senior Unsecured

provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement; (c) certain provisions relating to the giving of instructions to
the Security Agent or the exercise of discretion by the Security Agent; or (d) the amendment of provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, which shall not be made without consent of:

(i) the Credit Facility Lenders;

(ii) the Existing Notes Trustee (acting in accordance with the terms of the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indenture);

ranking, immunities or protections of the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee or the Senior Unsecured
Noteholders;

(iv) in the case of any Pari Passu Debt constituting an issuance of debt securities, the relevant Pari Passu
Debt Representative (acting in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents);

(v) in the case of any Pari Passu Debt constituting a credit facility, the Pari Passu Creditors in that tranche
of Pari Passu Debt;

(vi) each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the
Hedge Counterparty);

(vii) the Issuer; and

(viii) the Security Agent.

If, however, an amendment, waiver or consent affects only one class of Secured Party and could not
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the interests of the other classes of Secured Party, only
agreement from the requisite affected class is required.

Subject to the paragraphs above and certain other exceptions, no amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor
Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any party to the
Intercreditor Agreement without the prior written consent of the affected party.

**_Option to purchase: Notes Creditors and Pari Passu Creditors_**

After a Distress Event, by giving not less than ten days’ prior written notice to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agent and, if applicable, the Hedge Counterparties, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Creditor
Representative, at the direction and expense of and having obtained all necessary approvals from the Existing
Noteholders and Pari Passu Creditor Representative(s) (as applicable) (the “Purchasing Senior Secured
Creditors”), will have the right to acquire or procure that a nominee acquires by way of transfer all (but not part
only) of the rights and obligations of the Credit Facility Lenders and the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in
respect of Super Senior Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (the “Super Senior Acquisition
Debt”). If more than one Purchasing Senior Secured Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Super
Senior Acquisition Debt, each such Purchasing Senior Secured Creditor shall acquire the Super Senior
Acquisition Debt pro rata, in the proportion that its principal amount outstanding under the Existing Senior
Secured Notes and its principal amount outstanding under the Pari Passu Debt Documents (“Senior Secured
Credit Participations”) bears to the aggregate Senior Secured Credit Participations of all the Purchasing Senior
Secured Creditors.

Any such purchase will be on terms which will include, without limitation, payment in full in cash of an
amount equal to the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities then outstanding and relevant hedging purchase amount (as

172


-----

determined in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), including in respect of any broken funding costs, as
well as certain costs and expenses (including legal fees) of the Super Senior Creditors and Super Senior Hedge
Counterparties; after the transfer, no Super Senior Creditor or Super Senior Hedge Counterparty will be under
any actual or contingent liability to any Debtor or any other person under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Credit
Facility Document or any Hedging Agreement (in relation to Super Senior Hedging Liabilities only) for which it
is not holding cash collateral in an amount and on terms satisfactory to it; the purchasing holders of Existing
Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Creditors (other than the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s)) indemnify each Super Senior Creditor and Super Senior Hedge Counterparty for any actual or
alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount received by such Super Senior Creditor or Super Senior
Hedge Counterparty; and the relevant transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, any Super Senior
Creditor, save that each Credit Facility Lender and Super Senior Hedge Counterparty will be deemed to have
given the following representations and warranties on the date of the transfer:

(a) in the case of a Credit Facility Lender, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party
interests (other than any arising under the relevant finance documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the Revolving Credit Facility finance documents or the Credit Facility
Documents purporting to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(b) in the case of a Super Senior Hedge Counterparty, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and thirdparty interests (other than any arising under the relevant Hedging Agreements or by operation of law)
of all rights and interests under the relevant Hedging Agreements purporting to be transferred by it by
that transfer;

(c) it has the power to enter into and make, and has taken all necessary action to authorize its entry into
and making of, that transfer;

(d) the Credit Facility Lenders and Super Senior Hedge Counterparties are satisfied with the results of any
“know your client” or other similar checks relating to the identity of any person that they are required
by law to carry out in relation to such a transfer; and

(e) the Senior Unsecured Noteholders have not exercised the purchase rights described in “—Option to
_purchase: Senior Unsecured Noteholders” below or, having exercised such rights, have failed to_
complete the acquisition of the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities under the
Hedging Agreements, the Existing Notes Liabilities and the Pari Passu Liabilities.

**_Option to purchase: Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

The Senior Unsecured Noteholders (the “Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors”) may, after a
Distress Event, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee
and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) (together, the “Relevant Representatives”), require the transfer to them
(or to a nominee or nominees) of all (but not part only) of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the
Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Acquisition Debt”). If more than
one Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Senior Secured
Acquisition Debt, each such Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor shall acquire the Senior Secured
Acquisition Debt pro rata, in the proportion that its principal amount outstanding under the Senior Unsecured
Notes Documents (“Senior Unsecured Credit Participations”) bears to the aggregate Senior Unsecured Credit
Participations of all the Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors.

Any such purchase will be on terms that will include, without limitation, payment in full in cash of an
amount equal to the Secured Liabilities then outstanding, including in respect of any broken funding costs, as
well as certain costs and expenses (including legal fees) of the creditors in respect of the relevant Secured
Liabilities; after the transfer, no Credit Facility Lender, Hedge Counterparty, Existing Notes Creditor or Pari
Passu Creditor will be under any actual or contingent liability to any Debtor or any other person under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Credit Facility Document, any Hedging Agreement, any Existing Notes Document
or any Pari Passu Debt Document for which it is not holding cash collateral in an amount and on terms
satisfactory to it; the Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors, other than the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee (or if required by the Credit Facility Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Noteholders or Pari Passu Creditors,
a third party acceptable to the Credit Facility Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Notes Creditors or Pari Passu
Creditors), shall provide on the date of the transfer an indemnity to each Credit Facility Lender and each other
finance party under such Credit Facility Document, Hedge Counterparty, Notes Creditor or Pari Passu Creditor
(each, an “Indemnified Party”) for any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount received by

173


-----

such Indemnified Party; and the relevant transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, any Primary
Creditor, save that each such Primary Creditor will be deemed to have given the following representations and
warranties on the date of the transfer:

(a) in the case of a Credit Facility Lender, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party
interests (other than any arising under the Credit Facility Documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the Credit Facility Documents purporting to be transferred by it by that
transfer;

(b) in the case of a Hedge Counterparty, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party interests
(other than any arising under the Hedging Agreements or by operation of law) of all rights and interests
under the Hedging Agreements purporting to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(c) in the case of an Existing Notes Creditor, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third- party
interests (other than any arising under the Existing Notes Documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the Existing Notes Documents purporting to be transferred by it by that
transfer;

(d) in the case of a Pari Passu Creditor, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party interests
(other than any arising under the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents purporting to be transferred by it by
that transfer;

(e) it has the power to enter into and make, and has taken all necessary action to authorize its entry into
and making of, that transfer; and

(f) the transferring Primary Creditors and Hedge Counterparties are satisfied with the results of any “know
your client” or other similar checks relating to the identity of any person that they or any
Representative are required by law to carry out in relation to such a transfer.

enforcement of the collateral securing the Existing Senior Secured Notes are subject to limitations under
applicable laws and may be released under certain circumstances. The Existing Senior Secured Notes also have
substantially the same covenants and events of defaults as the Senior Secured Notes.

under the heading “—Certain definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,”
references to the “Issuer” refer only to Parts Europe S.A. (formerly Autodis S.A.) and not to any of its
Subsidiaries, references to “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, references to
the “Parent Guarantor” refer only to Parts Holding Europe S.A.S. (formerly Autodis Group S.A.S.) and not to
any of its Subsidiaries, references to “Luxco 6” refer only to Dakar Acquisition S.A. and not to any of its
Subsidiaries, references to “Luxco 5” refer only to Dakar (BC) LuxCo S.à r.l. and not to any of its Subsidiaries,
and references to the “Sponsor SPVs” refer only to Luxco 6 and Luxco 5.

The Issuer will issue €175.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due
2022 (the “Senior Secured Notes”) under the indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Senior Secured
_Notes Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, the Additional Guarantor, the Sponsor_
SPVs, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such capacity the “Trustee”), and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited,
as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not incorporate by
reference or otherwise or include terms of, or be subject to any of the provisions of, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Senior Secured Notes” refers to “book
entry interests” in the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the Collateral as
described under “—Security.”

The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the Offering (i) to fund the Existing Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes Redemption; (ii) to repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility; (iii) for
general corporate purposes; and (iv) to pay the fees and expenses Incurred in connection with the Refinancing.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, and the Issuer may
issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”),
having identical terms and conditions as the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
from time to time after this Offering. The Issuer will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes
in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including the covenants
restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain
_covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens”)._

Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes issued in
this Offering and, if issued, any Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional_
Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important
to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the
indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover
obligations, release of security and guarantees and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security
Agent. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of
certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description
of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the
Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not
be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

   - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-entry, delivery and
_form”)._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after
certain super senior priority obligations have been repaid in full, including (i) obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that
is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the
Collateral and (iii) certain future Hedging Obligations (if any).

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes will be Guaranteed,
jointly and severally, by the Parent Guarantor and the Additional Guarantor (each, a “Guarantor” and each such
Guarantee, a “Notes Guarantee”). In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain
_covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the_
future.

The Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

   - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including such Guarantor’s obligations
under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future Hedging
Obligations, if any);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor,
including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and future Hedging Obligations (if any) that
is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of
such property and assets; and

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness, including obligations to trade
creditors, of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

178


-----

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable
law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, under
French corporate benefit rules, the Notes Guarantee of the Additional Guarantor is expected to be limited in
value to an amount not greater than the outstanding amount under certain proceeds loans, which is currently
€282 million and corresponds to the aggregate of the proceeds loan made available to on-lend the proceeds of
prior issuances of the Existing Senior Secured Notes to the Additional Guarantor. Other Indebtedness of the
Guarantors may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior
_Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the_
_Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the_
_Senior Secured Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness_
_and the Senior Secured Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case_
_may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Senior Secured Notes, and may limit your_
_ability to enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the_
_Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be_
subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior_
Secured Notes Indenture and will not Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

As of September 30, 2018, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had €967.7 million of third-party borrowings, €175.0 million of which is represented by
the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, there would have been €90.0 million available for drawing under the
Revolving Credit Facility.

**Principal and maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €175.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior
Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will
not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not
be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly,
equal to the sum of (i) three month EURIBOR plus (ii) %, as determined by the Calculation Agent.
Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on February 1, May 1, August 1,
and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2019. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the
holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual
number of days lapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating
to the calculation of interest on the Senior Secured Notes.

“Calculation Agent” means a financial institution appointed by the Issuer to calculate the interest rate
payable on the Senior Secured Notes in respect of each interest period, which shall initially be Elavon Financial
Services DAC, UK Branch.

179


-----

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date;
_provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate_
or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each
of four major banks in the euro zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such
bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time,
on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative
Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be
the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent
will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s
rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination
Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such
rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than such
rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately
preceding Interest Period.

“euro zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro as
currency.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on
and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that
the first Interest Period shall commence on, and include, the Issue Date and end on, and exclude, May 1, 2019.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace
that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans European Automated Real Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination
Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Senior
Secured Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be
calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Senior Secured Floating Rate Note
outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of
days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365. All percentages resulting from any of the above
calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five
one millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to
4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation
Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no
event will the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.

**Methods of receiving payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its
nominee).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for_
such purposes in the City of London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the
option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of
Holders of Senior Secured Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the
_Senior Secured Notes” below._

180


-----

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes in London. The initial
Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial
Services DAC, UK Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Secured
Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Senior
Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes without
prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying
Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes will be, including any
payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, Guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors.

The Guarantors also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain
guarantee limitations as set out therein.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding equity
investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) generated 6.1% of our
consolidated revenue and 33.3% of our consolidated EBITDA and as of September 30, 2018, accounted for
33.5% of our consolidated total assets (excluding equity investment in wholly-owned Subsidiaries and
intercompany receivables and loans).

In addition, as described below under “—Certain covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that Guarantee the
Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain other Indebtedness permitted under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture may also be required under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to enter into a supplemental indenture
as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions or to comply with corporate
benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, under French corporate
benefit rules, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors which are subsidiaries of the Issuer and the
amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds
of the Senior Secured Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any
indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under
intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by
such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. As a consequence, in particular, the Guarantee of the Additional
Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the aggregate amount outstanding
under certain proceeds loans, which is currently €282 million and corresponds to the aggregate of the proceeds
loan made available to on-lend the proceeds of prior issuances of the Existing Senior Secured Notes to the
Additional Guarantor. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—
_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security_
_Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or_
_security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured_
_Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be_
_favorable to creditors, including investors in the Senior Secured Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your_
_rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” In addition, the_
validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the
limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability
_of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the Issuer depends on the
cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.

181


-----

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those
Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if
any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior
Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade
creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than any Guarantors)
and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As at and for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2018, the total assets (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans), revenue and EBITDA of the non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries represented 93.9%, 66.7% and 66.5% of the consolidated revenue, consolidated EBITDA and
consolidated total assets of the Parent Guarantor, respectively, and, after giving pro forma effect to the
Refinancing, the non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries would have had €89.7 million of Indebtedness. Although
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. See “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Notes Guarantees release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than the Parent Guarantor) will terminate and release upon:

   - a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of any Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company as a result of which such
Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially
all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

   - the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as provided in
“—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

   - in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

   - as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

   - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”; or_

   - with respect to a Guarantor that is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation
or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—
_The Subsidiary Guarantors.”_

The Notes Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor will terminate and be released upon the circumstances
described in the third, fourth and fifth bullet point set forth above and under “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation—The Parent Guarantor.”_

Upon any occurrence giving rise to the release of a Notes Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject
to the receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, shall take all
reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Trustee without any additional consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of
the Trustee.

182


-----

**Transfer and exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without
interest coupons, as follows:

   - The Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes
will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

   - The Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

   - Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

   - Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully
under “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in
Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to
customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a BookEntry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will
become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive
Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and
will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under
“Transfer restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000
in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other
things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of
the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to

183


-----

pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer (as defined herein).

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be
Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and certain
perfection requirements, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over:

(1) all issued Capital Stock of Luxco 6 held by Luxco 5;

(2) all issued Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor;

(3) the Parent Guarantor’s material bank account and the Parent Guarantor’s material intragroup
receivables;

(4) all issued Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings);

(5) certain assets of the Issuer, including the Capital Stock of the Additional Guarantor, Magenta Auto
Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, the Issuer’s material bank accounts and the Issuer’s
material intragroup receivables;

(6) the Capital Stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest
S.A.S. held by the Additional Guarantor;

(7) the Additional Guarantor’s material bank accounts; and

(8) the Additional Guarantor’s material intragroup receivables (collectively, the “Collateral”).

The assets that comprise the Collateral also secure on a first-ranking basis the obligations of the Issuer and
the Guarantors under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future
Hedging Obligations. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under
“—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the
relevant security providers will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future
issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Senior Secured
Notes, as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral only after certain super senior priority obligations have been repaid in full,
including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with
respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain future Hedging Obligations.

184


-----

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the
Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.”
All Collateral will be subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the Issuer,
the Guarantors, and the Sponsor SPVs, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain
exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate
the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part
of the Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash
dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits
or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing).

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and
the Existing Senior Secured Notes as well as certain Hedging Obligations and may also secure any Additional
Senior Secured Notes and certain future Indebtedness, certain of which is entitled to payment from the proceeds
of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Senior Secured Notes. The proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Senior Secured Notes
on the Issue Date. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at
all. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—The value of the
_Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior_
_Secured Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

**Priority**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain future Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee and
the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain
other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, which provides, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, certain future Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by
first-ranking Security Interests; provided, however, that the Holders of Senior Secured Notes will only receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain super senior priority obligations have been paid in
full, including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with
respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain future Hedging Obligations. See
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness, including Indebtedness that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior
Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral. See “—Release of Liens,”
“—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain definitions—Permitted Collateral
_Liens.”_

**Security Documents**

Under the Security Documents, the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents

185


-----

will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties.
When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of
the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time).
Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security
Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, including France, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of security interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created
under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in
certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured
_Notes—The security over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.”_

Each of the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall procure that each of their
respective Subsidiaries shall, at their own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such
assurances as the Security Agent may require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral
in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security
Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for
facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for
facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver
of all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall
procure that each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments
and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and
directions which the Security Agent may request.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that the Security Documents may be enforced only in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide and the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent
will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through
the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. Each Holder, by accepting a Senior
Secured Note, appoints the Security Agent as its agent under the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as
such. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any
rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The
Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in
accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture without requiring any consent of the Holders.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by Security Interests in
the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have
been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Sponsor SPV’s, the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency,
bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge
to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders
may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**Enforcement of Security Interest**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will restrict and the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the
Holders and the Trustee, on behalf of the Holders, to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of
the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging counterparties and certain future indebtedness

186


-----

permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank senior
to the Senior Secured Notes. These limitations are described under “Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” The ability to enforce may also be_
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security
Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders
of Senior Secured Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and, by accepting a
Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties
and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and
discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement
expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; agreement to be bound**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without
any further consent of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give
effect to the provisions described in the section entitled “Description of certain financing arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by
accepting such Senior Secured Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents.

See the sections entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—
_The security over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes” and_
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**Release of Liens**

The Collateral will be released from the Liens over such Collateral under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock” or is otherwise permitted in
accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that
this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts
receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted
Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject
to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Senior Secured Notes following such sale or
disposal (and subject to the Agreed Security Principles);

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

187


-----

(3) as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets,
and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) with respect to the Collateral granted by the Sponsor SPVs only, as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “Certain covenants—Maintenance of Double Luxco Structure”;

(7) in respect of Collateral granted by a Sponsor SPV, upon a Change of Control (other than in the context
of an enforcement of Collateral granted by a Sponsor SPV not involving a release in accordance with
the next paragraph below); or

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with
an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
(b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest.”_

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action requested by the
Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in
accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or the relevant Security Document, as applicable. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of
the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be
entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of Liens has occurred, and that such release complies
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Optional redemption**

The Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of 100.000% of the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes to
be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Any such redemption may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent. In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the
notice of redemption may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (provided, however, that, in any case, such redemption date
shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given), or such redemption may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied
by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes at a price
of at least 100.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to, but not including, the applicable tender settlement date, if Holders of Senior Secured Notes of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the
Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such purchase at a price equal
to the price offered to each other Holder of Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not
included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, such
redemption date.

188


-----

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Senior Secured Notes. Any such
purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to
one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such
consideration as the Issuer or any such Affiliate may determine.

**General**

The Issuer may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market
or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice” below. If the optional
redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the
close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured
Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

**No sinking fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes.

**Redemption at maturity**

On May 1, 2022, the Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been previously redeemed
or purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**Selection and notice**

If fewer than all Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Senior Secured Notes are in definitive registered
form, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis,
unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar
will not be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For Senior Secured Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for
communication to entitled account Holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. If and for so long as any
Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the
Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the relevant Senior
Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a
Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will
be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Secured Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or
portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for taxation reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and

189


-----

unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due and which
will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuer determines
in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a
“Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would
be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor,
only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can
make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided
by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a
new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and
become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a
Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior
Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such
successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been
satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures
available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of internationally recognized standing and
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to
the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in
Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without further inquiry on such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including
the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional

190


-----

amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder
(or beneficial owner) in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such
deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have
been received by each Holder (or beneficial owner) in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note
or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant
Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a
citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment
in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or
the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any
such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner
or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent
the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior
Secured Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date on
which the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that
the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Notes been
presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the Senior
Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment by or on behalf of
a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant
Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state
of the European Union;

(7) any Taxes imposed pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or otherwise
imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as of the Issue
Date (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any regulations or
agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any similar law or regulation implementing
an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or
settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have
been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior
Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies or other reasonable

191


-----

evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available
to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available during office hours at the offices of the Paying
Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying
Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such
Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and (where applicable) reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future
stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from
the execution, delivery, issuance, registration, initial resale, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect
to any Senior Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, or any other document
or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured
Notes after this Offering and limited, solely to the extent of such Taxes or similar charges or levies that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Senior Secured Notes, to any such Taxes or
similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to
any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—Change
_of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000_
or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior Secured Notes of €100,000 or less may
only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided,
_however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Secured Notes as described under this_
heading “—Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to
redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional
_redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

192


-----

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes and given
notice of redemption as described under “—Optional redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver
a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the
Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control
Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to
accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased (including
that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the
close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a
facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes delivered for purchase and proof of such delivery or holding, and a statement that such
Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Senior Secured Notes purchased); and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) an Officer’s
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior
Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent)
the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions
thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal
in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that
each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to
the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control
Offer.

-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to
repurchase Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from
seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of
Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is
made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of
Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition,
certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a
mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain
prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer
to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s
then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Senior
_Secured Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_
_Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_
_Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Senior Secured Notes_
_Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

In addition, in the case of an event that constitutes a Change of Control, the definitions of “Change of
_Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction_
which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require
the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect

194


-----

to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and
(2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 5.0 to 1.0; provided
that the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this paragraph by
Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors will not exceed the greater of €20.0 million and 2.6% of Total
Assets.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a
maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of
€60.0 million and 75% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any
Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

(2)

(a) (i) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred

Subsidiary of Indebtedness of any joint venture in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not exceeding the greater of €15.0 million and 1.9% of Total Assets; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the obligee is not the
Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and if the aggregate principal amount of
such Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor exceeds €10.0 million, to the extent legally
permitted (the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in
the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons
from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such
Indebtedness) and except if in respect of intercompany current liabilities Incurred in the ordinary
course of business in connection with the cash management operations of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, it is expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable
Notes Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
and any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be;

(4)

(a) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior Secured
Notes) and any “parallel debt” obligations related to the Senior Secured Notes under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as well “parallel debt”
obligations related to any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this Senior
Secured Notes Indenture;

195

under the Revolving Credit Facility or Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this paragraph)
outstanding on the Issue Date (including the Existing Senior Secured Notes);

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clauses 4(a), 4(b),
this clause 4(c), (5) and (13) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant;

(d) Management Advances; and

(e) any loan or other instrument that is subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes
in compliance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture contributing or on-lending the
proceeds of any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (including for the avoidance of doubt, Parent Senior Notes) to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer; provided, however, that (i) any such proceeds that are so received or
contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first
paragraph and clauses (1), (6), and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below
under “—Limitation on restricted payments”;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or
otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related
liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds
utilized to consummate a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which (i) any Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or
(ii) any assets are acquired and related liabilities are assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other
transaction and after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness, (x) either (A) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness and (y) to
the extent that the Indebtedness Incurred under sub-clause (b) of this clause (5) constitutes Senior
Secured Indebtedness, either (A) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Senior
Secured Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than it
was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness;

Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (a) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money
Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase
price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used or useful in a Similar
Business or (b) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design,
construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or
useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any
Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such
Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding,
will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of €15.0 million and 1.9% of Total Assets; provided

by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of
financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum liability of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds,

effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

(10)

(a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or

-----

are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the

under “—Limitation on restricted payments” to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
Incurs Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or
contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the
extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and
clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_restricted payments” in reliance thereon;_

(14) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any CICE Financing in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness
in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause
(14) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of €45.0 million and 5.6% of Total Assets; and

(15) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness consisting of local lines of
credit or working capital facilities not exceeding the greater of €15.0 million and 1.9% of Total Assets.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) (a) all Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant that is secured
by a Lien on the Collateral that is accorded super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of
enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
may not be reclassified, and (b) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Revolving
Credit Facility shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may
not be reclassified;

(3) in any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any provision of this
covenant or secured pursuant to the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens” is or may be based
on Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA, the amount that may be Incurred and/or secured under such
provisions shall be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace,
restructure, defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant or secured pursuant to the covenant set forth in
“—Limitation on Liens,” the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
and/or secured pursuant to this covenant and/or the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens” shall
not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result
of fluctuations in the amount of Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding
that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue);

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),
(11), (13), (14) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of
credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

198


-----

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(9) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant, nor to be the
Incurrence of a Lien under the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Lien
securing such originally Incurred Preferred Stock or Indebtedness was secured in accordance with the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
(a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and
(b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent (the “Euro Equivalent”) of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated
in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever
yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided
that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than
euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated
at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”;
(b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the
euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in
euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that
is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured
Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no
Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of
the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with
different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of
waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on restricted payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s
or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or
in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any
such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its Capital Stock
other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any direct or
indirect Parent of the Issuer held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than
in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire
for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any
Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment,
purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other
than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person (each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase,
redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to
in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted Payment”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make Restricted Payments, if at
the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer would have been permitted to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect,
on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; and

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made subsequent
to the Existing Senior Secured Notes Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted
Payments (as defined below) permitted below by clauses (5) and (17)(b) of the second succeeding
paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph)
would not exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from the first

amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are (i) no less favorable in
any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of
Senior Management of the Issuer) or (ii) customary in comparable financings and where, in the case of

make principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in each case, that impose

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, together
with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in
effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) or (b) constituting an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as a
permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration
of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
_Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce_
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by
the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day, if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been
entered into after an Asset Disposition), or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds €20.0 million, the Issuer will be required within ten Business Days thereof to make an
offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and
any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case
of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants
contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders
or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among
the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of
calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be
calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected
by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset
Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period
of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later

208


-----

than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
_Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it_
elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition
_Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior_
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that
such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the
terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not
later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a
new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent),
upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note
will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so
accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by
virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the
expiration of the 365-day (or 545-day, as applicable) period mentioned in this covenant.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of €7.5 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €15.0 million, the
terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the
majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on restricted payments” and any agreement related to such Restricted Payments or any Permitted_
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11) and (14) of the
definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Capital Stock, options, other equity-related
investments or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise
pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting,

replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the
extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and
performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to
which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax return,
or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or
management purposes in the ordinary course of business; provided that payments under such Tax
Sharing Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described under
clause (7) of the definition of “Parent Expenses” and that the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services which are
fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the
Issuer (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or an Associate or similar entity, including any joint
venture, that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock, or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated
Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their
reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any

Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;
_provided further that such Subordinated Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified, will_
be deemed to be Subordinated Shareholder Funding for all purposes under the indenture;

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) to the Trustee from an Independent
Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
from a financial point of view or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a
comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

connection therewith);

favorable terms and (iii) in the case of securities, the investment constitutes less than 5% of the issue
amount of such securities, and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such transaction is
with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders) and such Affiliates are treated
no more favorably than all other holders of such class generally.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following
report:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2018, (a) annual reports containing: (i) information with a level and type of detail that is
substantially comparable in all material respects to information in the sections entitled “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “Business” in the Offering_
Memorandum; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent
Guarantor together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to
which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous
report pursuant to clause 2(b) or (2)(c) below); provided that such pro forma financial information will
be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the
Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iii) the
audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent Guarantor as at the end of the most recent two fiscal
years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Parent Guarantor
for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for
and as at the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements; (b) a description of the management and shareholders of the Parent Guarantor, all material
affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt instruments; (c) a description of material risk
factors and material subsequent events; and (d) Consolidated EBITDA; provided that the information
described in clauses (b), (c) and (d) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial
statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Parent Guarantor, beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2019, quarterly financial statements
containing the following information: (a) the Parent Guarantor’s unaudited condensed consolidated

211


-----

forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent Guarantor, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates;
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available_
without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material
acquisition, acquired company financials; and (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor announces
publicly or any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director
changes at the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor or a change in auditors of the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor, a report containing a description of such event,

_provided that the reports required in each of clause (1) and (2) above shall include in such report a reasonably_
detailed description of material differences between the financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and the
Issuer for any period after the Issue Date.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also post such
report on the Issuer’s website. The Issuer will also provide copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through
(3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, to the Listing Agent.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be
described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may,
in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as
provided below, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or any Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not
of a type included in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to
contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Parent Guarantor’s (a) total revenue or
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent quarter for which annual or
quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer or any Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if
filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications,
exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such
Parent, as applicable, is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

The Issuer may comply with the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant by providing
consolidated financial information and reports of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries instead of the Parent Guarantor.
The Issuer may also comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant
by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer (if such entity is

212


-----

different from the Parent Guarantor) so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) (a) meet the
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2) of this covenant as if references
to the Parent Guarantor therein were references to such Parent and (b) include condensed consolidated financial
information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Issuer on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the foregoing
requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent or IPO
Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated
markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Paris Stock Exchange) and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO
Entity is subject to the Admission and Disclosure Standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to
trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of
equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange or the Paris Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would
be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange pursuant to such Admission and Disclosure Standards (or
the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or
the Paris Stock Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided, that
such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Paris Stock Exchange, as applicable, the
Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports” covenant is for
informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

**_Merger and consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer,
lease, sell or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
_Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European_
Union, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province
of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume,
(a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as
applicable, would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;
and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and

213


-----

such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that in the case of the Successor Issuer, such supplemental
indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding
agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the
predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “Merger
_and consolidation—The Issuer” covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted_
Subsidiary of the Issuer.

_The Parent Guarantor_

The Parent Guarantor will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign,
convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Parent Guarantor is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Parent Guarantor”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Parent Guarantor (if not
the Parent Guarantor) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to
the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Parent Guarantor
under its Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Parent
Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents (or the Successor Parent Guarantor shall have entered into security documents creating
Liens over the relevant Collateral on substantially the same terms as the corresponding Security
Documents then in force), as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Successor Parent Guarantor as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Parent Guarantor or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and

(3) the Parent Guarantor or the Successor Parent Guarantor, as applicable, shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, in the case of the Successor
Parent Guarantor, such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each
case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion
of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor, which
properties and assets, if held by the Parent Guarantor instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or

214


-----

substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent Guarantor on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to
be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent Guarantor.

The Successor Parent Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Parent Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or its Notes Guarantee.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

_The Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement substantially
concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition)
will, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease, sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the other Person is the Issuer or, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any Restricted Subsidiary that is

Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of

materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders, and none of the Sponsor SPVs, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall not permit

Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity,
mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Sponsor SPVs, the Parent Guarantor, Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i) and
(ii) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or
otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the
Trustee, either (a) a solvency opinion, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial
Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, (b) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Issuer or the relevant Person granting such
Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (c) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or
Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released,
modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its
satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Revolving Credit Facility) unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on
which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
substantially in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee
would be inconsistent with the Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result
in (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules
or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses
Incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures
pursuant to clause (2) undertaken in connection with, such Notes Guarantee which cannot be avoided through
measures reasonably available to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes
Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor’s liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize
certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantees release.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (1) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or (2) there is no Indebtedness
of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred
in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not
designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

221


-----

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Certain insolvency law considerations
_and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other
than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness
referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives)
an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same
terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or,
in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
protections, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the
consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further
secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and
ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee and Security Agent shall
be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below
under “—Amendments and waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties,
liabilities, protections, indemnifications or immunities under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction
would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on restricted payments.”

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note,
shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior
written request at our offices.

**_Payments for consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to
be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Senior Secured Notes for or as in inducement to
any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
the Senior Secured Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Senior
Secured Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents
relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent,
waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes, to exclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where the solicitation of such
consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or the payment of the
consideration therefor, would require the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to file a registration statement,
prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United
States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its
sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it
would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially
similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such
jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Suspension of covenants on achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status
and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have Investment
Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture summarized under the
following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on restricted payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock”;

(6) the provisions of clause (3) of the covenant described under “—Merger and consolidation—The
_Issuer”;_

(7) “—Maintenance of Double Luxco Structure”;

(8) “—Limitation on the Sponsor SPVs”;

(9) “—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

(10) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary,”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be effective
and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action
taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The covenant set forth under
“—Limitation on restricted payments” and the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension_

223


-----

Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant set
forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” and (b) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the
second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries.”_

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in
the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as
the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior
Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the
conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification
shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee
shall not be obliged to notify Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a Reversion
Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Status.

**_Financial calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in
each case in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio
and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for
such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro
forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such Limited Condition
Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for
purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes
of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets
or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Total
Assets or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination
and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not
be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time
of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided that if the Issuer elects
to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions
(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred
on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any
baskets or ratios under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the
consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following will be an “Event of Default” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any Sponsor SPV or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply
for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with the agreements contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any

224


-----

Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default: (a) is caused by
a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of
the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or (b) results in the acceleration of
such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration provision”), and, in each case the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates €25.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”) (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Permitted Reorganization);

(6) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of €25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days
after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) with
respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of €10.0 million for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the release of any
such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, or any
such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable
and any such Default continues for ten days;

(8) any Notes Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor or a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to
be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or the
Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for ten days; and

(9) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a Sponsor SPV, as applicable, to comply with the
provisions of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain covenants—Centre of main
_interest,” “—Certain covenants—Maintenance of Double Luxco Structure,” “—Certain covenants—_
_Limitation on the Parent Guarantor” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on the Sponsor SPVs.”_

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and
the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to be
due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due
and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an
Event of Default described in clause (4) under the immediately preceding paragraph has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or
cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default
shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior
Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

225


-----

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security
Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. Additionally, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall not include any provisions
incorporating, giving effect to, or otherwise reflecting the provisions of Section 316(b) of the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing
Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the
payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the
Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense
caused by taking or not taking such action. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest
when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the offer of such
security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a
Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must
give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee
may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred

226


-----

during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and
what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default
is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default
will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver
any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed
to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable,
even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in
certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction in its sole discretion. It
may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and,
accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an
indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one
series of Senior Secured Notes, only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the relevant series
of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (and not the consent of the holders of the majority of all Senior
Secured Notes), as the case may be, shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) of this
paragraph, 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes affected (or alternatively,
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes held by such Holder only, the consent of an affected Holder) (provided,
_however that if any amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one series_
of Senior Secured Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) of this
paragraph, 75%) of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding will be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held
by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the time at
which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional
_redemption”;_

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if
any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under
“—Withholding taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in
any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a
loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation
to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

227


-----

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, changes to the governing law of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes shall be permitted pursuant to the first sentence of the first paragraph of this section
entitled “Amendments and waivers.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material
respect under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer) for the
issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for a Notes Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Additional Guarantees,” to
add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of
the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of
any Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment
in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior
Secured Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that
such provision in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to be a verbatim
recitation of a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior
Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or
Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or
Security Agent to any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility, in
any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect
on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required

228


-----

to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) as provided in “—Certain covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”; or

(11) to provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior
Secured Notes (provided that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are issued in registered form for
purposes of 163(f) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code).

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates
and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the issue will
be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults
and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal
defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_covenants—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant
Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision (other than in respect of the Issuer) and the
security default provision described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Secured
Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment
of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other
than with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and the Sponsor_
SPVs), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash_
in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the

229


-----

opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as
the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an opinion of tax counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the
relevant Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such

Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law occurring after the Issue
Date);

reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior
Secured Notes and surviving rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain Senior
Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released
to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due
and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in
the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee
(or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money or eurodenominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient
to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior
Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may
be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and all sums payable to the Trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at
maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
“Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1),
(2), (3) and (5)).

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,

230


-----

such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the
SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and certain agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which
a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any agent becomes the Holder, beneficial
owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not the
Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such Agent.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be
removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by
giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest
that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may
petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any
loss, liability, Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Each such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be deemed to have been given on the later date of its publication and the seventh day
after being so mailed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above,
it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed six years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency indemnity and calculation of euro-denominated restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors,
if any, under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer,
any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from

231


-----

the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the
extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that
other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that
date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Senior Secured Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify
the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the
Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give
rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of
a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in
full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any
sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for
permission to be granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be
no assurance that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be
approved or that permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the
Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to jurisdiction and service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York, County and State of New York, United States. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that
the Issuer, the Sponsor SPVs and each Guarantor appoint CT Corporation System as their agent for service of
process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured
Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New
York. For the avoidance of doubt, changes to this “Consent to jurisdiction and service” paragraph may be
effected pursuant to the first sentence of the paragraph entitled “—Amendments and waivers.”

**Governing law**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the
avoidance of doubt, changes to this “Governing law” paragraph may be effected pursuant to the first sentence of
the paragraph entitled “—Amendments and waivers.”

clause (4) of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on the Parent Guarantor” or clause
(4) of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on the Sponsor SPVs,” less the amount of

statements of the Issuer are available. In the event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs,
assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness
subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being
calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated
giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer)
to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of
Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter reference period and may give effect to cost savings or cost reduction synergies that have
occurred; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred
on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant set forth
under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any
Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions
described in the second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions and Investments that have been made by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
including through mergers or consolidations, or any Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are
Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and including all
related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are
Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or
prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on or substantially concurrently with the
Calculation Date or with all or a portion of the proceeds of any Indebtedness Incurred on the
Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible
accounting or financial officer of the Issuer) as if they had occurred on the first day of the reference
period;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date,
will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period
(taking into account anticipated cost reduction synergies resulting from any such disposal, as
determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer responsible for
accounting or financial reporting);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been
a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any

240


-----

Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of
the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS; and

CICE for the four-quarter reference period as determined on the basis of CICE applicable to all
relevant entities of the Group as at the end of the period, and (ii) the total amount received or
receivable pursuant to CICE already included in Consolidated EBITDA for that period, shall be added
to Consolidated EBITDA.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be
as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (including in respect of
anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies as though the full effect of such expense and cost
reductions and synergies were realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the
reasonably anticipated full run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or
chief accounting officer of the Issuer) of cost savings programs, business optimization programs, centralized
purchasing programs or other restructurings or reorganizations that have been initiated by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries as though programs, restructurings or reorganizations had been fully implemented on the
first day of the relevant reference period (regardless of whether these cost savings and expense and cost reduction
and expense and cost synergies could then be reflected in pro forma financial statements to the extent prepared);
_provided that such anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies and cost savings are reasonably_
anticipated to be realized within 18 months after the consummation of the cost savings program, business
optimization program, centralized purchasing program, restructuring, reorganizations or any operational change
or the purchase or sale or other event which is expected to result in such anticipated expense and cost reductions
and synergies and cost savings), and (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of
determination and Fixed Charges for the relevant period, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence,
repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if such
transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Consolidated EBITDA and all outstanding Indebtedness of any company or
business to be acquired pursuant to a signed purchase agreement (which may be subject to one or more
conditions precedent) may be given pro forma effect for the purpose of calculating the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the
Issuer.

pursuant to clause (4) of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on the Parent
_Guarantor” or clause (4) of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on the Sponsor_

which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available, in each case calculated with such pro
forma and other adjustments as are consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to
(i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second
paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than for the
purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio under clause (5) of the second
paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the
discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds

to the definition of “Change of Control” after the Issue Date.

Secured Notes pursuant to subordination, payment blockage and enforcement limitation terms which

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The
Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common
Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear, and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the
Common Depositary.

Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities
Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global
Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such participants or otherwise in accordance with
applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and any applicable securities laws
of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the
Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on
the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Senior
Secured Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form (each a “Definitive Registered Note”). The
foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while
the Senior Secured Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or
“holders” of Senior Secured Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for
all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or its respective agents and neither the Paying Agent, the
Registrar, nor the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to
the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive
Definitive Registered Notes if:

   - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the
Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor;

   - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture; or

   - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

264


-----

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current
procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Senior Secured Notes in definitive registered
form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer
Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Senior Secured Notes will be
evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a
means of evidencing title to the Senior Secured Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Senior Secured Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a
Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive
Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the
transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing,
printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may
incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or the Paying Agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or its appointed agent) will
authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the
Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity
bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
Registrar appointed pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture from any loss that any of them may suffer if
a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered
Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first
delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Senior
Secured Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

**_Redemption of the Global Notes_**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary
will surrender such Global Note to the Paying Agent for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the
Common Depositary will request the Paying Agent or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the
applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such
partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear

265


-----

and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no
Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**_Payments on Global Notes_**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will in turn make such
payments to the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. We will make payments of all such
amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments
or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required
to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes,”
we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the
Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts
that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest,
as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book- Entry Interests held through such
participants.

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, we, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent
and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the Common Depositary for
Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent or
any of our or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book- Entry Interest;

   - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant; or

   - the records of the Common Depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants.

**_Currency of payment for the Global Notes_**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder of Book-Entry
Interests, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes will be paid to holders of Book-Entry Interests in such Senior Secured Notes through Euroclear
and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of us, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Registrar,
the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

**_Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests_**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of Senior Secured Notes (including the presentation of Senior Secured Notes for exchange as described above)
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes
are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes as to
which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes, each of Euroclear and
Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

266


-----

**_Transfers_**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may
change from time to time. If a holder of Senior Secured Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered
Notes for any reason, including to sell Senior Secured Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of
such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Senior Secured Notes must transfer its interests in the
Global Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed in
“Transfer restrictions.”

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of
the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer restrictions.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor or a written certification (in the form
provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other
jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes
only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and exchange,” and, if required,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable
to such Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly,
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes represented by the Global Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any of our or their
respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**_Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system_**

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no

267


-----

obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of us, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the
Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents will be liable or will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Senior Secured Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement
date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Senior Secured Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems
are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who
wish to transfer their interests in the Senior Secured Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery Senior
Secured Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business
day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing information_**

We expect that the Senior Secured Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear
and Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Senior Secured
Notes are set forth under “Listing and general information—Clearing information.”

**_Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and
we urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in
several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account
holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or

268


-----

entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take action in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. We understand that, under existing
industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if
an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant
Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to
give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive
form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners
of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain French tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain material French tax considerations relating to the purchase,
ownership and disposal of the Senior Secured Notes by an investor who is not a French resident for French tax
purposes, who does not hold the Senior Secured Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed
base in France and who is neither a shareholder of the Issuer nor a related party of the Issuer within the meaning
of Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts).

This summary is based on the French tax laws and regulations, as currently in effect and applied by the
French tax authorities, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different
interpretations.

This summary is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all
of the French tax considerations that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular circumstances.
Furthermore, this summary does not address any French estate or gift tax considerations.

Prospective investors in the Senior Secured Notes are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors as
to the French tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Senior Secured Notes in light of their
particular circumstances.

In addition, Article 1649 AC of the French Tax Code imposes on financial institutions within the meaning
of Article 1 of Decree n°2016-1683 to review and collect information on their clients and investors, in order to
identify their tax residence, as well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign tax authorities
(via the French tax authorities) on an annual basis.

**_Payments of interest and other revenues with respect to the Senior Secured Notes_**

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the Issuer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes
are not subject to the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code unless such
payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif)
within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”). Pursuant to Article
125 A III of the French Tax Code, if such payments are made in a Non-Cooperative State, a 75% mandatory
withholding tax is applicable (subject to certain exceptions, certain of which are set forth below and to the more
favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). The list of Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions is, in
principle, updated each year. A new French law that aims at fighting tax fraud was published on October 24,
2018 (Law 2018-898 of October 23, 2018). This law expands, under certain conditions, the French tax regime
regarding the Non-Cooperative Jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0-A of the FTC to states and
jurisdictions included into the Black List, published and updated at the level of the EU by the Council of the
European Union and thus expands the withholding tax regime to certain states and jurisdictions included in the
Black List.

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and other assimilated revenues on
the Senior Secured Notes may not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to
persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial
institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State. The Law that aims at fighting tax fraud expanded this regime
to the states and jurisdictions included in the Black List published by the Council of the European Union. Under
certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and other assimilated revenues may be recharacterized as
deemed dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case such non-deductible
interest and other assimilated revenue may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the
French Tax Code, at a rate of (i) 75% if they are paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in a
Non-Cooperative State (subject to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty), (ii) 30% if
they are paid to a legal person (it being noted that such withholding tax rate may be progressively reduced) or
(iii) 12.8% in cases where the holder is an individual, in each case, subject to the more favorable provisions of
any applicable tax treaty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax provided by Article 125 A-III of the French
Tax Code nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other revenues relate to genuine transactions and is not in an
abnormal or exaggerated amount, the non-deductibility set out under Article 238 A of the French Tax Code and
the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code which may be levied as a
consequence of such non-deductibility, will apply in respect of a particular issue of notes, if the Issuer can prove

270


-----

that the main purpose and effect of such issuance is not to enable payments of interest or other assimilated
revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

In addition, pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (French administrative guidelines)
referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211 no. 550 and 990, BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40-20140211 no. 70
and no. 80 and BOI-IR-DOMIC-10-20-20-60-20150320 no.10, an issue of notes benefits from the Exception
without the issuer having to provide any proof of the main purpose and effect of such issue of notes, and
accordingly will be able to benefit from the Exception (the “safe harbor”), if such notes are:

   - offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State that is not a Non-Cooperative State. For
this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer
document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or

   - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system,
provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and the operation of
such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other
similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or
entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

   - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing operations of a central depositary or of a securities
clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the
French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators,
provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Senior Secured Notes qualify as debt securities under French commercial law. Considering that (i) as of
the date of their admission to trading, the Senior Secured Notes will be admitted to trading on the Official List of
the Exchange, which does not qualify as a Non-Cooperative State, and that such market is operated by a market
operator that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and/or (ii) at the time of their issue, the Senior Secured
Notes will be admitted to the operations of Euroclear and Clearstream, the Senior Secured Notes will fall under
the Safe Harbour.

Accordingly, payments of interest and other assimilated revenues with respect to the Senior Secured Notes
will be exempt from the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code. Moreover,
under the same conditions and to the extent that the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relating to
genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, they will be subject neither to the
non-deductibility set forth under Article 238 A nor to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the
French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located
in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in such a Non-Cooperative
State.

**_Withholding tax applicable to French tax resident individuals_**

Pursuant to Article 125 A of the French Tax Code (i.e., where the paying agent (établissement payeur) is
located in France), subject to certain exceptions, interest received by French tax resident individuals is subject to
a 12.8% levy withheld at source, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the
year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are
also levied at source at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on interest paid to French tax resident individuals. Holders of
Senior Secured Notes who are French tax resident individuals are urged to consult with their usual tax advisor on
the way the 12.8% levy and the 17.2% social contributions are collected, where the paying agent is not located in
France.

**_Taxation on disposal_**

Pursuant to Article 244 bis C of the French Tax Code, a Noteholder who is not a resident of France for
French tax purposes and who does not hold the Senior Secured Notes in connection with a permanent
establishment or a fixed place of business in France should not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in
France in respect of the gains realized on the sale, exchange or disposal of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Transfer tax_**

No transfer taxes or similar duties are payable in France in connection with the transfer of Senior Secured
Notes, provided that such transfers are not recorded in a deed registered with the French tax authorities and that
the FTT does not become applicable and except in the case of filing with the French tax authorities on a
voluntary basis.

271

**Certain general tax considerations—payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, it is possible that such payments
may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the
provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.

**Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of Senior Secured Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
This summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for the discussion
under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws
other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.
This summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment)
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), by a U.S.
holder who acquires Notes pursuant to this Offering for cash at the price indicated on the cover page of this
Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note that is,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created
or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election
in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a
U.S. person.

This summary is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including provisions of the Code, the
Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of
which are subject to change at any time. Changes in such rules, or new interpretations thereof, may have
retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. We
have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the
conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree
with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of
litigation. A different tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Senior Secured Notes from
those discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect
of an investment in the Senior Secured Notes.

This summary is general in nature and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation or all
tax considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances. In addition, it
does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:

   - tax consequences to holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to
use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions,
individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities and investors in such
entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

   - tax consequences to persons holding the Senior Secured Notes as part of a hedging, integrated,
constructive sale or conversion transaction, or a straddle;

   - tax consequences to a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

   - tax consequences to U.S. expatriates or expatriated entities;

   - tax consequences to persons who are not U.S. holders;

272


-----

   - persons who are resident in France or any other jurisdiction other than the United States or who have a
taxable presence therein;

   - persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our voting stock;

   - alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences of the 3.8% Medicare tax on net
investment income or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax consequences under Section 59A of the
Code;

   - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (within the meaning of
Section 451 of the Code); or

   - any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Senior Secured Notes, the
U.S. tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership considering an investment in the Senior
Secured Notes, or a partner in such a partnership, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes.

The following discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is for informational purposes
only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. If you are considering the purchase of Senior
Secured Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes, as well as the
consequences to you arising under any other tax laws, under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to
changes in tax law.

This summary assumes that the Senior Secured Notes will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

**_Characterization of the Senior Secured Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on
the Senior Secured Notes (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes”) or
make additional payments in redemption of the Senior Secured Notes in addition to their stated principal amount
and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control”).
Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to treat the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or
making additional payments in redemption of the Senior Secured Notes, as not resulting in the Senior Secured
Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This
position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Senior Secured
Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within
the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the Senior Secured Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on
a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which
such U.S. holder acquires the Senior Secured Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is
not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. holder may be
required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of
accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no
contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Senior Secured Notes. In
addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Notes
generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor
regarding the tax consequences of the Senior Secured Notes being treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Senior Secured Notes will not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes (including any non-U.S. taxes withheld from payments thereof and any
additional amounts paid in respect of such withholding taxes) generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as
ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

273


-----

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. holder that receives an interest payment in foreign
currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest
payment denominated in foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the
amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual
period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period
within the taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis
of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual
period, an electing accrual basis U.S. holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by
the U.S. holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable
to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Senior Secured Note) denominated in
foreign currency, an accrual basis U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income
or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate on the date of receipt) in respect of an accrual period and the amount previously accrued during such accrual
period (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Such gain
or loss generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

A U.S. holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes, if any, imposed on interest (including
additional amounts), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit taxes applies to
all of such U.S. holder’s other applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest on a Senior Secured
Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income”
or in the case of certain U.S. holders, “general category income,” or “foreign branch income,” in computing the
foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax
paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in
lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. There are significant
complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of
foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Bond premium_**

If a U.S. holder has a tax basis in a Senior Secured Note that is greater than its principal amount, then the
holder will be considered to have purchased the Senior Secured Note with “bond premium” in an amount equal
to such excess. If a U.S. holder makes (or has made) a proper election under Section 171 of the Code, then such
holder may amortize any bond premium over the term of such Senior Secured Note as an offset to interest
income on the Senior Secured Note, subject to certain limitations when the bond is subject to early redemption at
a premium. Any such election to amortize bond premium will apply to all taxable debt instruments held or
subsequently acquired by such U.S. holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election
applies and cannot be revoked without permission from the IRS. If a U.S. holder makes an election to amortize
bond premium, then the bond premium will be amortizable on a constant yield method over the term of the
Senior Secured Note, subject to certain limitations, and such holder’s tax basis in the Senior Secured Note must
be reduced by the amount of the aggregate amortization deductions allowable for the bond premium. Bond
premium will be computed in euros. An electing U.S. holder may recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the
difference between the U.S. dollar value of the bond premium amortized with respect to a period determined on
the date the interest attributable to such period is received and the U.S. dollar value of that portion of the bond
premium determined on the date of the acquisition of the Senior Secured Notes. If a U.S. holder does not make
such an election, the bond premium will be included in such holder’s tax basis in the Senior Secured Note and,
therefore, such bond premium will be taken into account in computing the gain or loss recognized on such
holder’s disposition of the Senior Secured Note.

274


-----

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Senior Secured Notes_**

If a U.S. holder sells or exchanges a Senior Secured Note, or if a Senior Secured Note that a U.S. holder
holds is retired, such holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount such
holder realizes on the transaction (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest that such holder has
not previously included in income, which amount will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously
included in income) and such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note. If a U.S. holder receives
foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior
Secured Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency
based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of a Senior Secured Note that is considered to be
traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis
U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis
U.S. holders with regard to the sale or other disposition of Senior Secured Notes traded on an established
securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will
recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and
the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss that a
U.S. holder recognizes on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Senior Secured Note generally will be
U.S.-source capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such holder has held the
Senior Secured Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate
U.S. holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Senior Secured Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss, respectively, and generally will be
treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the
“principal amount” of a Senior Secured Note is the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Senior
Secured Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal
amount of the Senior Secured Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the Senior
Secured Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Note, determined at the
spot rate on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note, a U.S. holder may realize exchange gain or loss
attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest, which will be treated as discussed under
“—Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior
Secured Note, a U.S. holder generally will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with
respect to principal amount and accrued interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such
U.S. holder on such disposition.

**_Disposition of foreign currency_**

Foreign currency received as interest on a Senior Secured Note or on the sale, exchange, redemption or
retirement of a Senior Secured Note will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign
currency is received. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale or other disposition of foreign currency (including
their use to purchase Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or
loss.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax shelter
transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an
individual or a trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note.
U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with
respect to an investment in the Senior Secured Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

275


-----

Certain U.S. holders who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value exceeding certain
threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax
returns. The Senior Secured Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the Senior Secured Notes are held in a financial account at certain financial
institutions.

**_U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure_**
**_requirements to their ownership of the Senior Secured Notes, including the significant penalties for_**
**_noncompliance_**

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated interest on the
Senior Secured Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption)
of a Senior Secured Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient (such as a
corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor (which may be us or an
intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments
if: (i) the U.S. holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption
from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the
U.S. holder is incorrect; (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the
Code; or (iv) the U.S. holder has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer
identification number, that it is a U.S. person, and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. holder that it is subject
to backup withholding under the Code.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A U.S. holder may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the
IRS and furnishing any required information.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a “foreign
financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” made after
December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Under
recently proposed Treasury Regulations, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is two years after the date
on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed generally would
be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated
as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Senior Secured Notes only if there is a
significant modification of the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of
this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules
described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Senior Secured Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to
any payments on the Senior Secured Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate
for the withheld amount.

**Certain Luxembourg tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain material Luxembourg tax consequences of purchasing, owning and
disposing of the Senior Secured Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all possible tax situations
that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Senior Secured Notes. It is included herein
solely for preliminary information purposes. It is not intended to be, nor should it construed to be, legal or tax
advice. This summary does not allow any conclusion to be drawn with respect to issues not specifically
addressed. The following description of Luxembourg tax law is based on the Luxembourg law and regulations as
in effect and as interpreted by the Luxembourg tax authorities on the date of this Offering Memorandum. These
laws and interpretations are subject to change that may occur after such date, even with retroactive or
retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular
tax consequences of subscribing, purchasing, holding and disposing the Senior Secured Notes, including the

-----

application and effect of any federal, state or local taxes under the tax laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
and each country of which they are residents or citizens.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy
impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only.
Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le
_revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge_
(contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) and personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu des personnes physiques). A
corporate taxpayer may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune), as well as other duties, levies
or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax, as well as the solidarity surcharge, invariably apply to
most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to
personal income tax and to the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer
acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may
apply as well.

**_Luxembourg taxation of non-resident holders_**

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on business in
Luxembourg solely by reason of the holding, execution, performance, delivery, exchange and/or enforcement of
the Senior Secured Notes.

Subject to FATCA described above, under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, there is no
withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to non-resident holders of Senior Secured
Notes, or on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, nor is any Luxembourg
withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes held by non-resident holders
of Senior Secured Notes.

Non-resident holders of Senior Secured Notes not having a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative with whom the holding of the Senior Secured Notes are connected are not subject to any other
taxation in relation with the Senior Secured Notes.

Non-resident holders of Senior Secured Notes having a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in Luxembourg with whom the holding of the Senior Secured Notes are connected are liable to pay
Luxembourg income tax on any interest received or accrued, as well as any reimbursement premium received at
maturity and any capital gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Senior Secured
Notes and must include this income in their taxable income for Luxembourg tax assessment purposes.

**_Luxembourg taxation of Luxembourg resident holders_**

_Luxembourg resident individuals_

Subject to the discussion of FATCA contained herein, under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in
force, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident
corporate holder of Senior Secured Notes by the Issuer or the Guarantors.

Under the law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the “Relibi Law”), payments of interest or similar
income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for the benefit of an individual
beneficial holder who is resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Responsibility for
the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments of interest under the
Senior Secured Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law would be subject to withholding tax of 20%.

An individual holder of Senior Secured Notes may also opt for the application of a 20% tax in full discharge
of income tax in accordance with the Relibi Law, which applies if a payment of interest on the Senior Secured
Notes has been made or ascribed by a paying agent established in an EU Member State (other than Luxembourg),
or in a member state of the European Economic Area (other than an EU Member State). The option for this levy
must cover all interest payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial owner during
the entire civil year. The Luxembourg resident individual who is the beneficial owner of interest is responsible
for the declaration and the payment of such final levy.

An individual Luxembourg holder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is
subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under
the Senior Secured Notes, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with
the Relibi Law.

277


-----

Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realized upon the sale, disposal or redemption of the Senior
Secured Notes by a Luxembourg holder, who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and who acts in the
course of the management of his/her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this
sale or disposal took place more than six months after the acquisition of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes do not constitute zero coupon notes.

An individual Luxembourg holder, who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and
who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes, must further include the portion of the gain corresponding to
accrued but unpaid interest income in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in his/ her taxable income, insofar as
the accrued but unpaid interest is indicated separately in the agreement, except if a final withholding tax or levy
has been levied in accordance with the Relibi Law.

Luxembourg resident individual holders acting in the course of the management of a professional or
business undertaking to which the Senior Secured Notes are attributable, must include any interest received or
accrued, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Senior Secured Notes, in any form whatsoever,
in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax and municipal business tax assessment purposes. Taxable
gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including accrued but
unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Senior Secured Notes sold or redeemed.

_Luxembourg resident companies_

Luxembourg corporate holders must include any payments, on the Senior Secured Notes received from the
Issuer or the Guarantor (except repayments of nominal), as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the
Senior Secured Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax and municipal business tax
assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption
price (including but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Senior Secured Notes sold or
redeemed.

_Luxembourg resident companies benefiting from a special tax regime_

Luxembourg holders who benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for example, undertakings for
collective investment subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010, specialized investment funds governed
by the amended law of February 13, 2007, family wealth management companies governed by the amended law
of May 11, 2007, or reserved alternative investment fund treated as specialized investment funds for
Luxembourg tax purposes governed by the law of July 23, 2016 are exempt from income taxes in Luxembourg
and thus income derived from the Senior Secured Notes as well as gains realized thereon, are not subject to
income taxes.

**_Net wealth tax_**

Luxembourg resident holders and non-resident holders who have a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which or to whom the Senior Secured Notes are attributable, are subject to
Luxembourg net wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder is (i) an individual, (ii) an undertaking for
collective investment subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010, (iii), a securitization company governed
by the amended law of March 22, 2004, (iv) a company governed by the amended law of June 15, 2004, on
venture capital vehicles, (v) a specialized investment fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007,
(vi) a family wealth management company governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007, (vii) a professional
pension institution governed by the amended law of July 13, 2005 and (viii) a reserved alternative investment
fund vehicle governed by the law of July 23, 2016.

However, (i) a Luxembourg resident securitization company governed by the amended law of March 22,
2004, on securitization, (ii) a professional pension institution governed by the amended law of July 13, 2005, (iii)
a reserved alternative investment fund vehicle (opting for the treatment as a venture capital vehicle) governed by
the law of July 23, 2016, and (iv) and a Luxembourg resident company governed by the amended law of June 15,
2004, on venture capital vehicles shall be subject to the minimum net wealth tax (“MNWT”) charge according to
the amended law of October 16, 1934, on net wealth tax.

The MNWT levied on companies having their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg. For
entities for which the sum of fixed financial assets, transferable securities, such as the Senior Secured Notes, and
cash at bank exceeds 90% of their total gross assets and €350,000, the MNWT is set at €4,815. For all other
companies having their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg which do not fall within the scope
of the €4,815 MNWT, the MNWT ranges from €535 to €32,100, depending on the company’s total gross assets.

278


-----

**_Other taxes_**

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in
Luxembourg by the holders as a consequence of the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, nor will any of these
taxes be payable as a consequence of a subsequent transfer, redemption or repurchase of the Senior Secured
Notes (except in the case of voluntary registration in Luxembourg).

Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual holder is a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax
purposes at the time of his/her death, the Senior Secured Notes are included in his/her taxable base for
inheritance tax purposes. On the contrary, no estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the Senior
Secured Notes upon death of a holder in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for
inheritance tax purposes at the time of his/her death. Luxembourg gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of the
Senior Secured Notes if the gift is recorded in a deed executed before a Luxembourg notary or otherwise
registered in Luxembourg.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security
interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or the Collateral is being provided. It is a summary
only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions
and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes. The application of these
various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Senior Secured Notes,
the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain
aspects of insolvency law in France and Luxembourg.

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Guarantors in France and the security providers in France and Luxembourg are
incorporated under the laws of Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the
“EU Insolvency Regulation”), which became fully effective on June 26, 2017 (except with respect to the
obligation of the Member States to establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings that came into on
June 26, 2018, and the obligation of the European Commission to interconnect such registers that will come into
force on June 26, 2019) and applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of the Member
State in which a debtor’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The
determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member
States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the centre of main interests, or “COMI” of a
“debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a
debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to
another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central
administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive
assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other
Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29,
2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in
determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the
debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the
debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but
is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency
proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary
(territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member
State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for
commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations
where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main
insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”

280


-----

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be
secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced
in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot
be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or
(b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor which is domiciled,
habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation
of the establishment or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the
Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main
or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex
_fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_
proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a
Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is there) may
exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove
assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to
the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
debtor has assets.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main
insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and
insolvency practitioners. It also provides for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in
order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming
part of the same group. As from June 26, 2018, the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of
insolvency proceedings and, as from June 26, 2019, the European Commission shall establish a decentralized
system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers.

**France**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of the Issuer
or any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in France, they could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings
affecting creditors, i.e. mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope of the EU
Insolvency Regulation). In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency
Regulation does not apply, their main centre of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French
Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France or they have an establishment in France, they could also be subject
to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings, accelerated
safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or
_sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial_
liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or
exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in
turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in turnover, and (ii) commencement of proceedings with
respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency
Regulation or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main
center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having
international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific
control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may,
for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all
proceedings in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Senior

281


-----

Secured Notes and/or the Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests in
the Collateral.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France would be
subject to French main insolvency proceedings and any company of our group having an establishment in France
and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary
insolvency proceedings. The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law
for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to
holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Grace periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial
position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment
dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or
rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as
published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment
of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due
during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

**_If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the_**
**_course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted_**
**_proceedings—mandat ad hoc and conciliation” below)._**

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its due debts with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account available
credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court
ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier
date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date
of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an
agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning
of the hardening period (see below).

**_Court-assisted proceedings—mandat ad hoc and conciliation_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court- assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders (e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness).

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice,_
_mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see_
_“—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law. They are carried out under the_
aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under
the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the
_mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or_
her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be
negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by
the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending
proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but
those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so for their duration. In any event,

282


-----

the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French
Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is
not formally approved by it.

Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”) or has not been
insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law. They are carried out under the
aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under
the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur
being able to request a one- month extension). The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in
negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties,
e.g. providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will
be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound
by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending
proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but
those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so for their duration and creditors
may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against
the debtor. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor
retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5
of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on
notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may
condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is
acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate
in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the
debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement,
such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the
implementation of the agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of
the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular,
performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to
obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a
judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the
request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works
council or employee representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is insolvent or the conciliation
agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively
ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the
rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement
(constatation) as described above, except that in addition:

   - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the
amount of any New Money Lien (as defined herein) and the guarantees and security interests granted to
secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except
vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the
conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office
(greffe) of the Court;

   - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services
designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing
new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all
pre-commencement and post-proceedings claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement
employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent
safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

   - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings,
claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and

283


-----

their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or
reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders
general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate);

   - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is transmitted to its
statutory auditors; and

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency test”), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as
defined herein—see “—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and
_liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval_
(homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in the case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de
_l’accord) during its execution, and while the agreement is in force:_

   - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

   - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a
grace period in accordance with Article L.611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code and pursuant to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods”), in relation to claims of creditors
(other than public creditors) party to the conciliation proceedings that are not already subject to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliateur
(provided that the terms of his or her appointment included monitoring the implementation of the
agreement, as referred to above); and

   - a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect
to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as
from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of
the court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation
proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual
proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement
are suspended and/or forbidden. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically
put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the
payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to
meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will be a mandatory preliminary step of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the conciliation proceedings have been
consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or
total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) which
could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings.
Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad
_hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or_
liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being
reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any
specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of
insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed
as from the end of the previous ones.

**_Court-administered proceedings—safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (en état
_de cessation des paiements) (see “—Insolvency test”). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to_

284


-----

attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following
the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is
(except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to
investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the
court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the
outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is
also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate
among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of
the debtor assisted by the court- appointed administrator and overseen by the court. The court-appointed
administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto
control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of
the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_
representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the
safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert such proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) after
commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or
the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) before
commencement of the proceedings, (ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own initiative or upon
request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in the case
where the debtor is insolvent, or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or
the public prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the
bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if
the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end. At any time during the
observation period, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is
insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

(i) the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) above, the court
may act upon its own initiative; and

(ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to
the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for
prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or
to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the
safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by
the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

_Standard consultation: This applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or_
prepared by a chartered accountant, or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million
or less.

In such a case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court- appointed
creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt
remissions and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is
justified by the difference in the situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’

285


-----

representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of
claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum possible length of
the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals where the maximum is
fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than
debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it, except when the proposal includes debt for
equity swap. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the
debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to
them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform
rescheduling of their claims (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over
a maximum period of ten years (except for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the
court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity swap
may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5%
of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the
initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the
amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in
accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

_Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, the accounts of which are certified by a_
statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and
with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s
request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’
committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior
to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

   - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in
favor of the debtor, but excluding noteholders (the “credit institutions committee”); and

   - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the
claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the
court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including
capital market debt instruments such as the Senior Secured Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such
debt securities will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part
irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee. Accordingly,
a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee.

The proposed plan:

   - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

   - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

   - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring
the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the creditors may subscribe to such share capital increase by
way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where
applicable).

286


-----

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may
also prepare an alternative safeguard plan that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the
bondholders’ general meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same
two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by
the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own
alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period
may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority
vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors’ committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform
the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or
(ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The
court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights
in the creditors’ committees/ bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be
ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of
the court-appointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In
addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a
payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do
not need to be consulted on the plan or take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval
to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of
creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved
(arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that
required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the
safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who
did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting are consulted in accordance
with the standard consultation process referred to above.

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting
within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they
reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator
for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the
committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within
the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones
applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the
shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving
access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple
majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least
half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to
quorum and majority shall apply.

If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the bondholders’ general
meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the State
prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears
that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly
lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that
are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed
in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or
mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the

287


-----

framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax
administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. With regard to indirect taxes, relief may only be granted
from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Court-administered proceedings—accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard_**

A debtor that is the subject of conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed
to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those:

   - which publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial
Code; or

   - which publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant
and have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3.0 million (excluding VAT) or
(iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

If the debtor does not exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above), the
court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the
debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

   - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

   - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement
of the proceedings;

   - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a
position to overcome; and

   - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a
going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render
likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial
accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of
three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a month
following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by
an additional month).

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions
committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan
through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying to any creditor to
whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any
amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or
(ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor. Such amounts may be
paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors
other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are
not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and
payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committeebased consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde
_accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and_
creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not
bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “committee-based consultation”)),
to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard
proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two

288


-----

months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions
relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard
or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to vote on the
proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of
accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for
rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their
consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court
shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the
committee process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be
deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as
applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make
such a filing (see below).

**_Court-administered proceedings—judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming
insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have
deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability in the event that judicial
liquidation proceedings should be subsequently commenced against the debtor.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order
the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the
debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial
reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings
observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) or the State prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial
reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the
time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having
heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the
workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation
of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of
share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by
the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months,
and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor with the debtor’s help, or for the sale of the
business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court- appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making
management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management
and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a
manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the
judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to
them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the

289


-----

debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State
prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order
the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the
outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

In judicial reorganization proceedings, if a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’
equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French
Commercial Code, the court may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting
and to vote on behalf of the shareholders who refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring
plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the
reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court- appointed administrator, can order the
total or partial transfer of the business as described below. Any third party (as construed under French insolvency
law) can present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within
the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and (iii) the
modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or
regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then following (x) the
review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or of the State prosecutor and (y) at least three months have elapsed from the court decision
commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of
the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the
insolvency court may either:

   - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share
capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the
reorganization plan; or

   - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or
part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital increase and holding,
directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights
(including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s
shareholders’ meetings; the minority shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and
request that their shares be purchased by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of
the reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which
is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in
judicial liquidation proceedings nor does he law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to
represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities
to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order
for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the
debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

(a) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period
of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and
organize such sale of the business as a going concern via an asset sale, i.e. a sale plan (plan de cession),
any third party being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business); or

(b) a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

(i) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

290


-----

(ii) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude
the sale agreement with the bidder); or

(iii) in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process
whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being
disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility of
implementing such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has
varied.

If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to
the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds
to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due
to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

   - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the
difficulty of selling the assets; or

   - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in
charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits
between the remaining creditors.

**_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months
before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date
earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of
conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the
hardening period (période suspecte), which runs from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court
decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void while others are
voidable by the court.

   - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of
other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration,
contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the obligations of the other
party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of matured debts in a manner which
is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for previously incurred
obligations, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the
attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer
of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made by way of security
for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets
or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and
notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité).

   - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions
for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures
(saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court
determines that the creditor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions
relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the
six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings except if the debtor was in fact already insolvent before the opening of the
proceeding and that the proceeding was ended without the approval of a plan.

291

**_Status of creditors during safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial_**
**_reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of
the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued
operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against
the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract,
diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization
proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909,
which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts
(contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the courtappointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even
though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its contractual
obligations post-filing (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, absent
consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation
proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court
orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business”
(plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration
of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business”
(plan de cession) or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

(a) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment which is deferred for at least one year (however, accrued interest can no
longer be compounded);

(b) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and
payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery
is justified by the continued operation of the business);

(c) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings
unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor;

(d) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered or
goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will
be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain
limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed
within one year of the expiration of the observation period;

(e) creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the
debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated
safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the
court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (i) to obtain an
order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require
that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (ii) to
terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (iii) to enforce the creditor’s
rights against any assets of the debtor except (x) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the
applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or
(v) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable—is located in another
EU Member State, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the
insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation;
and

(f) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en
_cours), will be required._

-----

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors who fall within
the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable
in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales);
this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for
the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to
above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors on whose behalves no claims have been submitted
during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in
connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under
French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’
representative with the list of all of its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the
creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing
of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a
proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They
may also file their own proofs of claim.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of
the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory
auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may
also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as
set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two- or four-months’ time limit). Creditors who did
not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards
the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial
liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditor’s representative) in
charge of selling the assets of the debtor and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. French
insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, postcommencement legal costs (essentially, court officials’ fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien (see
above), post-commencement creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial
liquidation proceedings only, certain pre- commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate
are paid prior to post- commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors,
for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim
related to such asset.

**_Creditors’ liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held
liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was
wrongful, in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or
guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or
guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be
cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

   - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations that would constitute prohibited financial
assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225 216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of
the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and

   - French corporate benefit rules.

293


-----

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from extending credit or guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee
unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient
return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a
real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the
benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors which are subsidiaries of the Issuer and the
amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds
of the Senior Secured Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any
indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under
intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by
such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees
in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the
intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements
referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a French Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the Guarantee, an economic return that is
less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an
arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length
transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on
the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Senior
Secured Notes if we or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these
liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to
take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French
subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges
over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The
securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de
_nantissement de compte de titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each_
statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and
shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are
available for security interests that are not publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on
the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of
a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being
paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the
context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure.
If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the
pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and
the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by
the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

294


-----

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the
vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition
of companies or groups of companies.

**_Security Agent_**

Ordinance n°2017-748 dated 4 May 2017 clarifies and modernizes the status of the French security agent
(agent des sûretés) by repealing former Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code and by creating a new regime for
the agent specifically designated for the purpose of taking, managing and enforcing security interest and personal
guarantees in the context of financing arrangements. This new regime applies to security agents appointed after
1st October 2017. New Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security
interests and personal guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately
from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees
will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in
cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal
actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a
debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying
its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

**_Parallel debt—trust_**

Under French law—prior to the recent reform of the security agent regime, as described above -, the pledgee
of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be
the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured
claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code.

The beneficial holders of interests in the Senior Secured Notes from time to time will not be parties to the
Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Senior Secured Notes to benefit from a
secured claim, there will be provided for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent
(the “Parallel Debt”) that mirror the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (the
“Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt
and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant
to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an
obligor under the Senior Secured Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel
Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the other indebtedness
secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement
actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances
direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed
by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing
of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French
Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel
Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a
recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that
such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue

295


-----

addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French
security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on
a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in
France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the
Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will bear the risks
associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel
Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture that become
particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default (each as defined therein), and acts as trustee in the
interests of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_
n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, inter alia, the Security Agent. To the extent that the
security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from
an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will
bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, action paulienne provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to
which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of such debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the
safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or by any of the creditors of such debtor
outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence
of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third
parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case
of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of
the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction
knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such
knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the
grant of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance
that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the
granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared
unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in
relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Senior Secured Notes may
not enjoy the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and
the value of any consideration that holders of the Senior Secured Notes received with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such
circumstances, holders of the Senior Secured Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced
creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for Article L. 626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that, in the context of
safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or continuation plan which is put to the vote of
the creditors’ committees takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements
between creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no
judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of validity of second or lower ranking financial securities account pledges by French courts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower
ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over
the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company
are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests that are not registered, in official
ledgers such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a
company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account
from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking
pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide
that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers
_convenu” (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the_
creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their
appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking
and the second or lower ranking secured parties. This structure has not been tested before the French courts and
no assurance can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there
is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company
are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially
adversely affect the recovery under the Senior Secured Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an
enforcement event.

**_Assumptions as to the enforceability of second ranking bank accounts pledges over the bank accounts_**

Certain pledges over the bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are
available for security interests that are not registered in official ledgers, such as pledges over bank accounts. As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account from granting
a second or lower ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has not been tested before the French
courts and no assurance can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.

**Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**

The Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and are in principle
also subject to Luxembourg insolvency law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of
Luxembourg insolvency laws.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as “insolvency
proceedings”) may be commenced against a company with a registered office in Luxembourg having its COMI
in Luxembourg or an establishment in Luxembourg within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation (in
relation to secondary proceedings):

   - insolvency proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of
its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may commence insolvency
proceedings if the Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has

297


-----

lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are
satisfied, it may open insolvency proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a
creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against
the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and
the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon foreclosure of the assets;

   - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested
by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a provisional suspension of
payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors. A reorganization order
requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the
relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default
and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not
be enforceable during controlled management proceedings; or

   - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be requested
by the company (subject to obtaining the prior consent of the majority of its creditors holding 75% at
least of the claims against such company) and not by its creditors themselves. The court’s decision to
admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by
creditors.

In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Senior Secured Notes
may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the
Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the
request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in
serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on
commercial companies, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Law”). The management of such liquidation
proceedings generally will follow rules similar to those applicable to insolvency proceedings. Liability of the
Issuer in respect of the Senior Secured Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of such Issuer following
insolvency or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred
for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under
Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

   - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg revenue authorities;

   - value-added taxes and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg customs and excise authorities;

   - social security contributions; and

   - remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is foreclosed upon), and subject to
application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during
the period before insolvency, or the suspect period (période suspecte), which is a maximum of six months from
the date on which the Luxembourg Commercial Court formally adjudicates a person insolvent and, as for specific
payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period
preceding the judgment declaring insolvency, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start
of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the insolvency judgment was preceded by another insolvency
proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law.

In particular:

   - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), specified
transactions (such as the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts that
have not fallen due; whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any
other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by a bill of
exchange; or the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration)
entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null
and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

298


-----

   - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as
well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court
upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the insolvent party’s cessation of payments;

   - regardless of the suspect period, Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167
of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to challenge any
fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the insolvency; and

   - pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral
arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”), a financial collateral arrangement
entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization
measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against third parties,
administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in
Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves that it was
unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or
that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

In principle, an insolvency order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination
of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its
solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the insolvency order. However, the insolvency
receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the
company. As of the date of adjudication of insolvency, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis
the insolvency estate. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg
company’s business and assets and on the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.

The insolvency receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e.,
contracts existing before the insolvency order). The insolvency receiver may elect to continue the business of the
debtor, provided the insolvency receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not
cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

   - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of an insolvency constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; and

   - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts where the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the insolvency judgment
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contracts.

The insolvency receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the insolvent party that are still to be
performed after the insolvency under any agreement validly entered into by the insolvent party prior to the
insolvency. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the insolvency and such claim
will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant
contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

International aspects of Luxembourg insolvency, controlled management or voluntary arrangement with
creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency
Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although
there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has
its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation
states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as
where board meetings are held, the location where a company conducts the majority of its business and the
location where the majority of a company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of
the place where a company has its COMI. The time when a company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the
relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

299


-----

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the
main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in
such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency
proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one
Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the COMI of a debtor is
in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of
another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings” only in the event
that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such
other Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated
in the territory of such other Member State. If a company does not have an establishment in any other Member
State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such
company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the Issuer’s COMI is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such other jurisdictions may have
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Issuer.

**_Security interests considerations_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei
_sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is_
situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a
consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security
interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg
companies, bank account held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or
having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities that are held through an
account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets
will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with
Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of
pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration,
notification and acceptance requirements. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth the following
enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event:

   - the direct appropriation of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation
method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets;

   - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions
_commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public auction;_

   - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following
a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

   - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to
involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security
interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be
enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or
arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or
administrators, might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, particularly where the
Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg
courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except
if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg
law and such security interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member
State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

300


-----

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek
the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges
will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation
of law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by
operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or
unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes, in
particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of
employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (such as
social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This
general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.

**_Financial assistance_**

Any security interests granted by Luxembourg entities, which constitute breach of the provisions on
financial assistance as defined by Article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law or any other similar
provisions, might not be enforceable.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Senior Secured Notes, the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de
l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg is not required. Where the Senior Secured Notes, the Security
Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the transaction documents (and any document in connection
therewith) are (i) voluntarily presented to the registration formalities or (ii) appended to a document that requires
mandatory registration, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the
amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable depending on the
nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest agreements,
which are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral law.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the Senior Secured Notes,
the security documents, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**_Service of process_**

As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters between the United States and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically
recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid judgment against an issuer incorporated
in Luxembourg with respect to the Senior Secured Notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect after all appeals that may be taken in the relevant
state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of
competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur) set
forth in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure
Civile), being:

   - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict
of laws rules;

   - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

   - the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi);

   - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matters under its
applicable rules, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local
law;

   - the judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which the decision has been rendered;

   - the judgment was obtained in compliance with the rights of the defendant, i.e., following proceedings
at which the defendant had the opportunity to appear, was granted the necessary time to prepare its case
and, if it appeared, could present a defense; and

301


-----

   - the judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the laws of
Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law
and notably if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international public policy. In an action brought in
Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite
power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.
Furthermore, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have the power to
give judgment expressed as an order to pay in a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment
against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would
be converted into euro.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

**General**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase agreement dated on the
date of this Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes for resale at the issue price that
appears on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which
the Senior Secured Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell the Senior Secured Notes through certain of their affiliates and agents, including in
respect of sales into the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Senior Secured Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions
by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreements also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in
respect thereof.

Persons who purchase Senior Secured Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,
taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the
issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Sales of the Senior Secured Notes may be made through affiliates
of the Initial Purchasers or through registered brokers.

Investment funds or accounts advised or managed by entities affiliated with Bain Capital, LLC may
purchase Senior Secured Notes in this Offering at a purchase price per Senior Secured Note equal to the issue
price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum and in the case of investment funds registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), subject to the limitations of the 1940
Act. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict the ability of the
funds and the affiliates of Bain Capital, LLC to buy or sell the Senior Secured Notes in the future and, as a result,
these investment funds and affiliates of Bain Capital, LLC may buy or sell Senior Secured Notes, subject to
applicable securities laws, in open market transactions at any time following the consummation of this Offering.

**_Senior Secured Notes are not being registered_**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state securities
laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Senior Secured Notes in the
United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Each purchaser of the Senior
Secured Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations and agreements described under
“Transfer restrictions.” The Initial Purchasers will not offer or sell the Senior Secured Notes except to persons
they reasonably expect to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and sales in offshore transactions
in reliance on Regulation S. Resales of the Senior Secured Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and
will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”))
received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Senior Secured Notes in circumstances in which
section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable
provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Senior Secured Notes in, from or
otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Senior Secured Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Senior

303


-----

Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Senior Secured
Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Senior Secured Notes
may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable
rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer
to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to
inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to this Offering, the distribution of this Offering
Memorandum and the resale of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer,
sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by the U.S. Securities Act or the safe
harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Senior Secured
Notes.

**_No sale of similar securities_**

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guarantee by, the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates (other than any securities issued by any funds managed or controlled by Bain
Capital or entities controlled by such funds that have no relationship or connection otherwise with the Issuer, the
Guarantors or their respective subsidiaries or holding companies but are affiliates solely due to the fact that Bain
Capital has an equity interest in such entity) that are substantially similar to the Senior Secured Notes during the
period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the date of
this Offering Memorandum without prior written consent.

**_New issue of securities_**

Currently there is no public market for the Senior Secured Notes. Application will be made to list the Senior
Secured Notes on the on the Official List of the Exchange. No certainty can be given that this application will be
granted, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes will develop.

The Initial Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the
Senior Secured Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make
a market in the Senior Secured Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the
sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be
subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for
the Senior Secured Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any
Senior Secured Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be favorable to you. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the_
_Senior Secured Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes will be limited.”_

**_Initial settlement_**

We expect that delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made against payment on the Senior Secured
Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be
the business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following
the date of pricing of the Senior Secured Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T ”). Under
Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two
business days, unless the parties to such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the Senior Secured Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the Senior Secured Notes will initially settle in T, to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Senior Secured
Notes who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisors.

**_Price stabilization and short positions_**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Senior Secured Notes. Specifically, the

304


-----

Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may over-allot the Senior Secured Notes or effect
transactions, for a limited period after the Issue Date, with a view to supporting the market price of such Senior
Secured Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager may bid for
and purchase the Senior Secured Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the
price of Senior Secured Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also create syndicate short positions, and may bid
for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in market-making transactions as permitted
by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market
price of the Senior Secured Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not
required to engage in these activities and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be
given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to
_our indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Senior_
_Secured Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes will be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Senior
Secured Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Any such stabilizing
action, if begun, may be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the
Issue Date and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Senior Secured Notes. These transactions
may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_indebtedness and the Senior Secured Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured_
_Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes will be limited.”_

**_Other relationships_**

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and original lenders
under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and our Bridge Facility Agreement and are or will be
counterparties in the hedging arrangements we expect to roll over and carry forward or enter into in connection
with the Senior Secured Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates receive customary fees and
commissions in such capacities.

In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past
and may currently be providing and may provide in the future, investment banking, commercial lending,
consulting and advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have
received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Also, certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective
affiliates have various bilateral commitments and exposures to entities in our Group.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments, securities or financial instruments activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours
or our affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our
affiliates routinely hedge their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions
that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities,
including (potentially) the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short
positions in such securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of
the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby.

**General**

The Issuer will not register the Senior Secured Notes under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities
laws and, therefore, the Senior Secured Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except

Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes are only being offered
and sold:

   - in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” or “QIBs” (as defined in Rule 144A) in
compliance with Rule 144A; and

Consequently, any transfer of the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set
forth under “Plan of distribution.”

(9) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, any offer, sale or

**ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and certain security providers are
incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Each of the documents relating to the Collateral for the Senior
Secured Notes will be governed by the laws of France or Luxembourg, as applicable. The Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Senior Secured Notes are governed by New York law. The
Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law. Some of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer
and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, and those of their respective directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors or any such other person,
including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Senior
Secured Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state
securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and the Guarantors
will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York
courts, in each case in connection with any action in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on
us or on such other persons mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated
upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, the Guarantors or a security provider, investors
will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions in which the relevant company has assets. Even though the
enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the
Issuer, the Guarantors and certain security providers are located, you should consult your own advisors in any
pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**France**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or
principal places of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors, officers and other executives of the
French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore,
most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a
result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to
enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or
state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of
process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad
of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
claims connected with the Senior Secured Notes against French entities and/or French individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a
judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in
France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that
the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

   - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the
choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter;

   - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

   - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

311


-----

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions
(i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment
should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there
is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and
having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res
judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in
France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities
would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French and European data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing,
data files and individual liberties, as amended and Regulation (EU) 2016/479 of April 27, 2016) can limit under
certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection
with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their
contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public
policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on
the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can
sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French individuals. Pursuant to
Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in
connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French
national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other
than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not
mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contact
with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its
rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct
by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of December 12, 2012, regarding legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted
to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person
domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the
privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France,
regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the European
Union. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting
one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any
competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents
would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party
from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Luxembourg**

The Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated and established under the laws of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg. All of their assets are located outside the United States. Furthermore, none of their directors or
managers resides in the United States. As a result, investors may find it difficult to effect service of process

312


-----

within the United States upon the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons or to enforce outside the U.S.
judgments obtained against the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons in U.S. courts, including
judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Likewise, it
may also be difficult for an investor to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against the Luxembourg
Security Providers or these persons in courts located in jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. It may also be difficult for an
investor to bring an original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
U.S. federal securities laws against the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons. Luxembourg law,
furthermore, does not recognize a shareholder’s right to bring a derivative action on behalf of the Issuer.
Furthermore, a contractual provision allowing the service of process against a party to a service agent could be
overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process against a party in
accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes will be governed by the laws of the State
of New York. According to Luxembourg case law, a judgment rendered in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York would be recognized and enforced by a
Luxembourg court, without reconsideration of the merits, subject to the following conditions:

   - the judgment of the U.S. court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

   - the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction according to the Luxembourg conflict of jurisdiction rules;

   - the U.S. court must have applied to the matter submitted to it the proper law designated by the
Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (although some first instance decisions rendered in Luxembourg,
which have not been confirmed by the Luxembourg Court of Appeals, no longer apply this condition);

   - the judgment of the U.S. court must not have been obtained fraudulently, and must have been made in
compliance with procedural rules of the country in which it was rendered and, in particular, the rights
of the defendant; and

   - the judgment of the U.S. court must not be contrary to Luxembourg public policy.

The enforcement in Luxembourg of a judgment rendered in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or the Senior Secured Notes by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York will be subject to the
rules of civil and commercial procedure as applied by the courts of Luxembourg. The term “enforceable” as used
above is subject to all limitations by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, controlled
management, general settlement with creditors, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors of
the Issuer generally.

Furthermore, a foreign jurisdiction clause does not prevent the parties from initiating legal action in
Luxembourg courts to the extent that summary proceedings (référé) seeking urgent provisional measures are
concerned. Finally, notwithstanding a foreign governing law clause, Luxembourg courts would in principle have
jurisdiction over any urgent provisional measures in connection with assets located in Luxembourg and such
action would most likely be governed by Luxembourg law.

**Statutory auditors’ review report of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

To the President,

In our capacity as statutory auditors of Parts Holding Europe and at your request, we have performed a
review of the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period from January 1
to September 30, 2018.

We highlight that the first set of condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Parts Holding
Europe for a nine-month period have been prepared on September 30, 2018, consequently we have not audited
nor reviewed the corresponding figures relating to the period from January 1 to September 30, 2017.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under your responsibility.
Our role is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our
review.

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the
professional guidance issued by the French institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des
_commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement. A review of interim financial information consists of_
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
IAS 34 standard of IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial reporting.

Without modifying the conclusion expressed above, we draw your attention to the matters set out in Notes 2
and 16 to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements regarding the impacts of the first-time
adoption of IFRS 9.

This report shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with French law. The courts of France shall
have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or difference concerning the engagement letter or this
report, and any matter arising from them. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to object to an
action being brought in any of those courts, to claim that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum or
to claim that those courts do not have jurisdiction.

**2 Accounting policies and standards**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Parts Holding Europe SAS and its subsidiaries
for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2018 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34—Interim
Financial Reporting. The accompanying notes therefore relate to significant events and transactions of the period,
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December
2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 prepared within the same framework as described above for the
condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2018. The
accounting policies applied as of 30 September 2018 are identical to those described in the notes to the published
consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December
2015, unless otherwise noted.

The Group classified the bank overdraft of € 18.5 million on acquisition of Italian subsidiaries from
Business acquisition (net of cash acquired) (reduction of cash out flow) to Cash and cash equivalents presented
net in the September 30, 2017 comparative consolidated statement of cash flow (see Notes 9.1.4, 9.2 and 9.3).

The light vehicle and trucks spare parts distribution and repair market in which the Group operates is subject
to seasonal fluctuations. The Group’s results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that
may be achieved for the full financial year. The Group’s quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may
fluctuate in the future, depending upon a variety of factors, including, among other things, shifts in the timing of
holidays, weather conditions, competitive factors and general economic conditions.

Financial data is presented in millions of euros. It is rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise
indicated. In certain cases, rounding may cause non-material discrepancies in the lines and columns showing
totals.

**2.1 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB effective at 30 September 2018**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the consolidated financial
statements for the years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, with the exception
of the adoption of the following new standards and amendments:

**2 Accounting policies and standards (Continued)**

The Group adopted IFRS 9 for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2018 prospectively. The
comparative period presented has not been restated to reflect the potential impact. Refer to the Note 16 for a
detailed description and impact of IFRS 9 on the Group’s financial statements.

**2.2 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB whose application is not mandatory at**
**30 September 2018**

The Group has not elected to early adopt the following new and revised standards published by the IASB
but whose application is not yet mandatory:

**Standards** **Effective date**

**Standards**
IFRIC23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019
Amendments to IFRS 9—Prepayment features with negative compensation . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019
IFRS 16—Leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019

Other standards that were newly issued but are not yet effective at 30 September 2018 are not expected to
have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

The adoption of IFRS 16, which was issued in January 2016, will result in almost all leases being
recognized on the balance sheet by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed.
Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are
recognized. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The group will apply the standard from its
mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. The group intends to apply the simplified transition approach and
will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption. The standard will affect primarily the
accounting for the group’s operating leases. We estimate that the implementation of IFRS 16 should result in our
YTD September 2018 financials in an increase in total assets of approximately €140—€150 million, in total
liabilities of approximately €140—€150 million, and in EBITDA of approximately €28—€30 million. The
group’s activities as a lessor are not material and hence the group does not expect any significant impact on the
financial statements.

**3 Scope of consolidation**

**3.1 Acquisitions and disposals in the current period**

**3.1.1 Q3 2018 acquisitions**

On 31 July 2018, Parts Holding Europe concluded the acquisition by Autodistribution S.A. (a direct

under the equity method, is now fully consolidated by the Group. No gain was recognized on the previously held
interests, whose fair value was €1.25 million on 1 March 2018. The provisional goodwill from the purchase price
allocation is €0.7 million, reflecting the further synergies expected to be derived from the acquisition in terms of
trading and cost savings, increase in market share and growth potential. The entire goodwill was allocated to the
Italian subsidiaries CGU.

**3.2 Acquisitions and disposals in the prior period**

For detailed descriptions of all acquisitions and disposals in the prior periods, please refer to the Note 5.1.1
of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December
2016 and 31 December 2015.

**4 Segment information**

The chief operating decision maker of the Group monitors profitability using revenue and adjusted
EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure which is further defined in the section “Use of adjusted EBITDA” of this note,
for the following operating segments:

   - The Light Vehicles (“LV”) France reportable segment, including headquarter costs attributable to the
LV France segment.

   - The Trucks reportable segment, including headquarters costs attributable to the Trucks segment.

   - The LV International reportable segment, which includes the following entities:

(i) Belgian Doyen Group

F-13

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Segment information (Continued)**

(ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies since May 2017

(iii) Netherland Geevers Group, since June 2018

The Group’s operations in Poland, sold in August 2017, have not been included in this segment.

The central purchasing unit (“CPU”) negotiates purchasing conditions for LV France, Trucks and LV
International, which are then sold to wholly owned distributors and to affiliated independent distributors. As a
result, the CPU’s income statement is broken down between the three segments, primarily based on the detailed
supplier analysis. The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the supplier level and each supplier is identified
as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing truck parts only, providing LV International parts
only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV France, Truck and LV International parts, revenue
and Adjusted EBITDA are further split based on the pro-rata value of the mix of products purchased.

In addition to the three segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose
activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are
directly attributable to one of these segments. Costs that cannot be attributed to one of the segments are presented
in the “Headquarters” column.

**4.3 Use of adjusted EBITDA**

In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, the Group considers a variety of performance and
financial measures. The key measure used for determining how the Group’s business is performing is Adjusted
EBITDA. Management internally assesses the performance and cash flows on a consolidated basis of each
operating segment on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses and adjusted for certain items that the Group believes are non-related to ordinary activities
or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of the business, namely start-up costs related to new
businesses, income and expenses attributable to the implementation of the group transformation plan and the
sponsor fees paid to the shareholders and exceptional one-off expense related to professional conferences.

**5.4 Trade receivables**

Under IAS 39, an impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication
(such as a probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group will not be
able to recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The provision for impairment is
measured according to a certain provision matrix based on days past due of the receivables and actual historical
default rates. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account. The impaired
outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed non-recoverable.

Under IFRS 9, as adopted by the Group as of 1 January 2018, the Group applies the simplified approach
permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the
receivables. For receivables of the Group’s major customers, probability-weighted estimate of credit losses is
recognized based on each customer’s credit ratings. For other remaining receivables, a portfolio approach is
applied to the extent they share credit risk characteristics and provision is recognized according to a certain
provision matrix based on days past due of the receivables and actual historical default rates. The Group
considers receivables to be in default when contractual payment is 91 days past due and trade receivables are
impaired through an allowance account. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable
expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others,
that the trade receivables are more than 181 days past due.

**16 Changes in accounting standards**

This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9—Financial Instruments on the Group’s financial
statements.

**16.1 Impact on the financial statements**

IFRS 9 was adopted without restating comparative information. The reclassifications and the adjustments
arising from the new impairment rules are therefore not reflected in the restated balance sheet as at 31 December
2017 but are recognized in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2018. IFRS9 had no impact in our effective
interest rate regarding group debt valuation.

The following tables show the adjustments recognized for each individual line item. Line items that were

**16.2 Impact of adoption**

IFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of
financial assets and financial liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and
hedge accounting. The adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018 resulted in changes in
accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The new accounting
policies are set out in Note 5.4. In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9, comparative figures
have not been restated.

Based on the analysis, the only financial assets that are impacted by IFRS 9’s new expected credit loss
model are trade receivables and loans receivables. The Group does not hold financial instruments that are
impacted by IFRS 9’s classification standard. As a result, the Group was required to revise its impairment
methodology under IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and loans receivables. The impact of the change in
impairment methodology on the Group’s retained earnings and equity is disclosed below. While cash and cash
equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was
immaterial.

The total impact on the group’s retained earnings as at 1 January 2018 is as follows:

**(in millions of euros)** **2018**

**Closing retained earnings 31 December 2017—IAS 39** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **31.6**
(Increase)/ decrease in provision for trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (1.0)
(Increase)/ decrease in provision for loans receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (0.2)
Increase/ (decrease) in deferred tax assets relating to impairment provisions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.3

**Opening retained earnings 1 January 2018—IFRS 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **30.7**

The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime
expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and loans receivables.

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (Continued)**

**16 Changes in accounting standards (Continued)**

The loss allowances for trade receivables and loans receivables as at 31 December 2017 reconcile to the
opening loss allowances on 1 January 2018 as follows:

**(in millions of euros)** **Trade receivables** **Loans receivables**

**Closing loss allowance at 31 December 2017—IAS 39 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **14.2** **0.1**

**Opening loss allowance at 1 January 2018—IFRS 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **15.2** **0.2**

The loss allowances did not change during the nine months to 30 September 2018.

**Statutory auditors’ report on the IFRS**
**consolidated financial statements**

Years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017

To the President,

In our capacity as statutory auditors of PARTS HOLDING EUROPE and at your request, we have audited
the accompanying consolidated financial statements prepared in the context of the offering of senior secured
notes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards “IFRS” as adopted by the European Union
for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 (thereafter the “IFRS consolidated financial statements”).

These IFRS consolidated financial statements are under your responsibility. Our role is to express an
opinion on these IFRS consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the professional
guidance issued by the French Institute of statutory auditors (Compagnie nationale des Commissaires aux
_comptes) relating to this engagement. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain_
reasonable assurance about whether the IFRS consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures, by audit sampling and other means of testing, to obtain audit evidence
about the amounts and disclosures in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made,
as well as the overall presentation of the IFRS consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the IFRS consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the assets
and liabilities and the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, and the results of
its operations for the years then ended in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.

This report shall be governed by, and constructed in accordance with, French law and professional standards
applicable in France. The Courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, difference or
dispute which may arise out of or in connection with our engagement letter or this report.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1 Preparation and approval of the consolidated financial statements**

After the suspension of its planned initial public offering, Parts Holding Europe (former Autodis Group
SAS) explores other funding options. The consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December
2015, 2016 and 2017 have been prepared within this framework.

On 24 January 2019, the Chairman approved Parts Holding Europe SAS’s consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015. This unique set of consolidated financial statements
covering three years does not replace the historical consolidated financial statements for the years ended
31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015, approved by the Chairman of the Management Board on 11 April 2018,
27 March 2017 and on 31 March 2016, respectively. Events that occurred subsequent to the dates of approval of
the historical consolidated statements for the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 are not reflected in
these consolidated financial statements, in accordance with the decision of the IASB Interpretation Committee
(IFRS IC Rejection – IAS 10 Events After the Reporting Period: Reissuing Previously Issued Financial
Statements of May 2013). In particular, with regard to the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015, these
financial statements do not reflect events occurring after 11 April 2018, 27 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 (date
of approval of the historical financial statements by the Chairman of the Management Board).

These consolidated financial statements include the following changes to the historical consolidated
financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015:

   - Restatements to reflect (i) the first application of IFRS 15, as mentioned in Note 4 and (ii) the disposal
of AD Polska (operations in Poland) in August 2017 accounted for under IFRS 5 “Non-current assets
held for sale and discontinued operations”, as mentioned in Note 4 and Note 5.1.1.4; and

   - Presentation of a new segmentation of the business, as mentioned in Note 6 “Segment information”. In
applying IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, the Group presents the restated segment information for the
prior periods in line with the new organization.

Concerning 2017 figures, the Group has restated by reclassifying the bank overdraft of € 18.5 million on
acquisition of Italian subsidiaries from Business acquisition (net of cash acquired) (reduction of cash out flow) to
Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 presented net on the consolidated statement of cash flow (see
Notes 12.1.6, 12.2 and 12.3).

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Accounting policies and standards (Continued)**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, except for
certain categories of assets and liabilities as indicated, in accordance with IFRS principles.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest
million unless otherwise stated.

**3.1 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB effective at 31 December 2017**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, with the exception of the adoption of the following new
standards and amendments:

**Standards and amendments** **Effective date**

**Standards**
IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers (see Note 4) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2018
**Amendments**
Clarifications to IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers (see Note 4) . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2018
Disclosure Initiative—Amendments to IAS 7 (see Note 12.3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2017

Refer to Note 4 for detailed description of impact of adoption of IFRS 15. Other standards that were newly
effective for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2017 do not have a material impact on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements.

**3.2 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB whose application is not mandatory at**
**31 December 2017**

The Group has not elected to early adopt the following new and revised standards published by the IASB
but whose application is not yet mandatory:

**Standards** **Effective date**

**Standards**
IFRS 9—Financial Instruments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2018
Amendments to IFRS 9—Prepayment features with negative compensation . . . . . . . 1 January 2018 (pending
endorsement by the
European Union)
IFRS 16—Leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019

Other standards that were newly issued but are not yet effective at 31 December 2017 are not expected to
have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

On 24 July 2014, the IASB published the full version of IFRS 9, marking the completion of its project to
replace IAS 39 on financial instruments. IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of
financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model
for financial assets. The Group will apply the new rules prospectively from 1 January 2018, with the practical
expedients permitted under the standard. Comparative information for 2017 will not be restated.

Given the nature of its operations, the Group does not expect the classification and measurement of its
financial assets to change significantly. A detailed analysis of the impairment model for financial assets, and
particularly accounts and notes receivable, was carried out in 2017. The expected credit loss impairment model
prescribed by IFRS 9 results in recognizing impairment losses against accounts and notes receivable not yet due.
The impact of this is not considered material.

On 13 January 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16—Leases and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
9 November 2017. IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and will result in
almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is
eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a
financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 is

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Accounting policies and standards (Continued)**

effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 has
also been applied. The Group plans to adopt IFRS 16 effective 1 January 2019. The standard will affect primarily
the accounting for the Group’s operating leases, with the greatest impact on the financial statements coming from
a few real estate leases while the majority of the lease contracts relates to vehicle leases. As of 31 December
2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of €163.2 million (Note 16.1). The Group is
currently assessing the quantitative impacts of the new lease standard to estimate the amount of right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities that will have to be recognized on adoption of the new standard and how this may
affect the Group’s profit or loss and classification of cash flows going forward.

**3.3 Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain significant
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies.

Estimates are made based on a going concern assumption and on information available at the date of their
preparation. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations about future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. When the Group makes estimates and assumptions
concerning the future, the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual
results.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates
are significant to the consolidated financial statements are:

   - Inventory impairment—Note 7.3

   - End-of-year supplier rebates—Note 7.6

   - Employee costs and benefits—Note 8

   - Impairment of non-financial assets—Note 9.1 and 9.2

   - Deferred tax assets—Notes 13.2

**4 Restatements of previously reported financial statements**

IFRS 15—Revenue recognition

The IASB issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue to replace IAS 18, which covers contracts
for goods and services, and IAS 11, which covers construction contracts. Compared to the assessment of transfer
of risks under IAS 18 and IAS 11, the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when
control of a good or service transfers to a customer. IFRS 15 is effective for financial years commencing on or
after 1 January 2018 with early adoption permitted.

The Group elected to early adopt IFRS 15 effective 1 January 2017, using the full retrospective method,
which requires restatement of each prior reporting period presented. The Group did not elect to use any practical
expedients.

The most significant impact of the standard relates to the sales of spare parts, equipment and tools delivered
directly by suppliers to independent distributors that do not transit through the Group’s logistics platforms as they
are directly delivered by suppliers to independent distributors (referred to as direct sales transactions).
Historically under IAS 18, the Group bears the inventory and credit risks of these products and therefore,
considered a principal in these transactions. Under IFRS 15, the guidance focuses on the transfer of control of the
products rather than the risks and accordingly, the Group is considered an agent, rather than the principal in those
transactions. Therefore for the direct sales transactions, only the net amount that the Group retains as a
commission is recognized as revenue. This accounting better reflects one of the Group’s major strategies to focus
and invest more on the transactions involving its logistics platforms rather than direct flow transactions which do
not pass through the Group’s platforms. The IFRS 15 impacts identified by the Group are mainly driven by the
new principal versus agent application guidance as explained above.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Restatements of previously reported financial statements (Continued)**

The adoption of IFRS 15 resulted in a reversal of cost of goods sold for purchase of goods from the
suppliers and a corresponding reversal of revenue previously recognized for direct sales to distributors for the
same amount. The remaining revenue therefore represents the commission the Group earned for direct sales
transactions, including discounts received from suppliers and discounts given to the distributors. The adoption
therefore had no impact on the Group’s EBITDA, operating income or earnings per share, and had no impact on
the consolidated reserves as of 1 January 2017. Adoption of the standard also did not impact the assets and
liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position nor cash from or used in operating, financing, or
investing on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

IFRS 5—Discontinued operations

Under IFRS 5, a discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group. This component (i) must have been
either disposed of or classified as held for sale, (ii) represents a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations for the Group, and (iii) either is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations or a significant subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of
resale.

Following the sale transaction on 4 August 2017 described in Note 5.1.1.4, AD Polska was classified as
discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS,
the Group’s consolidated income statements for years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 have been restated to
exclude the impact of the disposed business.

All restatements to the previously reported results due to the adoption of the new standard and discontinued
operations on the Group’s consolidated income statements are described below. Note that the analysis of impact
of IFRS 15 adjustments exclude AD Polska as all the impacts are disclosed separately as discontinued operations
on the Group’s consolidated income statements.

**5 Scope of consolidation**

_Consolidation_

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holding Europe SAS and its
controlled entities. Control is assessed as having (i) the power over the investee through voting rights or similar
rights, (ii) exposure to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and (iii) the ability to use power over
the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. Controlled entities are consolidated from the date the
Group obtains control until such time the Group ceases to exercise control.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealized income, expenses, gains and losses that are
included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal transactions are eliminated.

In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in an entity already controlled by the Group, the
difference between the acquisition price of the shares and the additional interest acquired by the Group in
consolidated equity is recorded in stockholders’ equity. The value of the entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities
(including goodwill) for consolidation purposes remains unchanged.

Entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not have control, are accounted for using
the equity method. The investments in such entities are initially recognized at cost, including the goodwill of the
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss, and is subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the
profit or loss in the investee. In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in entities that were previously
accounted for using the equity method that results in the Group obtaining control, the previously held equity
interest is remeasured at fair value and the difference between the fair value and carrying value is recorded as a
gain or loss in the income statement.

When the parent company loses control of a previously consolidated entity, assets and liabilities related to
such entity is derecognized including any goodwill and a gain or loss associated with the loss of control of the
former entity is recognized.

**5 Scope of consolidation (Continued)**

_Foreign currency translation_

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s functional
currency and the currency in which it presents its consolidated financial statements. The financial statements of
entities that use a functional currency other than the euro are translated as follows:

   - assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date;

   - income statement and statement of cash flow items are translated at the average exchange rate for the
year.

The resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity. On
the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the related deferred foreign exchange gains or
losses carried in the separate item of equity is recognized in the income statement.

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign operation are treated as
an asset or liability of the foreign operation and are therefore translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate
prevailing at the transaction date. At the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into euro at the exchange rate prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies and measured at cost are translated into euro at the exchange rate at the date of
the transaction, and those measured at fair value are translated into euro at the exchange rate at the date when the
fair value was measured. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**5.1 Acquisitions and disposals**

Business combinations are recorded in accordance with IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. The
acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS accounting criteria are
recorded at acquisition-date fair value, including any previously held interest but with the exception of
non-current assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets
and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards. The costs directly
attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in which they are incurred.

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where appropriate,
non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s identifiable assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note 9.1 for impairment of goodwill.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities related to acquisitions recorded on a provisional basis are
recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a maximum 12 months of the acquisition
date. After the end of the allocation period, the effects are recorded directly in the income statement unless they
correspond to corrections of errors.

**5.1.1.2 Acquisition of a group of distributors in Italy**

On 10 May 2017, Autodis Italia Holding Srl (“Autodis Italia”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Group in
which the Group holds 55% interests, acquired 100% interests in three leading Italian distributors, OVAM, Top
Car and Ricauto for a purchase price of €29.2 million, paid in cash. The organizational structure post-acquisition
is illustrated as follows:

Parts Holding Europe

100%

Autodis Italia Srl

55%

Autodis Italia Holding Srl

100% 100% 100%

Top Car Ricauto OVAM

49% 100% 60% 54%

Sarco Services Sarpi Sirauto

The 45% non-controlling interests in Autodis Italia are held by the former shareholders of OVAM, Top Car
and Ricauto. Autodis Italia holds call options to purchase the remaining 45% non-controlling interests
exercisable from the date of approval of 2019 annual accounts. Autodis Italia also has the option to purchase, in
part, the shares owned by the CEOs of the three entities, contingently exercisable upon certain conditions and
before the date of approval of 2019 annual accounts. The non-controlling interest holders also have put options to
sell their interests to the Group, which is classified as a liability.

Founded in 1963, OVAM is one of the leading Italian stockist-distributors operating in the north and center
of the country. It operates via three platforms located in Pero (Milan), Brescia and Turin.

Founded in 1973 and 1989 respectively, Ricauto and Top Car are two leading Italian stockist-distributors
operating in Padua, in the north-eastern region of Italy. Due to their long-standing association, together they play
a major role within GIADI, Autodistribution’s purchasing group partner in Italy.

The newly formed Autodis Italia immediately became a member of the AD Italy network, and from the date
of acquisition to end of 2017, contributed €71.4 million to the Group’s revenue and €0.4 million to the Group’s
net loss, and revenue of €103.1 million and net income of €1.0 million over the full year 2017. Leveraging the
financial support of the Group and the operational know-how of its shareholders, the new entity aims to become
one of the national leaders in Italy and to attract new independent distributors. Acquisition cost of the transaction
was €3.0 million.

**6 Segment information**

The reportable segments reflect the segmentation used for internal reporting purposes, which is presented to
the Chief Operating Decision Maker and used for monitoring the operations and the performance of the Group.
Each reportable segment is an operating segment identified in accordance with paragraphs 5-10 of IFRS 8
“Operating Segments”. The chief operating decision maker is responsible for managing resources and assessing
the profitability of each operating segment. The chief operating decision maker of the Group was identified as the
Chairman of the Group in charge of strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker does not review
information regarding the Group’s assets and liabilities.

As early as 2016, the Group’s management began a process of complete separation of its truck activities
from its light vehicle business to better reflect the underlying nature of the Group’s activities. Since the
beginning of 2017, the Group’s management has further aligned its internal reporting structure to its strategic
allowing improved monitoring of the Group’s two operating units in France (Light Vehicles and Trucks) and its
international operations in the rest of Western Europe.

The chief operating decision maker of the Group monitors profitability by revenue and adjusted EBITDA, a
non-GAAP measure which is further defined in the section “Use of adjusted EBITDA” of this note, and by the
following operating segments:

   - The Light Vehicles (“LV”) France reportable segment, including headquarter costs attributable to the
LV France segment.

   - The Trucks reportable segment, including headquarters costs attributable to the Trucks segment.

   - The LV International reportable segment, which includes the following entities:

(i) Belgian Doyen Group

(ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies since May 2017

The Group’s operations in Poland, sold in August 2017, have not been included in this segment.

The central purchasing unit (“CPU”) negotiates purchasing conditions for LV France, Trucks and LV
International, which are then sold to wholly owned distributors and to affiliated independent distributors. As part
of the new segmentation, the CPU’s income statement is now broken down between the three segments. This
breakdown is primarily based on the detailed supplier analysis. The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the
supplier level and each supplier was identified as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing
truck parts only, providing LV International parts only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV
France, Truck and LV International parts, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were further split based on the pro-rata
value of the mix of products purchased.

In addition to the three segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose
activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are
directly attributable to one of these segments. Costs that cannot be attributed to one of the segments are presented
in the “Headquarters” column. The criteria for the calculation of slow moving inventory of the Group were
modified in 2016. This resulted in a one-off reversal (non-cash) of depreciation of €1.3 million at Group level
that were fully allocated to the “Headquarters” for the year ended 31 December 2016.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is monitored at the level of the cash-generating units (CGUs)
represented by the LV France segment, and Trucks segment, in which the Group conducts its business through its
integrated networks, and for LV International, by countries in which the Group conducts its business (see
Note 9.1).

In order to provide investors with relevant and comparable financial information, revised comparative
segment information for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 is presented below based on the new
segmentation.

Polska (Poland activity) disposal, as mentioned in Notes 4 and 5.1.1.4.

**6.3 Use of adjusted EBITDA**

In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, the Group considers a variety of performance and
financial measures. The key measure used for determining how the Group’s business is performing is Adjusted
EBITDA. Management internally assesses the performance and cash flows on a consolidated basis of each
operating segment on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses and adjusted for certain items that the Group believes are non-related to ordinary activities
or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of the business, namely start-up costs related to new
businesses, income and expenses attributable to the implementation of the group transformation plan and the
sponsor fees paid to the shareholders and exceptional one-off expense related to professional conferences.

1) Start-up costs related to the customer website include costs associated with launching of the
_IDGARAGES.com website, which is still in its exploratory phase and generates only marginal revenue;_

2) Non-recurring costs related to the implementation of the group transformation plan include legal fees,
restructuring costs, or advisory costs related to the financial and capital transformation of the Group;

3) The sponsor fees paid to shareholders, including management long term incentives, if applicable, but
excluding social charges;

4) Exceptional expenses related to professional conferences: In fiscal year 2017, expenses of €0.6m were
incurred in connection with two trade fairs that take place only every two years. In Adjusted EBITDA, these
expenses will be spread over 2017 and 2018.

**7 Operating performance**

Recurring operating income comprises of revenue, cost of goods sold, personnel costs, external expenses,
taxes other than on income, other operating income and expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. It
also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of services rendered
during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange gains and losses relating to
recurring operating activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

Cost of goods for sale includes purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories and net additions
to inventories depreciation.

Other income and expenses from operations relate to unusual and material events. Other income from
operations can include gains on the disposal of operations and on the disposal of property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets. Other expenses from operations can include losses on the disposal of operations and on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as any cost relating to past disposals, the
costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**7.1 Revenue**

Revenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good
or service to the customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset.

**Sales revenue**

The Group operates a distribution of spare parts for light vehicles and trucks. Revenue is recognized when
control of the products has transferred. Revenue from sales is recognized based on the price specified in the
contract, including variable considerations if any.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**7 Operating performance (Continued)**

A receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is
unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

**Direct flow sales commission**

The Group also operates sales of spare parts, equipment and tools delivered directly by suppliers to
independent distributors that do not pass through the Group’s logistics platforms. When such third-party
suppliers other than the Group are involved in providing goods to a customer, the Group assesses whether the
nature of its promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods itself or to
arrange for the suppliers to provide those goods or services. The Group is considered an agent if its performance
obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods by the suppliers and revenue is recognized for the amount of
any commission to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the suppliers to provide
their goods. The commission earned is net of consideration that the Group retains after paying the suppliers the
consideration received in exchange for the goods to be provided by that supplier.

The Group has recognized the following amounts relating to revenue in the consolidated income statement

Polska (Poland activity) disposal, as mentioned in Notes 4 and 5.1.1.4.

**7.3 Inventories**

Inventories consist primarily of goods purchased from the third-party suppliers and are typically not further
modified or transformed by the Group. Inventories are valued at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell taking into
account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks related to slow-moving items.

Cost is calculated using the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the reporting period. The cost
of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and allowances, discounts granted by suppliers, as
well as the transportation cost of purchases. Given the fast inventory turnover rate, this method of inventory
costing is deemed to be a good approximation of first-in, first-out valuation methodology.

**Significant judgements and estimates**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold products
based on the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

**7.4 Trade receivables**

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such as a
probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group will not be able to
recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is
reduced using an allowance account. The impaired outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed
non-recoverable.

**7 Operating performance (Continued)**

The Group has multiple factoring arrangements with financial institutions.

The Group has entered into a factoring agreement with CGA and Eurofactor for its customer receivables but
the agreement with Eurofactor was revoked during 2016. As of 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Group
had sold receivables amounting to €18.0 million, €12.3 million, and €46.9 million, respectively.

Doyen group entered into factoring agreements with KBC, Caisse d’Epargne and BNP to factor receivables
for the amount of €21.2 million and €28.8 million as of 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Under all these factoring arrangements, the Group retains late payment and credit risk and therefore, the
Group continues to recognize the transferred receivables in their entirety in its balance sheet. The amount
repayable under the factoring agreement is presented as secured borrowing and is not offset against the
receivables, in accordance with IAS 39. As of 31 December 2017, the Group had a total available credit line of
€101.0 million under these arrangements, of which €20.5 million was drawn down.

In 2017, the Group entered into a new factoring agreement with Factofrance and transferred its receivable
for the amount of €60.1 million as of 31 December 2017. The full amount of transferred receivables has been
derecognized as the Group does no longer retain the risks and rewards concurrent to the ownership of these
receivables.

At 31 December 2017, the analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired was as follows:

**8 Employee costs and benefits**

The Group’s employees benefit from the following plans:

   - Defined contribution plans: The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the
return on these investments. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as
an expense.

   - Defined benefit plans: In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement
benefits. These plans are largely unfunded. Actuarial gains and losses from valuation of these plans are
recognized immediately in equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

**Significant judgements and estimates**

An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under the defined benefit plans annually using
the projected unit credit method. These calculations include demographic actuarial assumptions concerning
mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections. Probable future benefits are discounted
using a discount rate with reference to the yield on investment-grade bonds.

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These valuations are
based on assumptions such as the discount, salary increase, staff turnover and mortality rates. Due to the
long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty around these estimates.

**8 Employee costs and benefits (Continued)**

For mortality rates, tables TGH 05 and TGF 05 have been used, which take into account both gender and
age factors. The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds, such as the 10-year Euro corporates bonds for AA-grade companies. The valuation assumptions used in
the calculations for the periods presented are as follows:

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment**

**9.1 Goodwill**

In business combinations, goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and,
where appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s identifiable assets
and liabilities. Goodwill is tested where there are indications of impairment and at least once a year in order to
determine whether the carrying amount is less than the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference.

For the purpose of the impairment test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities of a cashgenerating unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs. A CGU is a homogeneous group of assets whose continued use
generates cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

**Significant judgements and estimates**

The impairment test consists of measuring the CGU’s recoverable amount and comparing it to its carrying
amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The
value in use of a CGU is determined as the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from said

assets based on the economic conditions and the operating assumptions made by the Group management. An

In 2016, the goodwill was allocated and tested following the previous segments:

   - the group of CGUs formed by the AD purchasing unit, Logisteo, Digital Aftermarket and the Doyen
group;

   - the group of CGUs formed by Cora and its subsidiaries;

   - the group of CGUs formed by ACR group;

   - the group of CGUs formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to light vehicles;

   - the group of CGUs formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to trucks, including Bremstar; and

   - the group of CGUs formed by AD Polska and its subsidiary.

The assessment of the recoverable amount for the years ended 2016 and 2015 was as follows in accordance
with the previous segments:

**_Central Purchasing Unit_**

At 31 December 2016, the assets tested were valued at €174.0 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use (i.e., €495.2 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a
discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €445.7 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%.
Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2015, the assets tested were valued at €94.1 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use (i.e., €407.1 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate
of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €366.4 million in the event that objectives in the business plan (BP) were achieved at 90%.
Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

**_Cora_**

At 31 December 2016, the assets tested were valued at €22.4 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use (i.e., €106.4 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate
of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €95.8 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this
is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2015, the assets tested were valued at €20.9 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use (i.e., €94.8 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate
of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €85.4 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this
is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

**_ACR_**

At 31 December 2016, the assets tested were valued at €55.8 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use (i.e., €90.8 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate
of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €81.7 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this
is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2015, ACR was considered a part of the Central Purchasing Unit CGU and therefore, was
tested with the assets of the Central Purchasing Unit CGU.

**_Light Vehicles_**

At 31 December 2016, the assets tested were valued at €124.5 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use (i.e., €252.0 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a
discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €226.8 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%.
Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2015, the assets tested were valued at €142.1 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use (i.e., €212.4 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a
discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €191.2 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%.
Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

**_Heavy Vehicles (including Bremstar)_**

At 30 June 2016, the Group decided to perform an impairment test on the goodwill allocated to the Heavy
Vehicles CGU, which led to the recognition of an impairment loss of €2.1 million.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

At 31 December 2016, the assets, including Bremstar, tested were valued at €37.0 million. This amount was
compared with their value in use (i.e., €31.7 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows
using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed
that the valuation would amount to €30.1 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved
at 95%, i.e., below the carrying amount of the net assets tested. However, since property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets represent just €5.8 million of the assets tested, and in view of the performance plans rolled
out by the Group, no additional asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2015, the assets for Heavy Vehicles CGU, excluding Bremstar, tested were valued at
€19.8 million. This amount was compared with their value in use (i.e., €9.2 million), calculated based on the
present value of future cash flows using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
test was performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €9.0 million in the event that objectives in
the business plan were achieved at 95%, i.e., below the carrying amount of the net assets tested. However, since
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets represent just €3.3 million of the assets tested, and in view of
the performance plans rolled out by the Group, no additional asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2015, Bremstar was considered a separate CGU from Heavy Vehicles CGU. At
31 December 2015, assets for Bremster CGU tested were valued at €16.0 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €29.2 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a
discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €26.3 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%.
Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

**_Poland_**

At 31 December 2016, the assets tested were valued at €12.6 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use (i.e., €21.5 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €18.0 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this
is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2015, the assets tested were valued at €14.9 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use (i.e., €21.9 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate
of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €18.4 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this
is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

In 2017, the Group’s segments were reviewed and updated to reflect the changes to the internal reporting
structure (see Note 6). The reorganization of its reporting structure changed the composition of the CGUs to
which goodwill has been historically allocated and therefore, goodwill was reallocated in 2017 among the CGUs.

The LV France segment and the Trucks segment also each represents the lowest level within the Group at
which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is each considered a CGU as represented by
the fact that the synergies from acquisitions in these segments benefit the business of the whole segment due to
the vertically integrated distribution model of the Group (i.e., purchasing units, logistic units and distribution
units). As described in Note 6.3, synergies generated by the acquisitions are monitored through the Adjusted
EBITDA key performance indicator, which is followed by the Group’s management at the segment level.

As a result, in 2017, goodwill was allocated and tested based on the following groups of CGUs:

   - LV France CGU;

   - Trucks CGU;

   - Doyen group CGU (part of the LV International segment); and

   - Italian subsidiaries CGU (part of the LV International segment).

Goodwill has been specifically attributed to the new CGUs based on the nature of the business covered by
the operating segments. For the CPU CGU at 31 December 2016, the attribution was made based on the
following:

1) At 31 December 2016, the amount of goodwill related to Doyen group, acquired in September 2016,
was still preliminary in accordance with IFRS. At the time of reorganisation of the Group and of its
operating segments, goodwill related to the Doyen group was therefore clearly identifiable. As a result,
this goodwill was attributed to the new Doyen group CGU.

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

2) The remaining goodwill in the CPU CGU after attribution to Doyen group CGU was then allocated on
a relative profitability value basis. As a result, the remaining goodwill was fully allocated to the new
LV France CGU.

Reconciliation of goodwill between historical CGUs and the four new CGUs is as follows:

losses in the period.

_Assessment of the recoverable amount_

**_LV France_**

At 31 December 2017, the assets tested were valued at €292.4 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use (i.e., €830.8 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a
discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1.0%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that
the valuation would amount to €747.8 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at
90%. No sensitivity test was performed on the perpetuity growth rate assumption given the significant headroom
in the result of the impairment test. Since the value in use is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets
tested, no asset impairment was recognized.

**_Trucks_**

At 31 December 2017, goodwill in the Trucks CGU consists solely of goodwill related to the acquisition of
Bisensang Group in March 2017. At 31 December 2017, the assets tested were valued at €44.1 million. This
amount was compared with their value in use (i.e., €45.0 million), calculated based on the present value of future
cash flows using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1.0%. A sensitivity test was performed

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

which showed that the valuation would amount to €40.5 million in the event that objectives in the business plan
were achieved at 90%. No asset impairment was recognized.

**_Doyen Group_**

At 31 December 2017, the assets tested were valued at €120.8 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use (i.e., €191.7 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a
discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1.0%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that
the valuation would amount to €172.5 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at
90%. No sensitivity test was performed on the perpetuity growth rate assumption given the significant headroom
in the result of the impairment test. Since the value in use is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets
tested, no asset impairment was recognized.

**_Italian subsidiaries_**

Autodis Italia, and its subsidiaries were acquired on 10 May 2017, at which date a fair value purchase price
was determined and the provisional goodwill of €22.4 million was recorded as a result of the fair value purchase
price allocation. Refer to note 5.1.1.2 for further details on the fair value purchase price allocation. Given the
assets were recognized at fair value at the time of acquisition in May 2017 and given there has been no
significant event that indicate a potential impairment, separate valuation was not performed as of 31 December
2017 and no asset impairment was recognized.

**9.2 Other intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost. Intangible assets acquired in connection
with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Costs relating to intangible assets
created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.

**Intangible assets with a finite useful life**

Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives for accounting purposes and
are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Amortization of intangible

F-69


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on
the intangible asset’s function. The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise
Movex accounting software licenses. These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following
estimated useful life:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

**Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life**

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a
year on 31 December, either individually or at the level of the CGU to which they belong, and whenever there is
an indication that they may be impaired.

**Impairment**

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated amortization
and impairment. The assets are tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its net carrying
amount, where the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in
use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent on
the cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in
the income statement in the appropriate expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously identified indication
of impairment has decreased or no longer exists. In this case, the Group estimates the recoverable amount and an
impairment loss previously recorded is reversed to the asset’s recoverable amount. When an impairment loss is
reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,
less depreciation and amortization, had no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An
impairment loss reversal is recorded in the income statement.

**Significant judgements and estimates**

The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a
year at the reporting date. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually
at the reporting date in order to determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment is still justified. If it is
not, the change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

For the purpose of impairment testing, value in use is determined using the projected future cash flows
based on the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee, discounted by applying a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An
appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less costs to sell.

**_Autodistribution brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand recognized at the time of the acquisition of Autodis on 28 February 2006 by
Parts Holding Europe (formerly Autodis Group) is allocated to the LV France and Trucks CGUs. The net
carrying value of the brand is amounted to €156.9 million, €156.9 million and €144.0 million as of
31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

On 31 December 2016, the Group carried out a valuation of the Autodistribution brand using the revenue
approach (royalty method). This method is based on revenue generated over the projected five years by the
Autodistribution brand, including the Group’s subsidiaries and affiliated distributors. The assumptions used
include a discount rate of 10.5%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. This valuation
showed a brand value of €169 million, compared to the net carrying value of €144.0 million. Under IAS 38,
reversal of impairment is limited to the previously recorded impairment amount and therefore, a reversal of the
previously recorded impairment of €12.9 million was recorded at 31 December 2016, increasing the carrying
value to €156.9 million.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

On 31 December 2017, the Group carried out a valuation of the Autodistribution brand using the same
approach as 2016. The assumptions used include a discount rate of 10.5%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a perpetuity
growth rate of 1.0%. This valuation showed a brand value of €175.3 million. Although this is higher than the
carrying amount of €156.9 million, there is no additional impairment previously recorded that can be reversed
and therefore, the Autodistribution brand continues to be carried at its current carrying value. The table below
shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the discount rate and royalty rate assumptions:

**_Mondial Pare-Brise brand_**

The “Mondial Pare-Brise” brand recognized at the time of the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise on
22 March 2017 by the Group is allocated to the LV France CGU. The net carrying value of the brand is amounted
to €13.8 million as of 31 December 2017. Given the brand was recognized at fair value at the time of acquisition
in March 2017, separate valuation was not performed as of 31 December 2017. Refer to Note 5.1.1.1 for details
of assumptions used to value the brand.

**_Autodistribution Belux customer relationship_**

On 19 April 2017, Doyen group, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired ADB, subsequently
renamed Autodistribution Belux (Belgium-Luxembourg), from Parts Point Group for €10.0 million with an
earn-out clause of maximum €4.0 million. This acquisition became effective 29 April 2017. Assessment was
performed under IFRS 3 and it was determined the transaction is not a business acquisition but in essence an
acquisition of a large customer portfolio in Belgium and Luxembourg for distribution of vehicles mechanics and
equipment spare parts market. Given the customer relationship was recognized at fair value at the time of
acquisition in April 2017, separate valuation was not performed as of 31 December 2017.

**9.3 Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures, are carried
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Routine maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following useful
lives:

Properties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized when it is disposed of or when no further future
economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from derecognizing an asset (calculated
on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on disposal and the net carrying amount) is recorded in
the income statement in the year in which it is derecognized.

**11 Provisions**

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implied) arising as a result of a
past event, when it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be necessary in
order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. In the ordinary course of
its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating to industrial disputes, commercial
disputes, etc. In such cases, in conjunction with its legal advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the
disputes and assesses the probability that an outflow of resources will be required to settle them.

When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an insurance
policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The amount of the expense
corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of any refunds.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a current rate
before tax, which reflects the risks specific to the liability. When the provision is discounted, the increase relating
to the passage of time is recorded as a financial expense.

Changes in current provisions are as follows:

(1) The reversal of the provision for site closures at Logisteo amounts to €1.6 million, less a discounting adjustment to reflect the passage of
time of €0.1 million.

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automotive spare parts in France, sued
Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de Commerce) for the
sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is for approximately €2.4 million. No
provision was booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2017. The Commercial
Court handed down a judgment on 23 March 2017 that exonerated Gadest and Autodistribution, and retained the
potential liability of three other subsidiaries, adding that the €0.3 million in compensation is secured by Klarius’
English parent companies in collective proceedings. This judgement is not enforceable. In this context, Group
confirms its historical position and consider that the probability of an outflow of resources has not been
demonstrated, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the lawsuit.

**12 Financial assets and liabilities**

Financial assets

Financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value
through income, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables, or available-for-sale financial assets, as
appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, when
permitted and appropriate, it reviews the classification on each annual reporting date.

_Financial assets at fair value through income_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income includes financial assets acquired with a view
to resale in the near term. Designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category. At
31 December 2017, investment securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are valued at amortized cost using the
effective interest rate method less any impairment. Amortized cost is calculated taking into account any initial
premium or discount and includes fees that form an integral part of the effective interest rate as well as
transaction costs.

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
If there are objective indications of an impairment loss on loans and receivables recorded at amortized cost, the
amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of
estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the
effective interest rate calculated on the initial recognition date. The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by using
an impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the income statement.

**12 Financial assets and liabilities (Continued)**

_Available-for-sales assets_

Available-for-sales financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2017) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any of the
preceding categories. After initial recognition, available-for-sales financial assets are measured at fair value and
any related gains and losses are recorded directly in equity in a reserve for net unrealized gains and losses. On
disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accrued profit or loss previously recorded in equity is recorded in the
income statement.

The interest received or paid on said investments is recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of
the effective interest rate. Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as
“Dividends received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost, net of the repayment of the
principal and amortization, and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recorded in the income
statement, is transferred from equity to income. Impairment losses taken against equity instruments cannot be
reversed through the income statement. Impairment losses relating to debt instruments are reversed through the
income statement if the increase in the instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred
after the impairment loss had been recorded in the income statement.

Financial liabilities

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are recognized over the term of the
loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortized issue costs are presented as a deduction from the
liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized through the
amortized cost mechanism.

Fair value

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as effective for as of 1 July 2014, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

Level 1: prices on the valuation date for identical instruments to those being valued, quoted on an active
market to which the entity has access;

Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from extrapolations). This
level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is obliged to rely on its own assumptions
to assess the data that other market participants would have applied to price other instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents are measured at level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

_12.1.2 Group financing as of 31 December, 2016_

On 28 September 2016, Parts Holding Europe acquired Doyen group through an €80 million bridge loan.
Subsequently, based on a further review of the bond market, on 14 November 2016, the Group refinanced its
long-term debt with the issuance of Senior Secured Notes for a total amount of €520 million, broken down as
follows:

 - €260.0 million in Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes paying variable interest at Euribor +4.375%, maturing
in 2022, and

 - €260.0 million in Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes paying fixed interest at 4.375%, maturing in 2022.

The new facility was used to pay down existing debt of €270 million and the €80 million bridge loan used to
fund the acquisition of Doyen group, as well as to redeem a portion of the debt for the amount of €140 million
issued to Dakar Finance SA via a capital decrease. This transaction incurred an expense of €11.2 million, which
is included in the value of the loan on the Group’s financial statements and is amortized over the term of the
bond.

shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares. The Group does not have any equity-based
covenants.

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under finance
leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The financial instruments are
contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The Group has other financial assets such as
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, which are generated directly by its
operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange
risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing these risks are summarized below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimize debt to equity ratios and the financial leverage
obtained by debt.

_12.6.1 Interest rate risk_

The Group borrows at fixed and variable rates, and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk on the portion of
debt corresponding to the €340.0 million Senior Secured Notes paying interest at Euribor +4.375%.

An increase in the 3-month Euribor rate would have the following impacts on the interest costs related to the
Senior Secured Floating Notes:

_12.6.2 Foreign exchange risk_

Following the disposal of the Poland business, as explained in Note 5.1.1.4, the Group does not have any
subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than euro.

_12.6.3 Counterparty risk_

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain payment
credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce its credit
default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment history, past or present
financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure relates to
potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure equals the carrying amount of these
instruments.

_12.6.4 Liquidity risk_

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing through
the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

_12.6.5 Capital management_

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a good credit
risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise value for shareholders

**13 Income tax**

The Group opted for tax consolidation in France. This option concerns all the Group’s French companies
with the exception of non-material subsidiaries.

**13 Income tax (Continued)**

_Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are valued at the
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws applied to
determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the
income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution Economique
_Territoriale – CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée_
_des Entreprises – CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods for determining said contribution with regard to_
the provisions adopted by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the
French national accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité – CNC) and it concluded that this
contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been
classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

**13.2 Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences existing at the
reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the statement of
financial position.

F-88


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**13 Income tax (Continued)**

Deferred tax liabilities are recorded for any taxable timing differences while deferred tax assets are recorded
for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is
probable that a taxable profit will be available against which they may be offset. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year in which the asset is realized or the
liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules) enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred taxes related to items recognized directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the income
statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and when they
relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority.

Significant judgements and estimates

The calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate
how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of tax
management strategies. Recognized deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s six-year
business plan for the year ended 31 December 2017 and of five-year business plan for the years ended
31 December 2016 and 2015.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it no longer
appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some or all of said deferred tax
assets can be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized if it
becomes likely that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (which allows offset of income from companies
in a previous tax group against losses in the new tax group in which they belong) for companies Autodis
consolidates for tax purposes. This tax consolidation group’s tax loss carry-forwards were offset against the
taxable income of the profitable companies in an expanded base in 2017. There is also a French tax consolidation
group whose parent company is Parts Holding Europe and which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and
the companies in the expanded tax base (previously consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes).

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the French tax consolidation group generated a tax benefits of €0.4 million,
€0.2 million and €10.9 million, respectively.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**13 Income tax (Continued)**

According to French Finance Act of 2013, effective as of 31 December 2012, loss carry-forward is limited
to €1.0 million plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount. Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of
the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the tax loss carry-forwards. The result obtained is then included in the
Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also
applies.

A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the six-year business plan
(i.e one additional year vs. 2016) for France to determine the future utilization of tax loss carry-forwards in light
of existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognized in the financial statements at
31 December 2017. The impact of including one additional year of business plan in the tax planning exercise
compared to the fiscal year 2016 is an increase of €9.3 million in deferred tax assets.

This exercise shows that €237.7 million in tax loss carry-forwards would be utilized, i.e., a tax saving of
€68.2 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of the business
plan, the deferred tax asset recognized in the financial statements was limited to this amount.

At 31 December 2017, tax loss carry-forwards, after utilizing €27.9 million in 2017, stood at €147.1 million
for the expanded base and €284.8 million for the Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group in France.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse in the long
term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2018 budget and the five-year business
plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax assets after the said period, except as a
deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the reporting date. At 31 December 2017, unrecognized
tax loss carry-forwards amounts to €194.2 million.

   - “Autodistribution” (semi-figurative) in France under registration number 1554818;

   - “AD” (term and design) in France under registration number 1629231.

_Assignments of receivables_

85% of the CICE tax credit receivables for 2013 and 2014 was financed with BPI France in 2014. The sale
of the receivables did not lead to their derecognition, and they are not therefore offset against the debt with
respect to BPI France. During 2017, the Group received the 2013 CICE tax credit and repaid BPI France the full
amount of financing related to the 2013 CICE tax credit receivables.

_Bank covenants_

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes a covenant on the amount that may be financed.
Financing added to the Senior Secured Notes divided by consolidated pro forma EBITDA may not exceed a ratio
of 0.7:1. This covenant must be tested each quarter whenever drawdowns on the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement are equal to or greater than 35%.

The Doyen group must issue consolidated financial statements with minimum €20 million in adjusted
shareholders’ equity.

_16.2.2 Other Group guarantees_

The guarantees below were given by Autodistribution SA to FPLS group banks:

   - Banque Populaire de l’Ouest: €1.2 million in respect of overdrafts plus €0.5 million in respect of the
discount line.

   - LCL: €0.4 million in respect of loans.

The Doyen financing guarantees are described below:

   - Doyen Auto France factoring agreement: Doyen Auto guarantee granted to BNP on behalf of Doyen Auto
France.

  - Doyen Auto France: restricted current account between Doyen Auto and Doyen Auto France for
€4.0 million (plus a €4.0 million surety from Doyen Auto), at the request of Société Générale and Crédit Du
Nord banks.

   - Doyen Auto and Doyen Auto Belgium: Club agreement with BNP Fortis, ING and KBC for €12.5 million:
pledge of business assets and Doyen Auto Belgium factoring.

   - Ariane: subrogation agreement granted by Doyen Auto in favour of KBC France

An agreement was also signed with the supplier Akzo Nobel in June 2012 in which Autodistribution
commits to minimum cumulative purchases of €55.0 million up to 2019. At 31 December 2017, cumulative
purchases amounted to €53.3 million. The increase in purchases is attributable to the car paint platform.

**16 Commitments (Continued)**

**16.3 Personal training account**

The personal training account is managed by a third party through Caisse des dépôts et consignations. The
related contributions—amounting to 0.2% of payroll—are paid over to Caisse des dépôts et consignations via
two training organizations (OPCA and OPACIF). All of the Group’s entities are subject to the rules governing
the personal training account.

**17 Transactions with related parties**

**Relationship with the shareholder**

The sole shareholder of Parts Holding Europe SAS is Dakar Acquisition SA, a subsidiary of Bain Capital. In
2017 and 2016, the Group paid management fees, including the sponsor fees, to Dakar Acquisition SA in the
amount of €2.3 million and €1.9 million, respectively.

**Relations with equity-accounted companies**

Neoparts is an independent distributor with contractual relationships with the Autodistribution purchasing
unit for automotive spare parts.

AD International is a company governed by Belgian law that negotiates preferential tariffs with suppliers for
all members of the AD network. Each year, the Group receives end-of-year rebates depending on the volumes it
has purchased.

Parts Holdings Italy was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group until the Group sold 80% of the shares to
Giadi in 2013.

The Group did not have any significant intercompany transactions with these investees in the years ended
31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015. There are no restrictions on the transfer of funds with these entities or any
unrecognized share of losses, in accordance with the equity method.

**Relationship with Parts Holding Europe managers**

At the time of the acquisition of Parts Holding Europe, the new main shareholder, Bain Capital, entered into
an arrangement with certain managers of the Group. Parts Holding Europe managers subscribed to shares in
Dakar Holding at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.

The Parts Holding Europe managers further agreed to sell back to Bain Capital the shares and preferred
equity certificates (“PECs”) in Dakar Holding in the event they leave the Group before a certain service period.
The selling price of the shares and PECs is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the
service period and the nature of the departure (voluntary or dismissal).

In the Group’s consolidated financial statements, this arrangement was classified within equity, as the
Group did not have any obligation to settle the transaction with the Parts Holding Europe managers. In addition,
since the investment by the Parts Holding Europe managers was measured at fair value, no expense was
recognized in income for the year.

**17.1 Management compensation**

The key management personnel of a group are those persons having authority and responsibility for
planning, managing and supervising the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director
(executive or otherwise) of that entity.

The Group’s key management personnel are the members of the Executive Committee, directors, area
managers and brand general managers.
