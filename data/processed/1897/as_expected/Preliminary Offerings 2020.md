Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)
(“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside
the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) in connection
with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated
(all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only
at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to Relevant
Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in

sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the initial purchasers, or any person who controls any initial purchaser, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of

**Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’**
product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities described in the Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt securities is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors and UK Retail Investors: The debt securities described in**
the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the
United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97, as amended or superseded, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore, offering or selling such debt
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JULY 7, 2020**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

## PARTS EUROPE S.A.
### €300,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2025
Parts Europe S.A. (formerly Autodis S.A.), a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of France (the “Issuer”), is offering
(the “Offering”) €300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”).
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of % and will mature on, 2025. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semiannually in arrears on and, commencing on, 2021. Prior to January, 2022, the Issuer will be entitled, at its
option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a “make-whole” premium. In addition, prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may
redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) with the net cash
proceeds from certain equity offerings. Prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price
equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof. On or after January, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the
redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”).
Additionally, upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control or upon certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to
make an offer to purchase the Notes. A change of control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net
leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to
redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes.
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt
that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), the PGE Loan (as
defined herein), the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (as defined herein) and future hedging obligations (if any). The Notes will be
guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by Parts Holding Europe S.A.S. (formerly Autodis Group S.A.S.), a société par
_actions simplifiée organized and existing under the laws of France, the direct parent company of the Issuer (the “Parent Guarantor”), and_
Autodistribution S.A.S., a société par actions simplifiée organized and existing under the laws of France, a direct subsidiary of the Issuer (the
“Subsidiary Guarantor” and together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantees rank senior in right of payment to the
respective Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee and rank pari passu in right of
payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.
The Notes will be secured by (i) a first-priority pledge of the share capital of Dakar Acquisition S.A., the indirect parent company of the
Issuer (“LuxCo 6”); (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, material bank accounts and material intragroup receivables of the Parent
Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings); (iv) a first-priority
security interests over certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A.S., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM
S.A. held by the Issuer, its material bank accounts and its material intragroup receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital
stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A.S.,
(B) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material bank accounts and (C) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material intragroup receivables (the “Collateral”). The
Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and future hedging obligations (if any) (the “Super Senior Obligations”) are also secured by firstpriority security interests over, among other things, the Collateral. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the
event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the
Super Senior Obligations have been repaid. The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and
ranking of the Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” The Notes will_
be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and effectively subordinated to any
existing and future debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including the Super Senior Obligations, that is secured by property or assets that do
not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets. The Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan are guaranteed
by, and are secured by certain assets of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee or provide security in favor of the Notes.
The Notes will be represented on issuance by one or more Global Notes (as defined herein), which we expect will be delivered in bookentry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) on or about,
2020 (the “Issue Date”). Interests in each Global Note will be exchangeable for definitive Notes only in certain limited circumstances. See
“Book-entry, delivery and form.”
Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to
deal in the Notes on the Official List (the “Official List”) of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance,
however, that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that
such listing will be maintained.
**INVESTING IN THE NOTES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. SEE “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE 30**
**FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISKS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE INVESTING IN THE NOTES.**


**Issue price of the Notes:** **%, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date.**

**The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the**
**“U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes and the Guarantees are being offered and sold in the**
**United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and outside**
**the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers that are qualified**

that the seller of any Note may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S.
Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.

**Notice to European Economic Area investors**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for
offers of the Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended and
superseded).

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do
so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such
offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes
through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final
placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Prohibition of Offers to EEA and UK Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold to and should not be offered, sold to any retail investor in the
EEA or in the UK. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, as amended or superseded, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as
defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of this section, the expression “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in any
Member State means the communication in any form and by any means presenting sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for
the Notes.

**_Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of the
product approval process of the manufacturers’, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to
our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Notice to investors in Luxembourg**

The Notes are not offered or sold, directly or indirectly, to the public in or from Luxembourg and each
Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it will not offer or sell the Notes or cause the Offering of the
Notes or contribute to the Offering of the Notes to the public in or from Luxembourg, unless all the relevant legal
and regulatory requirements concerning a public offer in or from Luxembourg have been complied with. In
particular, this offer of the Notes has not been and may not be announced to the public and this Offering
Memorandum nor any other offering or marketing materials may not be made available to the public in
Luxembourg.

**Notice to investors in France**

This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared and is not being distributed in the context of a public
offer of financial securities (offre au public de titres financiers) in France within the meaning of Article L.411-1
of the French Code monétaire et financier other than those referred to in Article L.411-2 of the French Code

iv


-----

_monétaire et financier and, therefore, neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering or marketing_
materials relating to the Notes has been approved by, registered or filed with the French financial markets
authority, or “AMF.” Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the public in
France, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering or marketing materials relating to the
Notes may be made available or distributed, or used in connection with any offer for subscription or sales of the
Notes, in each case, in any way that would constitute, directly or indirectly, an offer to the public in France.

The Notes shall only be offered or sold in France pursuant to Article L. 411-2 1° of the French Code
_monétaire et financier to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifiés), as defined in and in accordance with_
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). No offer or sale, directly or
indirectly, of the Notes in France, other than in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and in particular
those relating to a public offering (which are, in particular, embodied in Articles L.411-1, L.411-2, L.412-1 and
L.621-8 to L.621-8-3 of the French Code monétaire et financier) shall be made.

**Notice to investors in the United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion

connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). This Offering Memorandum
is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant
Persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is permitted only by
Relevant Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

**Forward-looking statements**

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations
and projections about future events. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this
Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial position, risks
and uncertainties related to our business, strategy, capital expenditures, projected costs and our plans and
objectives for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk” and similar
expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance.

In addition, any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and
we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this
Offering Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this
Offering Memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results
include:

   - the impact of material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network and increases in
transportation costs;

   - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;

   - the ability of third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements;

   - the impact of French, Benelux, Italian and worldwide economic and other conditions on demand for
our products;

   - the risk that our growth strategy may not be successful;

v


-----

   - our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our network;

   - the risk that our customers’ financial difficulties require us to write off debts;

   - the impact of competition in the spare parts distribution industry;

   - our reliance on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks and the length of service
intervals;

   - failure to successfully anticipate demand or manage our inventory and services;

   - disruption of our information technology (“IT”) systems;

   - failure or interruption in software or information systems licensed from third parties;

   - the increasing use of technology in our industry;

   - failure to maintain or improve our brand image;

   - an ineffective marketing and communication strategy;

   - failure by our suppliers to comply with ethical business practices or applicable laws and regulations;

   - coverage of our liabilities by insurance;

   - the impact of our lease obligations on our operating flexibility;

   - theft in our warehouses and other facilities;

   - the impact of price and margin pressures;

   - the termination of our affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors;

   - lower sales from, or a deterioration of our relationship with, our distributors and branded garages;

   - our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

   - the impact of changes in laws and regulations, including in relation to labor, employment and tax and
our inability to use French tax loss carry-forwards;

   - the deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions;

   - the impact of higher employment costs;

   - the impact of environmental, health and safety regulations;

   - the risk associated with fluctuations in our working capital requirements;

   - material losses as a result of product liability and warranty claims;

   - reliance on certain certifications for the operation of our Trucks segment;

   - the risk associated with product liability claims on products we import in the European Union;

   - the impact of legal and arbitration proceedings;

   - our failure to comply with tax regulations and actions by tax authorities and increase of VAT rates;

   - the impact of changes in accounting standards;

   - the impact of competition and antitrust laws; and

   - other risks associated with our financing, the Notes and our structure discussed under “Risk Factors.”

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations
in “Summary,” “Risk factors” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
_operations.” Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect_
our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly
changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such
risk factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results.

**Industry and market data**

This Offering Memorandum contains market and competitive position data from industry publications and
from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources believed to be reliable by management. These thirdparty sources include surveys or studies commissioned by us and INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et
_des Etudes Economiques)._

We believe that these industry publications, surveys and studies are reliable. We cannot, however, assure
you of the accuracy and completeness of such information, and we have not independently verified such industry
and market data. Industry and consultant publications and forecasts generally state that the information they
contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed. While we believe that each of the studies and publications we have used is
reliable, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the data that were extracted or derived
from these industry and consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness.
Market data and statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions.
Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both
the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be
included in the relevant market.

While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such
data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed
under “Risk factors.” As far as we are aware and have been able to ascertain from information published by such
third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, we have made statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding our industry and our position
in the industry based on our experience and our own investigation of market conditions. Market share figures
presented herein are based on revenue and exclude tires, oil, accessories and consumables. Market share figures
of the Group provided herein are based on total network sales, which is calculated as our revenue plus estimated
sales of our independent affiliated distributors, as applicable. References to the “core” Western European light
vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket excludes tires, oil, accessories and consumables, and references to the
“core” truck spare parts distribution and repair aftermarket in France includes distribution of spare parts and
repair and maintenance services and does not include OEM parts sales, labor and workshop margins on spare
parts. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you that any of these statements are accurate or correctly
reflect our position in the industry, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any
independent sources.

**Presentation of financial information and other data**

**Financial statements presented**

We have included in this Offering Memorandum (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, with the comparative financial information as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, (ii) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent
Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, with the comparative financial information as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2018, and (iii) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020 (the “Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements”), with the comparative financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

The Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating business, operations or significant assets other
than in connection with its incorporation and the Refinancing, investments in its subsidiaries and intragroup
loans, and is not required to, and does not, prepare consolidated financial statements. Consequently, only limited
historical financial information relating to the Issuer is available, and no financial information with respect to the
Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent
Guarantor and the results of operations and financial position of the Issuer are included in the Parent Guarantor’s
consolidated financial statements. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Each of
_the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own_
_and will depend on cash from its operating subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the Notes.” Unless_
specified otherwise, all historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the
Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor guarantees the Notes on a senior secured basis.
Accordingly, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of financial information in this
Offering Memorandum are to the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

The audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor, and the comparative financial
information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, included herein have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). The unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, with comparative financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2019, included
herein have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting,” the IFRS standard
applicable to interim financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas in which
assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our audited consolidated
financial statements. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
_operations—Critical accounting policies.”_

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which has an impact on our reported
consolidated assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flow statement. The implementation of IFRS 16
resulted in an increase of €170.2 million in total assets and €171.4 million in total liabilities, in each case as of
January 1, 2019, and had a positive impact on Adjusted EBITDA of €47.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. We prepared our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, under the
modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. Accordingly, our results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, which were prepared after the first application of IFRS 16,
are limited in comparability to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, which were
prepared before the first application of IFRS 16. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Results of Operations—_
_Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.”_

In the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor for the year ended December 31, 2019, our
consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2018 was restated to give effect to a goodwill
adjustment in respect of the acquisition of Oscaro. The results of Oscaro were integrated into our consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, on the completion date of the acquisition of
Oscaro, i.e. November 13, 2018. This period of one and a half month did not allow for a complete evaluation of
Oscaro and a provisional goodwill was calculated and recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, in

viii


-----

accordance with IFRS 3 “Business combinations.” The calculation of goodwill has been updated in our
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, and as a result our balance
sheet as of December 31, 2018, has been restated to give effect to this goodwill adjustment. See notes 4.1 and 4.3
to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December
31, 2019, included in this Offering Memorandum for additional information.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering
and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own
professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and generally accepted auditing
principles in the United States and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this
Offering Memorandum.

Unless otherwise indicated, and other than for percentages and ratios, the financial information of the Parent
Guarantor for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, included in this Offering Memorandum has been
derived by adding the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019, to the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, and subtracting the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the three
months ended March 31, 2019. The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any
future period or our financial condition at any future date. This information has not been audited or reviewed by
any auditors.

The contents of any website, including the websites of Bain Capital, the Issuer or any member of the Group,
do not form any part of this Offering Memorandum.

**Pro Forma Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information of
the Parent Guarantor for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, adjusted to give full-year effect to the
acquisitions made during the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 (see note 5.1 to the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and 5.1.1 to the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor included in this Offering Memorandum) and related synergies and
cost saving measures (collectively, the “Pro Forma Financial Information”). The Pro Forma Financial
Information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual results would
have been had the aforementioned transactions occurred on April 1, 2019, nor does it purport to project our
results of operation at any future date. The Pro Forma Financial Information included in this Offering
Memorandum has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S.
Securities Act, IFRS or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting
Pro Forma Financial Information have been audited in accordance with French generally accepted accounting
standards, International Accounting Standards or U.S. generally accepted accounting standards. In evaluating the
Pro Forma Financial Information, you should carefully consider our audited historical consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Pro Forma Financial Information is based upon available information and assumptions that we believe
are reasonable but are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have actually been achieved if the
aforementioned transactions had been completed on the dates indicated, or indicative of the results that may be
achieved in the future. The Pro Forma Financial Information is provided for information purposes only.

**Segment reporting**

Throughout this Offering Memorandum, we present our financial results by segment. These segments
correspond to the Parent Guarantor’s reporting segments in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments.” Our
operating segments consist of the following:

   - _“Light Vehicle France” segment, which includes the activities of:_

(i) the central purchasing units (“CPUs”) dedicated to the supply of spare parts for Light Vehicle

for the year ended December 31, 2017, presented in this Offering Memorandum.

**Other financial measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA excluding Digital B2C, Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted
EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin, Adjusted EBITDA excluding Digital B2C margin, Adjusted EBITDA organic
growth, Revenue organic growth, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, net operating cash flow, cash conversion and
change in working capital (collectively, the “Non-IFRS measures”) (each as defined by us) that are not required
by, or presented in accordance with, SEC requirements, IFRS or the accounting standards of any other
jurisdiction. We have included these measures because management uses them to measure operating performance
in presentations to our directors and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, as well as for monitoring
certain aspects of our cash flows from operating activities and liquidity. Our Non-IFRS measures are defined by
us as follows:

   - “Adjusted capital expenditure” represents capital expenditure excluding the one-off investments made
in our new automated Logisteo platform. For a reconciliation of Adjusted capital expenditures to
capital expenditures, see footnote 4 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other
_information”;_

   - “Adjusted EBITDA” represents operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses (as included in our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017,

x


-----

2018 and 2019, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020) and (i) as adjusted for
certain non-cash items and certain items we believe are non-recurring, or otherwise not reflective of the
ongoing performance of our business, including start-up costs related to new businesses, income and
expenses attributable to the implementation of our transformation plan, fees paid to our shareholders
and exceptional one-off expenses related to professional conferences, and (ii) as further adjusted to
eliminate the impact of IFRS 16 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended
March 31, 2019 and 2020. IFRS 16 (“Leases”) became effective for periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 is presented on a
pre-IFRS 16 basis. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is a relevant measure for
assessing performance and cash flows and thus aids in understanding our profitability for a given
period. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income from ordinary activities, see
footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information”;

   - “Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16” represents operating income from ordinary activities before
depreciation and amortization expenses and (i) as adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain items
we believe are non-recurring, or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business,
including start-up costs related to new businesses, income and expenses attributable to the
implementation of our transformation plan, fees paid to our shareholders and exceptional one-off
expenses related to professional conferences, and (ii) without eliminating the impact of IFRS 16 for the
year ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. Adjusted
EBITDA—IFRS 16 is presented because we believe it is a relevant measure for assessing performance
and cash flows and thus aids in understanding our profitability for a given period. For a reconciliation
of Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 to operating income from ordinary activities, see footnote 1 under
“Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information”;

   - “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by
revenue;

   - “Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted
EBITDA—IFRS 16 divided by revenue;

   - “Adjusted EBITDA organic growth” and “Revenue organic growth” between two periods (N and N-1)
are determined as follows:

(a) in respect of acquisitions made in period N, by deducting, from the period N revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated in period N by such
acquisitions;

(b) in respect of acquisitions made in period N-1, by deducting from the period N and period N-1
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated in period
N and N-1 by such acquisitions; and

(c) in respect of disposals, by deducting, from the period N and N-1 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA,
the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated by disposed activities made in period
N and in period N-1 up to their disposal.

From time to time we acquire, sell or close individual sites or businesses as part of our ongoing network
management. These transactions are considered not material over the historical period and are deemed to be part
of organic growth;

   - “cash conversion,” expressed as a percentage, represents net operating cash flow divided by Adjusted
EBITDA;

   - “change in working capital” represents the change in inventories, trade payables, trade receivables and
other receivables and payables;

   - “net operating cash flow” represents Adjusted EBITDA, net of adjusted capital expenditure and
including the change in working capital. For a reconciliation of net operating cash flow to Adjusted
EBITDA, see footnote 5 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information—
_Other financial and pro forma data”; and_

   - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” represents Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 after giving pro forma effect
to the acquisitions made during the relevant period and the relevant synergies and cost saving
measures. For a reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to operating income from ordinary
activities, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information.”

We present Non-IFRS measures for informational purposes only. There can be no assurance that items we
have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be
incurred in the future. The calculations of the Non-IFRS measures are based on various assumptions and
management estimates. These amounts have not been and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or
verified by any independent accounting firm.

We present the Non-IFRS measures because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our
operating performance and ability to service our debt and because our management uses these measures to assess
our liquidity and operating performance. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to other
indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance
with IFRS.

Our Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Our Non-IFRS measures may not give an
accurate or complete picture of our results or transactions for the periods presented, may not be comparable to
our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum
and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. The limitations with respect to our
Non-IFRS measures include:

   - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

   - they do not reflect any cash income taxes and certain other taxes that we may be required to pay;

   - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of
cash flows;

   - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

   - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and the Non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

Other companies in our industry may calculate the Non-IFRS measures differently than we do, which may
limit their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS measures and related
ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our
business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations or reduce our indebtedness.
You should rely primarily on our IFRS results and use these Non-IFRS measures only as a supplement to
evaluate our performance.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, other EBITDA-based measures and/or
financial ratios (including ratio of pro forma net financial debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, ratio of pro
forma net senior secured debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro
forma net interest expense) may not be calculated in the same manner as comparable measures or ratios such as
“Consolidated EBITDA,” “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio,” “Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio” and “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” are calculated pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness.

**Restatements**

**_Oscaro Goodwill Adjustments_**

The results of Oscaro were integrated into our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018, on the completion date of the acquisition of Oscaro, i.e. November 13, 2018. This period of
one and a half month did not allow for a complete evaluation of Oscaro and a provisional goodwill was
calculated and recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business
combinations.” The calculation of goodwill has been updated in our consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2019, and as a result our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, has been
restated to give effect to this goodwill adjustment. See notes 4.1 and 4.3 to the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included in this Offering
Memorandum for additional information.

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary highlights selected information from this Offering Memorandum. The summary does_
_not contain all the information you should consider before you invest in the Notes and should be read in_
_conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum. See “Risk factors” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition_
_and results of operations” for additional factors that you should consider before investing in the Notes._

**Overview**

We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain, with over 55 years of experience.
Since the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline)
distributor in the business-to-business (“B2B”), business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) and
business-to-consumer (“B2C”) segments. We hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by
our unique operational model and value-added services proposition, our history of organic growth and valueaccretive acquisition-led growth as well as our strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended March 31,
2020, we generated revenue of €1,782.9 million, an Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of €197.8 million and a Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €219.9 million.

In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19
(“COVID-19”), was reported in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus has since spread, and infections have been found
in the vast majority of countries around the world, including throughout Europe. Following an increase in sales
and Adjusted EBITDA for the two months ended February 29, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, our
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA declined sharply in the second half of March 2020 and in April 2020 as a result
of the lockdown measures implemented in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in the markets in which we
operate. Notwithstanding, the IAM has showed structural resilience during this period, supported by strong
market fundamentals such as the non-discretionary nature of the services we provide combined with a low risk of
trading down from end-customers since spare parts available in the IAM are more affordable. In May 2020, when
the lockdown measures impacting our markets were progressively eased, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
recovered to a level comparable to May 2019. In June 2020, we continued to benefit from the easing of the
lockdown measures in our geographies and our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to June
2019. Financial information for any period following March 31, 2020, is based on management accounts, which
have not been audited or reviewed. See “Recent Developments,” “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our business—Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19,_
_may materially affect our business and results of operations.”_

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018. We also hold
leading positions around the rest of Western Europe and, in 2018, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM
distributor in both Belgium and Italy (21% and 4% market share, respectively), the fourth largest light vehicle
IAM distributor in the Netherlands (5% market share). We entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the
acquisition of 75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, a leading B2B distributor in Catalonia with approximately 27 sites as
of December 2019, and a member of AD Parts, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain,
with 30% market share in 2018.

We operate our business through four operational segments which address the light vehicle independent
aftermarket in France (“Light Vehicle France”), certain light vehicle independent aftermarkets in Benelux, Italy
and Spain (“Light Vehicle International”), the digital activities of Oscaro (“Digital B2C”) and the truck
independent aftermarket in France (“Trucks”). The pie charts below show the breakdown of our revenue by
segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our distribution is carried out by a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local
wholesale distributors who distribute our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages,
independent garages, retail locations and online players. Our operational model is founded on our excellent
relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms, an extensive Western European
distribution network and a broad and loyal base of customers to which we deliver a wide range of value-added
services.

**Our strengths**

**_Leader in the resilient, predictable and structurally growing Western European market_**

vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands and we entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the acquisition of
75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain. We operate in the
Western European light vehicle distribution “core” aftermarket that is structurally resilient in the face of
macroeconomic factors that impact the broader automotive industry and distribution markets. While new car
sales tend to fluctuate with economic cycles, the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket benefits from a
steadily growing installed car parc and the recurring need for maintenance and repairs to be made to the existing
car parc, irrespective of downturns in the economy. New car sales only account for a small portion of the overall
car parc. Approximately 2.6 million new cars were sold in France in 2018, compared with a car parc of
approximately 38 million cars in total. Moreover, in economic downturns customers generally favor IAM
distributors, such as us, over OE distributors due to longer car ownership, as new car sales decrease, as well as
increased price-sensitivity. For example, after a sharp decline at the end of March and beginning of April 2020,
the French light vehicle spare parts market showed resilience and a significant recovery at the beginning of May
2020, also due to a generalized decline in the use public transport as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which
favored car usage.

The IAMs in which we operate show particular strength and growth potential due to two long-term market
dynamics: a stable, slightly increasing Western European car parc and an increase in average vehicle age which
are expected to drive growth in the number of cars that need service by light vehicle IAM distributors like us in
the coming years. Between 2014 and 2018, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket
grew at a CAGR of 1.9%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc, while the Western European
light vehicle IAM grew more quickly and gained market share, at a CAGR of 2.9%. The French light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket revenues and light vehicle IAM revenues are forecast to grow by 1% and 1.6% over
the 2018 to 2025 period. The Western European light vehicle IAM is also expected to continue outperforming
both the broader market and its OE car dealer network competitors in the 2018 to 2025 period. The existing car
parc’s age and mileage increase due to growing mobility needs, including car sharing or long-term leasing, and
increasing the need for maintenance and repair. In France, the average mileage per passenger vehicle has grown


2


-----

steadily by approximately 1% per year over the 2011-2016 period. We believe that we will be well positioned to
take advantage of this evolution of mobility as distributors associated with a large garage network, such as us, are
expected to be partners of choice of fleet managers.

Light vehicle IAM distributors also have the benefit of a high level of visibility in terms of the future
addressable market of cars needing service and repair. The addressable market for the light vehicle IAM is cars
aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts
and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a result, we can project the size and composition
of the car parc that will require service in the five to ten-year range because car parc size, vehicle types and
installed technology are known from the point of production. We generally service cars over a long period of
time (from five to twenty years), which may require multiple repairs and parts replacements over their lifespan.
We distribute parts for cars that span the entire car parc, covering a wide range of makes and models, giving us a
wider addressable market compared to our OE car dealer network competitors who generally distribute parts for
cars from just one manufacturer.

**_Well-known light vehicle and truck spare parts distributor with critical scale in a fragmented Western_**
**_European market_**

In addition to the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket being highly attractive,
economies of scale favor larger distributors such as ourselves. Extensive logistics, technology and network
investments are necessary to service a broad and fragmented customer base seeking the supply of several million
SKUs for rapid and continuous delivery and the difficulty in building sufficient brand awareness and long-term
relationships with suppliers that are necessary to negotiate competitive pricing. As a result, suppliers can secure
more business when going through us to distribute their products as they can access a wide range of customers,
and therefore they also benefit from our scale. The necessary investments to deliver economies of scale in our
market also present a barrier to entry to competitors in a currently fragmented market. The Western European
light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is fragmented with the top 10 players in Europe representing
approximately 17% of the market in 2018, which also provides significant potential for consolidation, giving an
edge to large distributors, such as ourselves, who are able to service the entire value chain and make strategic
acquisitions.

The increasing technical complexity of spare parts in the automotive industry is also favorable to us. The
higher complexity and value of repair operations are difficult to manage by small independent aftermarket
players without support and technical assistance from expert distributors such as ourselves and drives a strong
and structural increase in spare parts prices and margins. Future technological evolutions are partly driven by the
increasing popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles and of mobility and connectivity services. We forecast that
5.1% of addressable cars will be electric or hybrid by 2030. We also believe that by 2030 up to 1.1% of
addressable cars will benefit from automated driving systems which will result in higher prices of components
for these vehicles. Furthermore, as a result of the focus on safety and aesthetics, light vehicle body parts have
improved in quality, from steel-made to aluminum and carbon fiber-made products, which has also increased
prices of the body parts that we distribute. A carbon fiber bumper, for example, is four times more expensive
than the current glass fiber bumpers.

We are able to combine the significant advantage of having a well-known and trusted core brand with the
ability to use affiliated garage networks to target specific markets. Our superior brand awareness is evidence of
our strong positioning in the IAMs in which we operate. According to an independent third-party survey
conducted in France in 2017, the “Autodistribution” brand enjoyed the highest brand awareness among its light
vehicle distributor peers in France, with 92% brand awareness (including unprompted awareness of 74% and
prompted awareness of 18%). The second ranking player in France had only 37% brand awareness. The
“Autodistribution” brand also had a net promoter score of 59% in 2017; the two second ranking players had net
promoter scores of 31%.

**_Differentiated and successfully integrated omni-channel business model_**

One of our key strengths is our control over the value chain through our omni-channel operational model
that delivers superior product availability and best-in-class delivery lead times. Our distribution is carried out by
a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who distribute
our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail locations and
online players. Our ability to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and distribution, to
customers has a strong impact on margins. For example, our automated platforms enable us to centralize more


3


-----

flows, which in turn generates logistics fees from suppliers. Generally, the logistics fees we charge to suppliers
are greater than the logistics costs we incur. Our unique operational model is founded on our long-standing
relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms and an extensive Western
European distribution network. We have a broad and loyal customer base to whom we deliver a wide range of
value-added services. We have also been able to adapt this business model to the markets in which we operate.
We have also been able to adapt this business model to our markets in Belgium and Italy, where distribution is
organized in three steps with “jobbers” acting as intermediaries between distributors and B2B end-customers
(these jobbers are our direct customers instead of garages).

Our model is based on the distinctive, dual proposition of distributing products to customers coupled with
providing value-added services (many of which are digital or online services) to both suppliers and customers.
To suppliers, our scale offers a unique access to a wide, diversified and fragmented customer base, which
suppliers are not able to efficiently address themselves. We have built long-term relationships and enjoy
significant purchasing power with a strategically concentrated group of suppliers, with whom we can leverage
our scale to obtain excellent purchasing conditions for our CPUs. Through this supplier concentration strategy,
we have rationalized our supplier relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to
approximately 260 in 2019. We also offer suppliers a number of value-added services, such as marketing support
and access to our state-of-the-art automated warehousing capabilities which allow suppliers to arrange deliveries
to a single delivery point.


4


-----

To customers, we provide a comprehensive product offering and best-in-class delivery times (h+2 delivery
time on 90% of B2B customer demand) combined with value-added services, such as commercial, technical and
training support, strong and integrated branding and online tools. As a result of our combined product and
services offerings, we are a “one-stop” shop to our customers, which we believe strengthens customer loyalty and
drives market share gain. Unlike many of our competitors, our product range is not limited to certain OEM or
original equipment suppliers (“OES”) parts or to certain types of products. Our product offering covers
approximately 600,000 SKUs (excluding Oscaro) across the spare parts universe, including repair and
maintenance parts, body parts, repairer equipment, oil, tires, consumables and accessories. Additionally, we have
developed our own private label brands: ISOTECH, Xenergy and Requal, which allow us to offer premium grade
products approximately 20% to 30% cheaper than our OEM counterparts and to efficiently target the older part
of the car parc which is subject to a higher price sensitivity. The ongoing centralization of sourcing across our
private label brands allows us to generate higher margins on our private label products compared to third-party
branded products, despite the lower price of the former. We are also well positioned to address mobility shifts, in
particular with our customers involved in fleet management, through which public fleets play an increasingly
important role. With our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and extensive range of value-added customer service
solutions, we are well positioned to meet the needs of fleet operators who look to external supply and fleet
management on a large scale.

In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution models for our Light Vehicle
France and Trucks segments, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic
investments in our automated logistics platforms. We are currently finalizing the implementation of a new
distribution model for our Trucks segment which has allowed us to grow our network of affiliated garages and to
reorganize our former network of 125 distribution sites around 10 regional warehouses as of December 31, 2019,
which can better focus on distribution to local sites, owned and independent garages and integrated workshops.
As a result of this reorganization, we have been able to better utilize our large network and unique range of
value-added services to meet customer demand and we became the only player in the French truck spare parts
market able to serve our full range of customers with two daily deliveries made within four hours.

**_Comprehensive approach to digital solutions in the B2B market_**

A number of our services to suppliers and customers are digital or online services, including our B2B online
order portals, such as Autossimo, Truckissimo and Salto, and our e-book, online training offerings (through Grup
Eina) and multi-brand online diagnostic tool (Diag’issimo). Our B2B car repair and maintenance portals increase
the integration of our distribution business with our technical support capacities, helping us increase customer
loyalty. We also offer online tools for our customers’ clientele, such as the ID Garages online portal, which
allows drivers to schedule maintenance appointments, compare prices and receive quotes for work to be
performed on their vehicles. These services and tools enable our customers to expand their business.

Our approach to capturing the advantages created by an increasingly digitalized ecosystem stretches across
every level of our business. We use digital tools to bolster our value-added services offering to suppliers and
customers, expand our product offering, address a growing online customer base and digitize our operational
model. We therefore believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing importance of the digital
marketplace, which is the fastest growing independent aftermarket distribution channel in France and grew at a
CAGR of 11.4% between 2014 and 2018.

We have also made deep and long-standing investments to increase our web dealer customer base and gain
exposure to the online distribution market. As part of this strategy, we acquired ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in
2016, two distribution platforms dedicated to web dealers. We accelerated this market penetration strategy at the
end of 2018 with the acquisition of Oscaro.

**_Strong growth potential through our B2C (DIY) and B2C businesses_**

In November 2018, we became a direct player in the web dealer market and entered into the online B2C
distribution market through our opportunistic acquisition of Oscaro, the leader in online sales of light vehicle
spare parts in France. Oscaro’s acquisition allowed us to become a truly “omni-channel” distributor in France
and the only multichannel B2C (DIY) player in the independent aftermarket auto parts distribution sector in
Europe. In 2019, we served approximately 2.5 million customers in France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal,
received approximately 12,000 orders a day and a portfolio of approximately 1 million SKUs through Oscaro.
Oscaro has a strong leadership in the growing French online light vehicle spare parts aftermarket with an
approximate market share of over 47% in 2019, mainly due to its customer loyalty and high brand awareness.


5


-----

Oscaro was the first entrant in the online distribution market in France and benefits from an outstanding brand
awareness in France due to its compelling value proposition and expertise (approximately 62% awareness, which
is more than three times as much as its closest competitor on the online distribution market).

Oscaro’s leading market share, superior purchasing terms and, following its integration within the Group,
competitive price strategy positions it well to compete against generalist online players. The automotive spare
parts distribution business requires a very detailed product offering, a highly technical catalog and data
repository, to address a wide range of parts for a multitude of vehicles of various brands, that generalist online
players have difficulty offering as they primarily focus on consumables. In addition, they cannot replicate the
purchasing terms we obtain through our win-win partnerships with suppliers.

**_Successful track record of delivering organic growth supported by accretive acquisition strategy,_**

With over 55 years of experience in our industry, we have built the relationships, infrastructure and
know-how that we believe are critical to success in the Western European light vehicle and truck IAMs. Our
revenue grew from €968.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to €1.8 billion in the year ended
December 31, 2019, with an average organic growth of approximately 3.5% per annum over the period. Over the
same period, profitability also grew. In the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA was €83.1 million
and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.6%. In the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16
increased to €202.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin was 11.2%. The average organic growth in
Adjusted EBITDA was approximately 6.3% per annum over the 2015 to 2019 period.

Our organic growth has been supported by various factors, such as the development of our distribution
model (which has bolstered our offering to customers, thus leading to market share gains), our exposure to fastgrowing channels (such as web dealers), our successful recruiting of new branded garages, the development of
our private-label offers, improved purchasing conditions obtained through our supplier concentration strategy
and our distribution network optimization strategy. In recent years we have demonstrated stable organic growth
overall, particularly in the resilient light vehicle IAM, as a result of good purchasing conditions with suppliers,
network rationalization, recruitment of approximately 70 AD branded garages (net) per year from 2010 to 2019
with a churn rate of less than 5% and the disposal of non-core assets. Our model is based in part on the delivery
of value-added services to both suppliers and customers. These value-added services not only generate fees from
suppliers but also promote loyalty from customers, helping us grow our market share.

In addition, we have a strong track record of pursuing value-enhancing acquisitions and successfully
realizing synergies with such targets. In the past six years, we have made 13 sizeable acquisitions. We acquired
over €800 million in revenue through acquisitions since 2014, of which the 2014 acquisition of ACR in France
accounted for approximately €92 million, the 2016 acquisitions of Doyen Auto in the Netherlands and Automax
in France collectively accounted for approximately €174 million, the 2017 acquisitions of ADB in Belgium,
OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto in Italy and Mondial Pare-Brise in France collectively accounted for approximately
€147 million, the 2018 acquisitions of Geevers in the Netherlands, G-Group in Italy, Verviers Freins in Belgium
and Oscaro in France collectively accounted for approximately €355 million and the 2019 acquisition of AD
Bosch in Spain accounted for an annualized revenue of approximately €62 million.

Each of these acquisitions has been supported by a clear external growth strategy focused on neighboring
European countries with similar car parcs to France and targeting strong local leaders with potential to quickly
generate purchasing synergies, align interests with management, expand the reach of our operations and increase
exposure to fast-growing segments and markets. We have a strong track record of successful integrations in our
Group, and our acquisitions have demonstrated favorable pre- and post-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiples
(calculated as enterprise value divided by EBITDA) as well as our ability to grow revenue and EBITDA
following an acquisition:

   - _ACR: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as compared with post-synergy_
multiple of approximately 4x;

   - _Doyen-Auto: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 12x, as compared with post-_
synergy multiple of approximately 5x;

   - _Mondial Pare-Brise: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 9x, as compared with_
post-synergy multiple of approximately 6x; and

   - _OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 10x, as_
compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 7x.

-----

In addition, we implemented various initiatives following our acquisition of Oscaro and brought Oscaro
back to profitability in the third quarter of the year 2019 and reaching positive EBITDA for the full year 2019.
These initiatives were part of a comprehensive turnaround plan addressing Oscaro’s key issues through increased
client communication, PR and marketing spend and the implementation of full client and suppliers overdue
payment and full customer refund plans. In addition to these immediate actions taken following the acquisition of
Oscaro, we sought to further enhance Oscaro’s profitability through purchasing synergies, supply chain and
delivery optimizations and competitive pricing. We also sought to increase Oscaro’s integration to our Group’s
culture and governance by strengthening its management team and implementing clear processes.

**_A strong financial profile delivering an attractive combination of resilient growth, margin improvement, low_**
**_capital expenditure and high cash conversion_**

We have grown our revenue from €968.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to €1.8 billion in the
year ended December 31, 2019. This reflects a CAGR of 17.0% between the year ended December 31, 2015 and
2019, with average organic growth of approximately 3.5% per annum over the 2015 to 2019 period.

We increased our Adjusted EBITDA from €83.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to
€154.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2019. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020, which illustrates the effects that acquisitions would have had if such acquisitions had taken
effect on April 1, 2019 was €219.9 million.

We operate a business model that requires a relatively low capital expenditure, using rented facilities
without needing to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the year ended December 31, 2019,
our capital expenditures amounted to 2.2% of our revenue and consisted of maintenance expenditures for our
distribution facilities and upgrades to our sales and warehouse IT management systems. Our low level of capital
expenditures has been stable in recent years, with capital expenditure for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2018 and 2019, at 2.2%, 2.2% and 2.2% of revenue, respectively (excluding Logisteo for the year ended
December 31, 2017). Our low levels of maintenance capital expenditure requirements have allowed us to invest
in our business in order to maintain our leading market positions and improve operating efficiency, as well as
achieve deleveraging through EBITDA growth and cash generation. Our cash conversion rate was 47.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with 89.9% and 50.9% in the years ended December 31, 2017 and
2018, respectively.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsor_**

We operate under the stewardship of an experienced and successful management team with a proven track
record in European B2B distribution and international expansion, coupled with a supportive sponsor. Our CEO,
Mr. Stéphane Antiglio, and CFO, Mr. Christophe Gouthière, have a proven track record in developing and
implementing turnaround and growth strategies. Mr. Stéphane Antiglio is the former CEO of Pomona Passion
Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Mr. Christophe Gouthière was previously European CFO
of the Dole Group, a leading distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our CEO and CFO are supported by an
experienced management team and, together, they have successfully implemented profit improvement initiatives
and integrated thirteen new businesses into the Group in the last seven years. For example, our management team
successfully integrated ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in 2016, realizing higher purchasing and cost savings and
revenue enhancements than those identified at the time ACR and Doyen Auto were acquired. Our management
team has also delivered consistent organic growth while expanding margins, rolling out the implementation of
Logisteo and pursuing successful expansion into new geographies, products and channels.

Additionally, our management team has implemented a comprehensive and sustainable human resources
policy aimed at achieving the right balance of a profitable business mindset, global strategy and cooperative
social environment and we were awarded the “2019 Best Employer” distinction by the French magazine Capital
in 2018. We believe that the success of our management team in completing our profit improvement plan and
returning our business to profitable growth since 2010 has laid a solid foundation for further growth and
increased profitability. The support, investment experience and sector expertise of our sponsor, Bain Capital,
supplement the leadership and expertise of our management team.

**Our strategy**

Our strategy is to continue growing organically by leveraging our history of operational excellence that
focuses on offering a superior supplier and customer experience, to become the key consolidator in the
fragmented markets in which we operate by using our proven approach to M&A and to develop our online
segment and our position as a fully multi-channel player.


7


-----

In terms of organic growth, we intend to grow revenues and continue to outperform the markets in which we
operate by continuing to apply and enhance our operational model based on a fully-integrated supply chain and
the distinctive suite of value-added digital and commercial services that we offer to our customers and suppliers.
In particular, we intend to capitalize on our value-added services in order to differentiate ourselves from our
competitors, increase customer loyalty and gain market share.

In terms of M&A-led growth, we are focused on improving Adjusted EBITDA in terms of absolute value
and Adjusted EBITDA margin. In order to do this, we put increasing focus on executing value-accretive M&A
transactions and successfully and efficiently integrating acquired businesses into the Group.

In terms of our multi-channel approach, we intend to continue to grow our online product offering in France
and in other markets and to strengthen our position in the B2C (DIY) segment.

**_Continue to reinforce our distribution models to gain market share on the French light vehicle IAM_**

In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution model for our Light Vehicle France
segment, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic investments in our automated
logistics platforms. We aim to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer service, rationalize flows and
optimize inventory and warehousing. We focus on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the regional
level, while maintaining excellent delivery times.

For example, since 2014, we have redesigned and refined our Light Vehicle France distribution model,
moving from a large number of delivery sites acting as intermediaries between suppliers and our logistics
platforms and garage customers, to a more precisely deployed network of regional pivot sites that connect
suppliers and our logistics platforms with local delivery sites, which are strategically located to address customer
demand. A key component of this strategy is our ongoing efforts to grow our affiliated network of garages. In
2017, we further enhanced our Light Vehicle France distribution model by introducing a fully automated national
logistic platform (Logisteo) that enabled same-day stock deliveries to distributors in France. Logisteo allowed us
to significantly improve our distribution model by increasing the consolidation of our supply flows to a single
delivery point from 18% in 2014 to 64% in 2018 resulting in approximately 30% gain in productivity.

We expect that our new model will further improve distributor performance with optimized inventory levels
and SKU availability and an increased ability to adapt our offer to local customer requirements, leading to an
enhanced customer experience. We continue to seek ways to optimize our operations and business model to
further improve delivery times, quality of service and availability of products, each of which are expected to help
us gain greater market share in the geographies where we operate.

**_Increase exposure to higher growth businesses_**

In recent years, we have undertaken specific steps to focus on and penetrate superior growth businesses in
the aftermarket spare parts distribution market: online web dealers, body parts and windshields. We have
developed our online presence with external web dealers through the acquisitions of ACR and Doyen Auto, two
platforms focused on web dealers, to become their expert distribution partner. We believe that business with web
dealers present superior growth opportunities, and we intend to further increase our exposure to these customers
in the coming years. For example, we established a key account unit between ACR and Doyen Auto to focus on
web dealers. Our strategic partnership with Oscaro, launched in 2013, was also part of this strategy. We then
increased our presence in the online distribution business when we acquired Oscaro in November 2018, and we
have engaged in a strategic plan to become a European leader in online automotive spare parts by consolidating
our position in France and in Western Europe, mainly Spain, Belgium and Italy, with a focus on EBITDA
generation.

We also believe that the body parts and windshield segment represents a high growth business. Following
significant market share gains in this segment, we invested in the development of the Cora distribution platform
in France and in 2018 completed the acquisition of Geevers, a body parts specialist in the Netherlands. We also
entered the windshield segment through our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise in 2017, a retail business focused
on glazing repair, and have focused on the development of a sizeable presence in France, reaching 324
workshops in 2018. We intend to expand the reach of our current platforms and develop a distribution service to
external glazing repair players by leveraging our scale and purchase expertise. In addition, we intend to pursue
the development of Mondial Pare-Brise, aiming to add 15 Urban Master Centers in large cities in France by
2025.

-----

**_Continue to improve our purchasing, pricing and logistics capabilities_**

We intend to continue to leverage the strength of our CPU by increasing the share of purchases from
referenced suppliers, notably from acquired companies outside of France. We aim to pursue the optimization of
our supplier relationships and to further improve purchasing terms with our growing negotiating power due to
our European scale and our optimized logistics, while maintaining a sufficient number of suppliers to avoid
undue reliance on any particular suppliers. We also see further opportunities to concentrate our supply flows and
plan to select no more than two or three suppliers per product or sub-category of product in the near future. We
expect that this strategy will continue to improve product availability and profitability.

In addition, we intend to continue expanding our private label offerings, by deepening our sourcing in Asia
while maintaining high quality standards. We also intend to introduce private label offerings in our acquired
businesses and ensure supplier concentration. Our expansion strategy for our private label offerings is expected
to optimize production costs, while increasing volumes sold per SKU and allowing us to negotiate improved
purchasing conditions with the suppliers of these products, in turn leading to profitable growth through margin
expansion.

**_Reinforce cost efficiency initiatives at both local distribution and central and administrative levels_**

We operate a fully-integrated supply chain that connects our strategically concentrated group of suppliers to
our CPUs and state-of-the-art logistics platforms, through to an extensive distribution network that serves more
than 70,000 customers with deliveries several times per day and with best-in-class delivery times. We intend to
build on our history of operational excellence by continuing to integrate and rationalize our supply chain to
improve cost efficiency. We believe this approach will help us maintain and further enhance our strong and
unique positioning as a central distribution intermediary for all value chain levels and to reinforce our role as an
important link between parts suppliers and customers. Based on the value that we have extracted from
operational improvements in recent years, we believe that continual improvements to our supply chain will
contribute to increased market share and expanded margins. For example, our increasing use of centralized,
automated platforms simplifies the delivery processes for our suppliers by offering them a single delivery point.
We also offer suppliers a range of innovative value-added services such as marketing tools and intelligence,
online support tools, payment guarantees and a centralized invoicing system with simplified back office support,
all of which help suppliers grow their own business while creating greater efficiencies through simplified
tracking, delivery, monitoring and payment solutions. We believe that these services represent advantages that
are a “win-win” proposition for us and our suppliers, differentiating us from our competitors.

We are also pursuing increased integration of our supply chain, which is based on two flows of spare parts:
a “direct delivery flow” from suppliers to distributors and a “platform-based flow” through our logistics
platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2019, 64% of our products were distributed via our logistics platform,
as compared with 18% in 2010, representing an improvement that we intend to pursue by further developing our
platform-based flow. This approach is expected to improve product availability and delivery times while being
cost efficient and generating favorable financial conditions for us, due in part to the higher logistics fees which
we can apply in this context, and which we expect will lead to higher margins, as the logistics fees received from
suppliers generally exceed the related costs of operating the logistics platforms. In particular, our new, automated
platforms, such as Logisteo, generally offer a doubled capacity for SKUs as well as doubled processing capacity,
allowing us to offer more SKUs from a wider range of product lines and suppliers. We will pursue this strategy
by encouraging new suppliers to make deliveries through the platform flow from the outset as well as by having
existing supplies expand the breadth of their range offered through our platform-based flow.

In addition, we believe that our extensive distribution network is a key part to our success. We employ a
cost-conscious approach to manage our distribution network, constantly focusing on improving network
efficiency and coverage, while minimizing or eliminating redundancies wherever possible. For example, in our
Light Vehicle France segment, we are currently focused on ongoing upgrades to our real estate parc and
improvements to the size and coverage of our footprint of distribution sites in France. When and where
necessary, we remodel, close or consolidate sites. We also work to lower and rationalize downstream logistics
costs by maximizing the square footage of our sites and by modernizing our logistics and monitoring functions,
such as through the increased use of bar coding and the creation of a dedicated logistics department. In our
Trucks segment, we are implementing an improvement plan that is focused on closing low- and non-performing
sites in the context of a broader profit-focused effort to optimize our distribution network.

**_Pursue the consolidation of Western Europe markets via targeted acquisitions and diversify our presence in_**
**_existing markets by leveraging our integration track record to deliver maximum profitability potential_**

In recent years, we have implemented a number of successful acquisitions, demonstrating the strength and
discipline of our M&A process. This M&A process is centered around careful evaluation of potential targets,
which are usually selected from local leaders that offer significant purchasing synergies. Through strategic
acquisitions, we have penetrated new geographies, for example through our acquisitions of Doyen Auto and AD
Bosch, which allowed us to expand into Benelux and Spain, respectively, as well as broaden our reach or product
offering in the countries in which we already operate, for example through our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise,
which allowed us to offer a full range of windscreen replacement products in France. In addition, through the
acquisition of Oscaro in France, we have penetrated the B2C (DIY) segment and strengthened our position in the
e-commerce market. We intend to leverage our market knowledge to continue to roll-out Oscaro to our markets
outside of France.

We intend to continue making strategic, value-accretive acquisitions in the short and the medium term,
including in certain geographies adjacent to the countries in which we operate. We intend to focus on new
geographies where the car parcs are similar enough to those in which we are already active to realize synergies
and where we can effectively use our logistics platforms and distribution networks.

We also intend to consolidate our leadership in the countries where we are already present, building on areas
of strength and taking advantage of the fragmented nature of these markets. We believe that the consolidation of
these markets will accelerate following the COVID-19 crisis, driven by small players that we believe are likely to
have been impacted by liquidity constraints to a greater extent than ourselves. We further intend to leverage our
expertise in our Light Vehicle France segment to expand and diversify our presence in other countries by
undertaking proven successful initiatives. For example, we are in the process of strengthening the
Autodistribution brand in Belgium and the Netherlands, expanding our product range in Italy, notably in our
private label offerings and body part product range, and growing our online penetration with high-momentum
customers such as web dealers in Belgium.

**_Build on Oscaro’s successful turnaround to deliver strong and profitable growth_**

Our digital services are a key factor that differentiate us from our competitors. We intend to continue
growing our digital offering in order to capitalize on this competitive advantage. Following the strategic
acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, the leading online seller of light vehicle spare parts in France, we
implemented a comprehensive turnaround plan which allowed us to bring Oscaro back to profitability in the third
quarter of 2019, strengthened our online distribution channel and allowed us to become an “omni-channel”
aftermarket spare parts distributor in France. We estimate that the full year effect of the acquisition of Oscaro
would represent a contribution to our Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of approximately €21 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, after taking into account the run-rate impact of our turnaround plan for Oscaro
already completed (approximately €7 million) and of additional cost optimization measures and purchasing
synergies to be implemented (approximately €10 million), including overhead and supply chain cost reduction
and new growth initiatives.

We intend to build on Oscaro’s successful turnaround to deliver our online growth strategy and become a
leading European auto parts online retailer with sustainable margins by 2025. Our strategy consists in
strengthening Oscaro’s position in France by reinforcing its position on current categories, developing new
categories, such as commercial vehicles, and by improving the customer experience through the website but also
with a better customer service throughout the delivery chain. We also intend to improve Oscaro’s profitability by
optimizing supply chain costs and leveraging our scale. Furthermore, we also intend to expand Oscaro’s presence
internationally by capturing profitable growth in Spain and Belgium and launching local websites in Germany,
Italy and the Netherlands, starting in 2021. Finally, we intend to support Oscaro’s strategic development plan by
implementing several IT initiatives such as the introduction of an advanced CRM, the improvement of financial
flows traceability and reporting and the setting-up of middle office capabilities.

**_Finalize operational transformation to consolidate our leading position in the Trucks segment and increase_**
**_our margins_**

We are focused on operational improvements in our Trucks segment and we have finalized the
implementation of a new distribution model in 2019 which allowed us to grow our network of affiliated garages
and to reorganize our former network of 125 distribution sites around 10 regional warehouses focused on
distribution to local sites, owned and independent garages and integrated workshops. As a result of this

-----

reorganization, we are better able to utilize our large network and unique range of value-added services to meet
customer demand. We also became the only player in the French truck spare parts aftermarket that is able to
serve customers with two daily deliveries made within four hours.

We intend to further consolidate our leading position in the Trucks segment and increase our margins in this
business. We aim to expand the coverage of our AD Poids Lourds network to 250 repair service and distribution
sites by 2025. In addition, we intend to introduce new products and services and focus on key accounts while
undertaking targeted pricing initiatives. Finally, a key element of our strategy is the ongoing implementation of
our new distribution model to improve efficiency and customer service in our Truck segment. We believe that
these measures will allow us to consolidate our leading position in the Trucks segment and increase our margins.

**_Maintain a positive social environment to recruit and retain talent by focusing on development opportunities_**

We believe that attracting and retaining talented people is critical to our success and believe that the key to
attracting and retaining talented employees is offering development and growth opportunities in the context of a
positive social environment. We have focused our management strategy on achieving the right balance of a
profitable business mindset, a global strategy and a cooperative social climate. We intend to maintain our strong
corporate culture with a human resources strategy that focuses on creating and sustaining an experienced,
motivated and stable workforce. In order to do this, our human resources strategy is, and will continue to be,
organized around four pillars: (i) successful talent recruitment, supported by marketing events, educational
collaborations and digital initiatives, (ii) development of employees through training partnerships, e-learning and
talent appraisal and evaluation processes, (iii) a cost-efficient approach to benefits through payroll monitoring,
unified compensation policies, profit sharing mechanisms and favorable social protection schemes and (iv) the
development of a positive social environment through automation, continuous improvement of working
conditions, investments in work spaces and workforce rationalization.

**Recent Developments**

**_Actions implemented following the COVID-19 outbreak_**

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19
(“COVID-19”), was reported in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus has since spread, and infections have been found
in the vast majority of countries around the world, including throughout Europe. In March 2020, the World
Health Organization recognized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the global spread of the disease,
the severity of illnesses it causes and its effects on society. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the
governments of many countries, states and cities have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing
restrictions on travel and business operations, and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time
outside of their homes. Accordingly, the COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic
activity in many countries, including in regions in which we operate, and continues to adversely impact global
economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. For a discussion of the impact
of COVID-19 on our results for the three months ended March 31, 2020, see “Management’s discussion and
_analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to_
_three months ended March 31, 2019.”_

During the initial phase of the lockdown, we retained a limited level of activity following our decision to
remain open as a corporate citizen (“Entreprise Citoyenne”) in all our markets, notably to help public services
and essential workers fighting the pandemic. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took immediate action
to help our employees and partners during the crisis and to ensure the continuity of essential mobility in France.
We also provided remote working solutions to all eligible employees and put in place dedicated processes to
ensure high levels of safety for our workforces in the distribution activity. Since May 11, 2020, the French
government has lifted the strict lockdown and has gradually removed restrictions and social distancing measures.
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the majority of our employees have physically returned to work
and our remote working activities have almost ceased.

During the initial phase of the lockdown measures, we implemented certain cost control measures by
(1) leveraging government initiatives in the markets in which we operate, such as the French temporary
unemployment scheme (chômage partiel), and (2) implementing a temporary freeze on discretionary spending
and capital expenditures. These targeted measures have helped to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our
profitability. For a discussion of the financial impact of COVID-19 see “—COVID-19 financial impact and
_recovery.”_

We also took pro-active steps to protect our liquidity by (1) taking advantage of government incentives such as
tax and/or social charges deferral, (2) entering into government-backed financing or additional credit lines with
local banks in the markets in which we operate (see “—COVID-19 related financing”), (3) undertaking constructive
discussions with our largest suppliers to obtain the earlier payment of year-end rebates, and to adapt the timing of
our payments to suppliers accordingly, and (4) enhancing cash collections from our customers, despite granting
payment deferrals to our most affected customers and partners. We also anticipate a positive impact on liquidity
from the CICE tax credit. As a result of these measures, we had €167.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of
March 31, 2020 and approximately €173 million of cash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2020. We estimate that
our cash on balance sheet as of June 22, 2020 was approximately €135 million after excluding the one-off working
capital impact of the measures we took to preserve our liquidity following the COVID-19 outbreak. This liquidity
position reflects a net drawdown of approximately €8.5 million of new debt facilities as of June 22, 2020, but does
not reflect approximately €50 million of additional credit lines that may be drawn subsequently, including under the
PGE Loan and other COVID-19 related financing arrangements that we have entered into or that we are in the
process of obtaining in certain of our markets (see “—COVID-19 related financing”) .

**_COVID-19 financial impact and recovery_**

_April 2020_

Our revenue decreased in April 2020 by 47.1% from €147.9 million for the month ended April 30, 2019, to
approximately €78.3 million for the month ended April 30, 2020, and our organic revenue decreased by 48.3% in
April 2020 compared to April 2019. We had negative Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €1.7 million for the
month ended April 30, 2020, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of €12.7 million for the month ended April 30, 2019.
This decrease in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA was due to the impact of the initial lockdown measures in response
to COVID-19 in the markets in which we operate. This decrease was partly offset by the mitigating measures that
we implemented and our ability to attract new customers, which represented approximately 20% of our sales during
the initial lockdown period in France. During this period, we have also benefited from our diversified business
model, with operations in markets less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the Netherlands, and the
resilience of online sales through Oscaro. We had a positive change in working capital of €14.1 million for the
month ended April 30, 2020, compared to a negative change in working capital of €7.6 million for the month ended
April 30, 2019. Our net capital expenditures were €1.2 million for the month ended April 30, 2020, compared to
€2.6 million for the month ended April 30, 2019. Our net operating cash flow was €10.4 million for the month
ended April 30, 2020, compared to €2.5 million for the month ended April 30, 2019.

_May 2020_

Our revenue decreased by 14.4% from €147.6 million for the month ended May 31, 2019, to approximately
€126.3 million for the month ended May 31, 2020, and our organic revenue decreased by 17.1% in May 2020
compared to May 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA in May 2020 decreased by approximately €3.7 million, or 26.5%,
from €13.9 million for the month ended May 31, 2019, to €10.2 million for the month ended May 31, 2020. This
decrease in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA was due to the impact of the lockdown measures in the markets in
which we operate. Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in May 2020 were positively impacted by the easing of the
strict lockdown measures from May 11, 2020, particularly in France and Italy. In addition, we benefited in May
from our decision to remain open during the initial phase of the lockdown as our business was operational when
governments started to ease lockdown measures. Our Adjusted EBITDA also benefitted from the cost control
measures implemented at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We had a positive change in working capital of
€20.4 million for the month ended May 31, 2020, compared to a negative change in working capital of
€17.6 million for the month ended May 31, 2019. Our net capital expenditures were €1.3 million for the month
ended May 31, 2020, compared to €2.5 million for the month ended May 31, 2019. Our net operating cash flow was
€29.3 million for the month ended May 31, 2020, compared to negative €6.2 million for the month ended May 31,
2019 with our sales for the third week of May 2020 being stable compared to sales for the same period last year.

_June 2020_

Our revenue increased by 20.7% from €150.0 million for the month ended June 30, 2019, to approximately
€181.0 million for the month ended June 30, 2020, and our organic revenue increased approximately 16.7%
compared to the month ended June 30, 2019, as we have continued to benefit from the easing of the lockdown
measures in our geographies. The increase in revenue for June 2020 is in line with the organic growth of our
business prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. We also expect our Adjusted EBITDA margin for June 2020 to be
meaningfully higher than our Adjusted EBITDA margin for June 2019 and our Adjusted EBITDA for June 2020
to be higher than our Adjusted EBITDA for June 2019.

While it is too early to assess whether the economic downturn that is likely to follow the COVID-19
pandemic will have a material impact on our growth in 2020 and beyond, we believe we operate in a resilient
market with strong fundamentals and structural trends that we expect will benefit us, such as the nondiscretionary nature of our services, an increasingly ageing car parc due to a significant drop in volumes of new
car sales during the lockdown, additional opportunities for market consolidation due to the impact of the
lockdown on smaller players and, as a result of the pandemic, the reluctance of the public to use public transport.
During the lockdown, we also benefited from our increased online sales through our Oscaro platform and our
Autossimo platform, whose sales grew by 42% in June 2020 compared to June 2019. We also believe that the
IAM will continue to grow as mobility returns to normal levels and we will be able to capitalize on market shares
gained during the lockdown, as a result of remaining open during the initial phase of the lockdown, to reinforce
our position in Western Europe. We cannot predict, however, the degree to which, or the time period over which,
our businesses will be affected by this pandemic and its impact on the economic conditions in the geographies in
which we operate or a potential second outbreak of COVID-19 or of another communicable disease. See
“Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—Any outbreak of severe
_communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.”_

**_COVID-19 related financing_**

Since March 31, 2020, we have entered into certain government-backed loans or loans with certain of our
local commercial banks to enhance our liquidity. On July 1, 2020, we entered into a €25.0 million governmentbacked loan agreement in France among, inter alios, the Issuer, BNP Paribas and Société Générale (the “PGE
Loan”). Drawing under the PGE Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
publication of a decision (arreˆte´ ministe´riel) by the French government to confirm the guarantee of the loan by
the French State. We cannot guarantee that the French government will issue this arreˆte´ ministe´riel and that we
will be able to draw on the PGE Loan. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—PGE Loan.”

In addition, we have entered into government-backed loans or loans with local commercial banks and increased
certain of our existing lines of credit to strengthen our liquidity position in Italy (€5.0 million), Spain (€5.0 million), the
Netherlands (€4.0 million) and Belgium (€7.5 million) in May and June 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
We may enter into additional loans in other countries in which we operate, to the extent available.

(1) Bain Capital and certain other existing investors, including members of management and certain Affiliated Distributors,
beneficially own 100% of the share capital of LuxCo 5, LuxCo 6, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor indirectly through whollyowned or majority-owned intermediate holding companies. Percentages refer to the percentage ownership of equity and equity-like
instruments. See “Principal shareholders.”

(2) On the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering, to (i) fund the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes
Redemption, (ii) fund the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Redemption and (iii) pay the fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the foregoing. See “Use of proceeds” and “—The Refinancing.”

(3) Following the Refinancing on or about the Issue Date, €443.0 million of Existing 2016 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will
remain outstanding under the Existing 2016 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and €138.0 million of Existing 2019 Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes will remain outstanding under the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

-----

(4) The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future
obligation of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the
Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and future hedging obligations (if any),
will rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes and will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer and its subsidiaries,
including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and future hedging obligations (if any), that are secured
by property and assets of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and
assets.

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) by Parts Holding Europe S.A.S. (formerly Autodis Group
S.A.S.) (the “Parent Guarantor”) and Autodistribution S.A.S. (the “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the Parent Guarantor,
the “Guarantors”). As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding equity
investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 30.3% of the consolidated total
assets, 6.8% of the consolidated revenue and 25.3% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. The Guarantees will be
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will also be limited as
necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under
applicable law, or otherwise reflect limitation under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under
its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to an
amount not greater than the outstanding amount under existing proceeds loans, which is approximately €330 million and
corresponds to the aggregate of the proceeds loan made available to on-lend the proceeds of prior issuances of Existing Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes and Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes to the Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the
Guarantors may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Corporate benefit,
_financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related_
_to our indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may_
_not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes,_
_the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of_
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

As of the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures, the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan will be secured by: (i) a first-priority pledge of the share capital of
LuxCo 6 held by LuxCo 5; (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, material bank accounts and material intragroup
receivables of the Parent Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis
shareholdings); (iv) first-priority security interests over certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution
S.A.S., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, its material bank accounts and its material intragroup
receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S.
and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A.S., (B) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material bank accounts and
(C) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material intragroup receivables. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” The
security interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law
and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations,
see “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security
_interests.”_

(5) The Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement provides for drawings of up to €100.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility,
which was fully drawn as of March 31, 2020, with €78.0 million of cash drawings and €22.0 million of guarantees. We expect the
Revolving Credit Facility to remain fully drawn following completion of the Refinancing. See “Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

On July 1, 2020, we entered into a €25.0 million government-backed PGE Loan in France in order to enhance our liquidity as a
response to COVID-19. Drawing under the PGE Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the publication
of a decision (arreˆte´ ministe´riel) by the French government to confirm the guarantee of the loan by the French State. We cannot
guarantee that the French government will issue this arreˆte´ ministe´riel and that we will be able to draw on the PGE Loan. See
“Description of certain financing arrangements—PGE Loan.”

Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan are secured by security interests over, among other things,
the Collateral. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the security interests over
the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, lenders under the PGE Loan and creditors of any future indebtedness incurred that is permitted to be incurred
on a super senior basis under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement have been repaid in full. Any remaining proceeds
received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the repayment of all obligations under the
Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the
Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes).
The indebtedness of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the PGE Loan is guaranteed by, and is secured
by certain assets of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee, and do not provide security in favor of, the Notes. See
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

(6) Certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31,
2020, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and
intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 69.7% of the consolidated total assets, 93.2% of the consolidated revenue and


16


-----

74.7% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. As of March 31, 2020, and after giving pro forma effect to the
Refinancing, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor had approximately €245 million of debt outstanding
(excluding bank overdrafts), of which approximately €156 million were incurred in connection with lease liabilities. See “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of_
_non-guarantor subsidiaries.” In addition, certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes have_
entered into government-backed loans or loans with local commercial banks and increased certain existing lines of credit to
strengthen our liquidity position in Italy (€5.0 million), Spain (€5.0 million), the Netherlands (€4.0 million) and Belgium (€7.5
million) in May and June 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We may enter into additional loans in other countries in
which we operate, to the extent available.

form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof maintained in book-entry form. Notes in
denominations of less than €100,000 will not be available.

**Ranking of the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will:

                         - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security”;

                         - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future
obligation of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer
under the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the
Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and certain future
hedging obligations (if any);

                         - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future
obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes;

                         - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of
the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and certain future
hedging obligations (if any), that is secured by property and
assets of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not secure the
Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets;

                         - be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors; and

                         - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligation
of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including
obligations to trade creditors and, to the extent drawings are
borrowed by such subsidiaries, obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility.

**Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture are
guaranteed by the Guarantors.

**Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . . . .** The Guarantees:

                         - are general obligations of the Guarantors, secured as set forth
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security”;


18


-----

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future
obligation of the respective Guarantor that is not subordinated in
right of payment to its Guarantee, including the obligations of
the Guarantors under the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures, the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and
certain future hedging obligations (if any);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future
obligation of the respective Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee;

- are effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation
of each Guarantor, which is secured by property and assets that
do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such obligation; and

- are structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor that are
not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors.

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, the Issuer
and the Guarantors (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for
30.3% of the consolidated total assets, 6.8% of the consolidated
revenue and 25.3% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent
Guarantor.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as
necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a
fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under
applicable law, or otherwise reflect limitations under applicable law.
By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of the
Subsidiary Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to an amount
not greater than the outstanding amount under existing proceeds
loans, which is approximately €330 million and corresponds to the
aggregate of the proceeds loan made available to on-lend the proceeds
of prior issuances of Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and
Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes to the Subsidiary
Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be similarly
limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the
_Notes—Corporate_ _benefit, financial assistance laws and other_
_limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers_
_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_
_of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk_
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The_
_insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the_
_case may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in_
_the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the_
_Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The_
validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

The Guarantees are also subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
recoveries in respect of the Guarantees will be required to be applied
to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit


19


-----

Facility, the PGE Loan and certain future indebtedness and hedging
obligations permitted to be incurred on a super senior basis under the
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“Description _of_ _certain_ _financing_ _arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.” The Guarantees will be subject to release under certain_
circumstances. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Notes
_Guarantees release.”_

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be secured by: (i) a first-priority pledge of the share
capital of LuxCo 6 held by LuxCo 5; (ii) a first-priority pledge of the
capital stock, material bank accounts and material intragroup
receivables of the Parent Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the
capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis
shareholdings); (iv) first-priority security interests over certain assets
of the Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A.S.,
Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, its
material bank accounts and its material intragroup receivables; and
(v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital stock of Commerce
Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest
S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A.S., (B) Autodistribution S.A.’s
material bank accounts and (C) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material
intragroup receivables. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Security.”_

The Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and future hedging
obligations (if any) (the “Super Senior Obligations”) are secured by
first-priority security interests over, among other things, the
Collateral, contractually ranking pari passu with the security interests
securing the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
in the event of enforcement of the security interests over the
Collateral, holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral
only after the Super Senior Obligations have been repaid. The
security interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to
recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law
and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable
law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the first-priority security
interests securing the Notes will be contractually deemed to rank
equally with the security interests that secure (but only to the extent
that such security is expressed to secure those
liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
PGE Loan and the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes,
(ii) certain obligations under hedging arrangements and (iii) certain
other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture
(including to the extent such indebtedness shares in these security
interests, future subordinated notes). Such security interests are, or
will be, evidenced by security documents for the benefit of (whether
directly or through the Security Agent) the holders of the Notes, the
holders of the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders under the
PGE Loan and/or the holders of certain other future senior or
subordinated indebtedness and obligations. Under the terms of the


20


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of
acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts
recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of
the Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay
indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE
Loan and certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a
super senior basis under the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, following the payment of fees and expenses
of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the
Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and
expenses of any other creditor representative of future senior or
subordinated indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture
to benefit from such security interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant security
unless instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement). The relevant Instructing Group or such
other class of creditors as specified by the Intercreditor Agreement
may, under certain conditions, be entitled to instruct the Security
Agent to enforce the relevant security subject to, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of
conflicting instructions, the Intercreditor Agreement will contain
provisions as to which set of instructions will prevail. See
“Description _of_ _certain_ _financing_ _arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

**Optional redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes on or after January
, 2022, at the redemption prices set forth under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Optional redemption,” plus accrued and_
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption.

Prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may on any one or more
occasions redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the
Notes issued under the Indenture (including the original principal
amount of any additional Notes), using the net proceeds from certain
equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the
principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
applicable date of redemption; provided that at least 50% of the
original principal amount of the Notes (including the original
principal amount of any additional Notes) issued under the Indenture
(excluding Notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) remains
outstanding after each such redemption.

.Prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including
the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in
each calendar year, commencing on the Issue Date, at a redemption
price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, up to the redemption
date. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional
redemption.”

In addition, prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or,
from time to time, part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus the applicable “makewhole” premium described in this Offering Memorandum and
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable date of redemption.


21


-----

**Additional amounts; Tax**
**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made by the Issuer or a Guarantor in respect of the
Notes or a Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction
for any taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction, except to the extent
required by law. If any such withholding or deduction is required by
law, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay additional amounts so that
the net amount received by holders of the Notes is no less than that
which would have been received in the absence of such withholding
or deduction. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Withholding taxes.” The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but_
not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, if, as a result of
certain changes in tax law the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor is or
would be required to pay additional amounts with respect to the
Notes. If the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must
pay a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Redemption for taxation
_reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Issuer experiences a change of control, the holders of the Notes
will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the
Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of such repurchase.
A change of control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if
a consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with
such event. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of
_control.”_

**Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture.

The Indenture will limit, among other things, the ability of the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer to:

                         - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                         - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                         - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                         - create or permit to exist certain security interests;

                         - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

                         - transfer, lease or sell certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

                         - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                         - amend certain documents; and

                         - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain covenants” and the related definitions._

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we
achieve investment-grade ratings and following a qualifying initial
public offering of the capital stock of any direct or indirect parent
entity of the Issuer. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain covenants—Suspension of covenants on achievement of_
_Investment Grade Status.”_

(1) Revenue organic growth and Adjusted EBITDA organic growth between two periods (N and N-1) are determined as follows:

   - In respect of acquisitions made in period N, by deducting, from the period N revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively, generated in period N by such acquisitions;

   - In respect of acquisitions made in period N-1, by deducting from the period N and period N-1 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA,
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, generated in period N and N-1 by such acquisitions; and

   - In respect of disposals, by deducting, from the period N and N-1 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, the revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA, respectively, generated by disposals made in period N and in period N-1.

From time to time we acquire, sell or close individual sites or businesses as part of our ongoing network management. These transactions
are considered not material over the historical period and are deemed to be part of organic growth.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA presented in this table excludes the impact of IFRS 16. See “Presentation of financial information and other data—
_Other financial measures.”_

(3) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue and is calculated on a consolidated basis and by
segment.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA (excluding Digital B2C) represents Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA—Digital B2C.

(5) Adjusted EBITDA margin (excluding Digital B2C) represents Adjusted EBITDA (excluding Digital B2C) as a percentage of revenue,
excluding Digital B2C revenue.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income from ordinary activities of the Parent Guarantor before depreciation/amortization
expense (as included in our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 and 2020), as adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain items we believe are non-recurring or otherwise not
reflective of the ongoing performance of our business, including start-up costs related to new businesses, income and expenses
attributable to the implementation of our transformation plan, fees paid to our shareholders and exceptional one-off expenses related to
professional conferences, and as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of IFRS 16. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe
it is a relevant measure for assessing performance and cash flows and thus aids in understanding our profitability for a given period. For a
description of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, see “Presentation of financial information and other data—
_Other financial measures.”_

Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 represents operating income from ordinary activities of the Parent Guarantor before depreciation/
amortization expense (as included in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 and 2020), as adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain items we believe are non-recurring or otherwise not
reflective of the ongoing performance of our business, including start-up costs related to new businesses, income and expenses
attributable to the implementation of our transformation plan, fees paid to our shareholders and exceptional one-off expenses related to
professional conferences without eliminating the impact of IFRS 16. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is a relevant
measure for assessing performance and cash flows and thus aids in understanding our profitability for a given period. For a description of
the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, see “Presentation of financial information and other data—Other financial
_measures.”_

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of the Parent Guarantor after giving pro forma effect to the
acquisitions made during the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, and related synergies and cost saving measures. Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA as presented herein differs from Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to realize all these purchasing and cost savings, and the costs we incur to realize these savings may be higher than
expected or may outweigh the benefits. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We may face challenges in integrating
_businesses that we have acquired or will acquire, and in expanding into new markets and may be unable to realize the expected_
_synergies and savings from these businesses or cost improvement initiatives we have taken.”_

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only. This information does not purport to represent what our
results of operations or other financial information would have been had the acquisitions made during the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020, occurred on April 1, 2019, or on any other date. These numbers have not been audited and are not derived from
accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS. For the limitations of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, see “Presentation of financial
_information and other data—Other financial measures.”_

(a) Represents the non-recurring start-up costs associated with launching our IDGARAGES.com website that only generates de minimis
revenue and is currently under testing, primarily made up of staff costs, IT development costs and marketing charges.

(b) Represents certain expenses, including legal fees, restructuring costs and advisory costs, in connection with the financial and capital
transformation of the Group. See “Summary—Our strengths—Finalize operational transformation to consolidate our leading position in
_the Trucks segment and increase our margins” for more information._

(c) Represents fees paid to intermediate holding companies to cover management, administrative, consulting, audit, and legal fees and
expenses, including in connection with our management incentive plan.

(d) Represents the portion of the expenses borne by the Group in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 for the organization of two
trade fairs that take place every four years.

(e) Represents a bonus received as part of the “prime Macron” program following the gilet jaunes strikes in France.

(f) For the year ended December 31, 2019, represents (a) the full year Adjusted EBITDA contribution of AD Bosch, which we acquired in
August 2019, as if this acquisition had closed on January 1, 2019 (€5.0 million), (b) the pro forma impact of the acquisition of Oscaro for
the year ended December 31, 2019 (€17.5 million), based on our estimate of the full year effect of the acquisition on our Adjusted
EBITDA—IFRS 16 (approximately €21 million), including the run-rate impact of our turnaround plan already completed (approximately
€7 million) and of additional cost optimization measures and purchasing synergies to be implemented (approximately €10 million) less
the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of Oscaro for the year ended December 31, 2019 already included in our Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS
16, and (c) the full year effect of synergies related to the acquisitions of Geevers (€1.0 million), Vervier Freins (€0.4 million) and AD
Bosch (€2.0 million).

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, represents (a) the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of AD Bosch for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2020, as if this acquisition had closed on April 1, 2019 (€2.8 million), (b) the pro forma impact of the acquisition of
Oscaro for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 (€15.1 million), based on our estimate of the full year effect of the acquisition on
our Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 (approximately €21 million), including the run-rate impact of our turnaround plan already completed
(approximately €7 million) and of additional cost optimization measures and purchasing synergies to be implemented (approximately
€10 million) less the contribution of Oscaro for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 already included in our Adjusted EBITDA—
IFRS 16, and (c) the full twelve-month effect of synergies related to the acquisitions of Geevers (€1.0 million), Vervier Freins (€0.4
million) and AD Bosch (€2.0 million).

The synergies reflected above primarily relate to: (i) purchasing synergies on supplier contracts negotiated by the Group, calculated on
the basis of the volume of purchases for the relevant period, and signed rebate rates following the acquisitions as if the renegotiated
contracts had been in place on the first day of such period; (ii) solely with respect to Oscaro, initiatives that we implemented as part of
our turnaround plan with respect to Oscaro, including (a) the rationalization of non-core entities through the concentrating and shutting
down non-core entities in non-core geographies and other normalization initiatives and (b) optimization measures (including supply
chain optimization, call center rationalization, overhead cost savings and footprint optimization); and (iii) solely with respect to AD
Bosch, purchasing synergies on contracts with suppliers of ISOTECH lubricants to the Group in order to replicate the better purchasing
conditions of AD Bosch on lubricants or, alternatively, by sourcing lubricants directly from Spain.

Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected synergies reflected above, no assurance can be given that such levels will be
achieved or that additional unanticipated costs will not arise to achieve these synergies. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of
assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in
estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates, including those described in
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We may face challenges in integrating businesses that we have acquired or will acquire,

_and in expanding into new markets and may be unable to realize the expected synergies and savings from these businesses or cost_
_improvement initiatives we have taken.”_

(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue and is calculated on a consolidated basis and by
segment and Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin represents Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 as a percentage of revenue and is calculated
on a consolidated basis and by segment.

(3) Change in working capital for a given period represents the change in inventories, trade payables, trade receivables and other receivables
and payables. See “—Consolidated change in working capital.”

(4) Capital expenditure consists solely of the acquisition of non-current assets. Adjusted capital expenditures exclude from capital
expenditure the one-off investments made in our new automated Logisteo platform. It is calculated as follows:

(6) Cash conversion is defined as net operating cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

(7) Pro forma net senior secured debt represents debt of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries that is secured by a senior ranking lien over
the Collateral, as of March 31, 2020, less cash and cash equivalents, as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing. See “Capitalization.”
Our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020, are higher than usual, due to various measures that we implemented following the
COVID-19 outbreak in order to maximize our liquidity, such as drawings on certain lines of credit, deferral of supplier payments and
working capital optimization. See “Recent Developments.” Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our net senior secured debt was
€856.7 million as of December 31, 2019, without giving effect to the Refinancing, and the ratio of our net senior secured debt to our Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, was 3.75x.

(8) Pro forma net financial debt represents total financial debt of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries excluding the effect of amortized
financing fees, the value of a put option held by minority shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries and the Contingent Value
Instruments, less cash and cash equivalents, as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing. See “Capitalization.” Our cash and cash
equivalents as of March 31, 2020, are higher than usual, due to various measures that we implemented following the COVID-19 outbreak
in order to maximize our liquidity, such as drawings on certain lines of credit, deferral of supplier payments and working capital
optimization. See “Recent Developments.” Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our net financial debt was €1,145.4 million as of December
31, 2019, without giving effect to the Refinancing, and the ratio of our net financial debt to our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2019, was 5.0x. Our ratio of pro forma net financial debt (excluding leases) as of March 31, 2020, to Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA would have been 4.0x.

(9) Pro forma net interest expense represents net interest expense of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020, as adjusted as if the Refinancing had been completed as set forth in “Use of proceeds” on April 1, 2019. Pro forma net
interest expense for the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries gives effect to the issuance of the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Fixed
Rate Notes Redemption and the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Redemption on or about the Issue Date, but does not
include any charges related to debt issuance costs in connection with the Offering. Pro forma net interest expense has been presented for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the issuance of the
Notes occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expenses for any future period or our financial condition at
any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to considering carefully, in light of the_
_circumstances and your individual investment objectives, the information contained elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum, you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in the Notes. If any of the_
_events described below actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be_
_materially adversely affected and, accordingly, the value and the trading price of the Notes may decline,_
_resulting in a loss of all or part of any investment in the Notes. The order in which the risk factors are presented_
_does not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude or significance of the individual_
_risk factor. Furthermore, the risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may_
_also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition._

**Risks related to our business**

**_Material disruptions to our supply chain or logistics platforms, in particular to our warehouses or_**
**_transportation network, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

As of December 31, 2019, our distribution network infrastructure in France was composed of our CPUs and
regional warehouses, connected to 33 wholly-owned distributors and 48 affiliated independent distributors
operating out of approximately 487 owned and affiliated distribution locations. Our light vehicle operations in
France are serviced by three logistics platforms: (i) Logisteo, our automated warehouse, (ii) ACR, focused on key
accounts and online customers and (iii) Cora, focused on light vehicle body parts for collision repair. Our light
vehicle operations in Benelux, Italy and Spain are serviced by five logistics platforms: Doyen Auto and Geevers
which cover Belgium and the Netherlands as well as certain online customers, OVAM/Ricauto and G-Group
which cover Italy and AD Bosch which covers Spain. Our Trucks segment is serviced by one logistics platform
called Bremstar. We rely on road transportation for the prompt transfer of the products that we distribute from
our warehouses or distribution sites directly to our customers.

A material disruption at any one of our warehouses or distribution sites or to our logistics platform or
transportation network caused, for example, by fire, weather-related problems, outbreaks of contagious diseases,
employee strikes, lock-outs and inadequacies in the transport infrastructure, or other events, could affect our
ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner or at all, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to
cover any damages that may arise or to compensate us for any losses that we may incur, due to such interruption
of our operations.

We also rely, directly and indirectly, upon independent third-party logistics providers to ship to us most of
our products from our suppliers and to transport products from our logistics platforms to our distribution
network. Our use of any logistics provider is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which could
increase our shipping and transportation costs. Strikes, work stoppages, mandatory quarantines, shelter-in-place
arrangements, government actions, facility closures and inclement weather may impact such logistics providers’
ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our needs. If we change our arrangements with, or lose
one of our important third-party logistics providers, we could face logistical difficulties that could materially
adversely affect our operations and could cause us to incur significant costs and expend resources in connection
with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the thirdparty logistics providers we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.

Since we distinguish ourselves on the basis of our superior delivery times (some of which are as short as a
few hours), any material disruption that lengthens delivery times to our customers could strain our relationships
with such customers and, as a result, may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and
reputation.

We are also exposed to an increase in transportation costs. In the year ended December 31, 2019,
transportation costs accounted for 5.1% of our revenue. Transportation costs have historically fluctuated
significantly over time, particularly in connection with oil prices. Increased transportation costs in turn could
result in reduced profits. Any disruption in transportation services, or any increases in the cost of transportation,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and_**
**_results of operations._**

Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the outbreak of COVID-19 or other diseases, may
result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many
countries, leading to substantial declines in consumer purchasing power and resulting in an economic downturn
that could affect demand for our products, our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and our
operating results. In particular, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 17, 2020, the French
government imposed a nationwide lockdown together with several other measures, which have had, among other
things, a material adverse impact on the overall French economy and our results of operations and financial
condition. As a result of these restrictive measures in France and in the other markets in which we operate, only a
select number of our sites remained open during the initial phase of the lockdown while we maintained a limited
number of employees in business-critical functions, and transitioned all of our eligible employees to remote
working or to the French temporary unemployment scheme (chômage partiel).

Even though the strict lockdown in France was lifted on May 11, 2020, significant restrictions and social
distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall French economy and, in turn,
our operations. The full impact of the lockdown on the French economy is not yet known. Similar measures
remain in place in the Benelux, Italy and Spain. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work
effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility
closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further materially
impacted. We may also be unable to perform fully on our contracts and carry out new sales activity, and some of
our costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.

In addition, as a result of social distancing measures and restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, our branded garages, Affiliated Distributors and customers may not be able to operate their businesses
for a prolonged and indeterminate period of time, which would likely impact our operations. Additionally, it is
possible that the continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection, or a renewed or extended lockdown,
if materialized, will cause further disruption in our business operations, cause delay, or limit the ability of,
garages, customers and suppliers to perform under their existing contracts, including making timely payments to
us, and cause other unpredictable events. Customers may experience significant losses due to the COVID-19
outbreak and may terminate their existing contracts or postpone or ultimately cancel future planned orders and
contracts due to those losses. Both domestic and international travel may be further restricted to certain areas
which may limit our ability to obtain new customers and enter new markets, to provide services in the areas in
which our customers are currently located or otherwise conduct our operations as we would do under normal
circumstances.

We are implementing enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules
and guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the
increase in costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an
increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement
such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result from any
COVID-19 pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into
contact with our operations. All or any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Our activities have been, and may in the future be, disrupted by restrictions imposed by governments or
other authorities to address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, or by changes in consumer behavior, which
may result in a loss of consumers for us and our garages and Affiliated Distributors, and our future rate of growth
may slow compared to the past. The general economic impacts of COVID-19 restrictions may result in
consumers driving less often and therefore not using our garages or Digital B2C services and solutions or
deciding to postpone, cancel or reduce spending on their vehicles. This could result in a reduction or delay in
revenue collection, which could impact our liquidity, cash flow and financial condition.

The disruptions triggered by COVID-19 in countries where our suppliers are located may also result in a
slow-down of their production activities and other disruptions, any of which could have a material impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.

In order to secure our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have entered into certain
government-backed loans in Italy and Belgium and into loans with certain commercial banks in Spain and the
Netherlands in May and June 2020. On July 1, 2020, we entered into the PGE Loan in France. Drawing under the

31


-----

PGE Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the publication of a decision (arreˆte´
_ministe´riel) by the French government to confirm the guarantee of the loan by the French State. We cannot_
guarantee that the French government will issue this arreˆte´ ministe´riel and that we will be able to draw on the
PGE Loan. If the business disruptions caused by COVID-19 last longer than we expect, we may continue to seek
other sources of liquidity, including additional government-backed loans in other countries in which we operate,
to the extent available, but there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or
available on favorable terms and in amounts sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness, or to
fund our other liquidity needs. Any deterioration in financial markets could impair our ability to obtain financing
in the future, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness to operate our ongoing operations, fund
liquidity needs or to refinance the Notes.

The outlook for the world economy following the outbreak of COVID-19 remains subject to unprecedented
uncertainty and such uncertainty may be prolonged in many of the markets in which we operate. The
International Monetary Fund predicts negative global growth in 2020 and many national governments have
instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. A renewed or future financial recession could
lead to an adverse impact on demand for our products and on our results of operations.

In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 outbreak by European Union institutions
as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for
the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of
European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions, the French
government and other governments of the countries in which we operate to contain the COVID-19 outbreak are
adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 outbreak will
be contained. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious
disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The extent to which the
COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects our business, results of operations and financial condition depends on
several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown
in the countries in which we operate, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and
operating conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where we operate, including France. Any future
developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and
actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the
COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects, as
well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening many of
the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

**_We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and are dependent on the ability of our third-_**
**_party suppliers to meet our product requirements._**

We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute. In 2019, we relied on approximately 260
third-party suppliers for the provision of light vehicle and truck spare parts, equipment and tools that are essential
to our business. We are currently implementing a supplier concentration strategy by which we have rationalized
our supplier relationships, reducing the number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260 in 2019,
which allows us to negotiate with a smaller group of suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top
ten suppliers accounted for approximately 50% of our products purchases by volume (as compared with 35% in
the year ended December 31, 2010), and our top supplier accounted for 12% of our products by volume.

Our business and, ultimately, our results of operations are dependent on our suppliers’ ability to provide us
with products. Our suppliers may fail to meet delivery deadlines, provide us with sufficient products or comply
with our quality requirements. The capacity of some of our suppliers to meet our supply requirements may in the
future be constrained at various times and our suppliers may be susceptible to production difficulties, insufficient
quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs or other factors that
negatively affect the quantity or quality of their production.

Production by one or more suppliers could be disrupted due to a variety of factors, including closures of one
of our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages,
fires, explosions, terrorist attacks, financial distress or bankruptcy, as well as political upheaval, adverse
economic events or logistical complications, shelter-in-place arrangements, facility closures, weather, natural
disasters, outbreaks of contagious diseases, border closures, delayed customs processing or other events. Any
short-term or prolonged disruption in the supply of spare parts from our suppliers could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the event that one or more of our major

32


-----

suppliers experiences operational or financial difficulties and we are unable to secure alternative sources in a
timely manner or on commercially beneficial terms, we may experience inventory shortages which could result
in unfilled customer orders and lost revenues due to our “just-in-time” delivery method, as well as damage to our
business reputation.

If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products under our presently agreed
terms, or if we are unable to obtain products from our suppliers in the future at favorable prices, our margins will
likely be negatively impacted and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. Moreover, if there is a significant or unexpected drop in customer demand or if there is a
significant increase in customer demand that we are unable to meet from our “on-hand” inventory stock or
procure in time from our suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

From time to time and in a limited number of cases, we have entered into agreements with, or provided
services to, certain suppliers that may not necessarily be formalized in writing or otherwise and may enter into
such agreements or provide such services in the future. In such circumstances, such suppliers could potentially
demand higher prices or more stringent payment terms or may break off the agreement with limited notice and
we may have no contractual remedy against such suppliers if we suffer economic loss as a result of their actions.
Our ability to ensure continuity of supply from such suppliers might also be limited.

**_Our business is exposed to risks associated with economic and other conditions in the global economy and in_**
**_particular in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain._**

The demand for certain of the products that we distribute may be impacted by the condition of the global
economy and in particular by economic conditions in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain. Global economic
conditions have deteriorated over recent months due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The light vehicle spare parts
aftermarket tends to be affected in the early period of an economic recession, when end-customers delay the
maintenance of their light vehicles. The truck spare parts aftermarket is more cyclical than the light vehicle spare
parts aftermarket, due to the correlation of the demand for road freight with general economic conditions.
Simultaneously, de-stocking occurs at all levels of the spare parts supply chain, which may cause short- to
medium-term decreases in sales by distributors of light vehicle and truck spare parts. France is our principal
geographic market, representing 74% of our revenue and 77% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2019. We also operate in Benelux, Italy and Spain and our Light Vehicle International segment
represented 26% of our revenue and 23% of our Adjusted EBITDA over the same period. The outlook for the
world economy remains subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
which may lead to prolonged periods of economic uncertainty in our main markets, especially France. See also
“Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and
_results of operations.” Such uncertainty could decrease consumer confidence and consumer and business_
expenditures on vehicle maintenance, or less frequent visits by our customers to our garages, which could have
an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We cannot predict the timing or duration of any economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a
subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in the geographies in which we operate. If the light vehicle and
truck spare parts aftermarket significantly deteriorates due to economic conditions, we could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continued uncertainty in global economic
conditions (particularly in the Eurozone) also poses a risk to our existing contractual arrangements and the
fulfillment of obligations by us, our product suppliers or our customers. If the current economic situation
deteriorates significantly or if one or more Eurozone countries were to depart from the euro, our business could
be materially adversely impacted.

We are also subject to the risk of increased costs due to general economic conditions, both in forms of
increased employee costs and increased operational costs. Any failure to pass such increases in costs on to our
customers could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, our business and financial results may be adversely affected by factors and conditions that
negatively affect the frequency with which our customers visit our garages, such as terrorism, social unrest,
outbreaks of contagious diseases and political instability. We cannot accurately foresee the extent to which such
events may affect our business, directly or indirectly, in the future and cannot assure investors that we will
choose or be able to obtain insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts or certain other events
and any losses that could result from these events. An actual or perceived terror threat, health emergency, social
unrest or internal instability in France or in our other markets may negatively affect the frequency of our

33


-----

customers’ visits to our garages, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operation.

Additionally, if there is a disruption at our warehouses (particularly at our key automated warehouse,
Logisteo) or branded garages, an interruption in our supply and logistics chain and/or suppliers are unable to
manufacture or deliver our products due to such catastrophic events, our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_Our growth strategy will require us to expand and improve our operations, and risks associated with our_**
**_expansion plans may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our growth strategy includes, among others, strengthening our market position in France, Benelux, Italy and
Spain and expanding into new geographical markets that offer logistics and purchasing synergies with our
existing operations. We may implement this strategy through organic growth, diversifying our activities or
selected acquisitions, such as the recent acquisition of Oscaro and a majority stake in AD Bosch and future
acquisitions in adjacent geographies. Acquisitions pose additional risks, including paying too high a purchase
price, the assumption of unexpected liabilities and the impact of a change of control on the acquired business
including with respect to contracts and financing agreements. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic
acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds
necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. In addition, the integration of
an acquired business and our systems, operations and personnel, particularly in respect of businesses operating in
adjacent markets, could be more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, which could lead to increased
operating costs, the loss of key employees and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated operating savings.
Our failure to identify suitable acquisition opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business. In the near
term, we also expect the impact of COVID-19, and our desire to manage our expenditures during the pandemic,
to limit the number of acquisitions we make.

Our logistics complexity will increase as our footprint grows. This increased complexity will require that we
continue to expand and improve our capabilities, including our IT and other logistics management capabilities, as
well as to grow, train and manage our employee base. We will also need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our
information and distribution systems, controls and procedures related to financial reporting. Implementing new
systems, controls and procedures and any changes to existing systems, controls and procedures could present
challenges that we do not anticipate and which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, this increased complexity will require us to continually evaluate whether personnel
with appropriate levels of expertise and experience are properly allocated in accordance with our growth strategy,
and any failure to allocate such personnel may make it more difficult to achieve our growth strategy.

Our growth could also make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will need to make in
the future. This growth could impact the operational flexibility and reactivity of our supply chain and make us
unable to react as promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends as we have been able to do
historically. We may not be able to anticipate all of the demands that our expanding operations will impose on
our business, personnel, systems, controls and procedures, and our failure to appropriately address such demands
could materially adversely impact our existing operations and prevent us from implementing our growth strategy.

**_We may face challenges in integrating businesses that we have acquired or will acquire, and in expanding into_**
**_new markets and may be unable to realize the expected synergies and savings from these businesses or cost_**
**_improvement initiatives we have taken._**

In the past, we have occasionally acquired businesses in order to expand our operations. For example, in
2018, we acquired a leading independent retailer of multi-brand car body parts in Benelux (Geevers), an
independent spare parts distributor in Italy (G-Group), a multi-brand distributor of car body parts in Belgium
(Verviers Freins) and an online distributor of light vehicle spare parts in France (Oscaro) and in 2019, we
acquired a majority stake in an independent spare parts distributor in Spain (AD Bosch). We could face
significant challenges in managing and integrating an acquired business into our business. The process of
integration can be more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, leading to increased operating costs, the
loss of key employees and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated synergies and operating savings, which
can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses or any future potential acquisition within a
reasonable time following our acquisition, we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits
thereof. In connection with the integration of recently-acquired businesses or integrating any future potential

34


-----

acquisition into our existing operating structure, we will seek to realize purchasing and cost savings. For
example, we often acquire targets, in part with the expectation that we would be able to integrate into our
business the performance of their distribution networks, improve their operating results and realize purchasing
and cost savings, particularly in the areas of procurement. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to fully
integrate operations of past and future acquired businesses into our business, or at all, or that we will be in a
position to realize some or all synergies and purchasing and cost savings when we acquire such targets. To
achieve any of the foregoing, we could also be required to make additional capital expenditures which may be
significant. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement these
measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve the planned cost savings
is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If one or more of
our underlying assumptions regarding these projects proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to
substantially higher costs than planned, and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time
frame, the expected benefits from our cost measures. Furthermore, pricing pressure from our customers or
competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the benefits of the cost measures that we have assumed
that we will be able to implement. Also, cost efficiencies from expected improved logistics and distribution
processes may not be sustainable due to changes in customer needs, environmental law, logistics, transportation
costs or other cost variables.

In addition, our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of key
customers and suppliers. Our inability to realize the anticipated purchasing and cost savings and revenue
enhancements from an acquisition and other measures that we have taken could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In the future, we may acquire businesses or undertake investments or reorganizations in a targeted manner.
There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to identify suitable businesses or investment
opportunities and be able to acquire, or make the investment, on favorable terms. There is also a risk that not all
material risks in connection with the acquisition of a company or the making of investments have been identified
in the due diligence process and may not, therefore, be taken into account when deciding whether to acquire the
business or make the investment. These risks may materialize only after a company has been acquired or an
investment has been made, and may not be covered by the warranties in the related agreements or by insurance
policies.

In addition, expansion into new markets, such as our expansion in the Spanish market through the
acquisition of AD Bosch, entails greater risks than we face in our existing markets and such risks may be
inherently higher if the expansion is made through acquisitions, due to the risks related to integrating acquired
businesses. New markets may have different competitive and market conditions, customer preferences and
discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. In particular, expansion into new geographic markets
exposes us to risks related to cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as risks related to navigating different legal
and regulatory environments. We may also face a higher cost of entry, logistics difficulties and minimal
operating experience in such territories. Our product and service offering may not be successful in new markets
and our costs may increase due to cost overruns, unexpected delays or other unforeseen factors. Additionally, we
may not be successful in our efforts to integrate new locations (regardless of whether they are the result of
organic growth or of acquisitions) into our network. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Financial difficulties of our customers may require us to write off debts._**

Across each of our business lines, we rely on the ability of our customers to pay for the products that we
distribute. If an affiliated independent distributor or other customer undergoes financial difficulties, payments
can be significantly delayed and, ultimately, we may not be able to collect amounts payable to us under our
agreements, resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past
due. There can be no assurance, however, that such reserves are sufficiently large for the credit risks we face,
particularly in relation to our affiliated independent distributors. Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts
would adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our industry is highly competitive._**

We operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from a variety of types of spare parts
distributors and sellers in the highly fragmented Western European spare parts aftermarket, which comprises
Benelux, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and does not include the UK. We primarily compete on the basis of

35


-----

product availability, delivery lead time, quality of service, product range and technical support. Our main
competitors are other light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors in France (such as Groupauto), Benelux
(such as LKQ) and Italy (such as LKQ), as well as new online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors
(such as eurocarparts.com and autopm24.eu), which mainly compete with us on the basis of price. We believe
that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the internet before making a purchase and generally
choose products with the most competitive price.

Over time, online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors may adopt our B2B distribution and
logistics model, reduce costs and demand lower prices for the spare parts they sell. Furthermore, in certain
countries, low-cost discount distributors have emerged that primarily compete on the basis of price and offer
lower prices for the spare parts that they sell, and such low-cost discount distributors may decide to enter the
French or one or more of our main markets. In addition, our competitors that currently purchase spare parts from
suppliers on a decentralized basis may consolidate their purchasing functions across their various operations,
subsidiaries or owned or Affiliated Distributors, and their purchasing scale may enable them to purchase spare
parts at prices that are lower than we can obtain. As a result, they may be able to offer certain spare parts to
customers at lower prices than we can. Our failure to adapt to these or other changes in the competitive landscape
could result in a low profit margin, decreased revenue and loss of market share and could therefore have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our customers also compete with spare parts suppliers and manufacturers (such as Bosch, Faurecia, KnorrBremse and Valeo) and branded spare parts manufacturers (such as Peugeot, Fiat, Volkswagen and Renault,
including their affiliated dealers). Car dealers typically specialize in light vehicles and trucks aged zero to four
years old and capture a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties. Certain car dealers,
however, have extended their new light vehicle warranties to up to eight years, and provide for long-term service
programs to customers. If light vehicle and truck manufacturers continue to significantly expand (for example, as
a result of changes in the legal environment) the scope of their warranties beyond the current limits, especially
for replacement parts and maintenance items, these replacements and maintenance parts covered by such
extended warranties would likely be performed by car dealers instead of us. Additionally, car manufacturers such
as Peugeot are increasingly relying on their own logistics platforms to distribute light vehicle and truck spare
parts even outside the usual warranty periods and for all vehicle brands and types, which could reduce our market
share in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In addition, we may face more intense competition in the future if competitors adopt aggressive pricing
policies, expand their distribution networks, undertake more extensive marketing and advertising campaigns,
offer more appealing products or adapt more quickly to changes in customer preferences and trends. We may
also face competition from generalist online players entering or already present on the spare parts distribution
business. Certain of our competitors may possess greater financial resources, newer or better technology and
materials, larger purchasing economies of scale and/or lower cost bases, integrated manufacturing capabilities,
stronger name recognition and/or entrenched relationships with suppliers, any of which may give them a
competitive advantage over us and could result in a loss of our market share.

**_Our sales depend on the age, condition, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks used in France,_**
**_Benelux, Italy and Spain and the length of service intervals._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by the age, condition, number and mileage of
light vehicles and trucks used in France and other markets in which we operate, and the length of service
intervals in those markets. We consider our core market to be light vehicles and trucks aged over four years. As
light vehicles and trucks get older, expenses for light vehicle and truck spare parts generally increase. A decline
in the age of light vehicles and trucks could lead to decreased demand for the products that we distribute and our
services.

A decline in the use of light vehicles could result in a related decrease in demand for light vehicle spare
parts. Factors such as higher gasoline prices or gasoline taxes, a significant deterioration in economic conditions,
environmental concerns or limitations on tax breaks for commuting costs and the introduction of a road charge
for light vehicles and trucks and potential speed limits and certain vehicle bans in cities could reduce light
vehicle and truck spending. Similarly, changes in traveling or commuting behavior (for example, through the
increased use of public transport or light vehicle sharing) or continuing urbanization could decrease the average
mileage of light vehicles and demand for the products that we distribute and our services. Such a decline in
demand could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

36


-----

The condition of vehicles could also impact demand for our products and services, with lower-quality
vehicles requiring more frequent and more costly maintenance and repairs, while more expensive vehicles may
require more expensive replacement parts. The size of the car parc or truck fleet is also a demand driver. The
number of vehicles in use is a function of new vehicle sales and vehicle scrappage rates and a steady or growing
total vehicle population supports continued demand for maintenance and repair. Finally, average annual mileage
of vehicles in the car parc or truck fleet impacts demand for our products and services because higher mileage,
like vehicle age, increases the need for maintenance and replacement.

A decrease in the average age of the car parc or truck fleet, driven by increased purchases of new light
vehicles and trucks, could lead to decreased demand in the short-term for our products and services, although
such purchases would also increase the size of the car parc or truck fleet, potentially stimulating demand for our
products and services on the mid- to long-term. For example, the French government is currently developing
incentives for drivers that are intended to phase out older, polluting vehicles. The outcomes of these efforts are
not yet known but could lead in the short-term to decreases in the size of the older car parc if drivers choose to
scrap older vehicles and replace them with new vehicles. Likewise, a decline in the number of, or mileage on,
light vehicles and trucks and in our addressable spare parts aftermarket could lead to decreased demand for the
products that we distribute and our services.

We believe that light vehicle and truck repairs are currently being made at a later date and to a lesser extent.
The technological and qualitative improvements of many light vehicle and truck components can lead to a
decrease in demand for light vehicle and truck spare parts, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may fail to successfully anticipate demand or manage our inventory and services commensurate with such_**
**_demand._**

One of the key parameters of our business is operational efficiency in general and inventory management in
particular. If orders and inventory do not efficiently match demand at any particular time and location, either in
terms of the quantity or nature of products, we could have higher or lower than anticipated inventory levels,
which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results. For example, if products remain
unsold, we may need to reduce selling prices, resulting in lower margins, or may need to incur higher charges to
store inventory or transport it to other markets within our network where there may be greater demand. We may
also be required to incur further inventory depreciation. Conversely, if we fail to stock sufficient quantities of
high- selling products or cannot provide in-demand services, we could lose sales and our reputation with
customers could be damaged. Furthermore, we may not be able to appropriately respond to the preferences of
customers in markets outside France, our original market, where customers could have different needs than
French customers. If we are unable to appropriately align our inventory and services with consumer demand, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_Disruptions in our IT systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We depend on the timely implementation and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network,
websites, ordering platforms, call centers and other IT systems, including those which may be provided by third
parties or which may be hosted online or in the “cloud” for the smooth functioning of our operations, and in
particular with respect to Oscaro. The various software we use and develop in collaboration with third-party
software companies facilitates our ability to efficiently manage supply flows, operational data and other
management and financial information, and to provide management with current inventory levels at our
warehouses. In particular, our customized IT systems allow us to identify, in real time, the availability of any
particular product that is ordered within our distribution network. We depend on the continuous availability and
reliability of our IT platform, which, in turn, depends on the functioning of our IT hardware and is, therefore,
subject to operational risks such as the occurrence of equipment failures, power interruptions and unlawful
conduct by third parties. The performance of our IT systems also depends, among other things, on our ability to
effectively safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage from interruptions to
telecommunication services, data breaches (including breaches that result in the theft or compromise of customer
data), hacking and phishing attempts and the introduction of malware and computer viruses. The occurrence of
any such events, and any consequent slowdown or interruption to telecommunication services, may impair our
ability to manage supply flows, operational data and other management and financial information and to provide
management with current inventory levels at our warehouse, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

37


-----

For example, we have upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT management system of our
light vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage our inventory more efficiently. The upgrade of our
existing IT systems or the implementation of new IT systems may cause organizational disruptions within our
business. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new warehouse IT management system, or any future IT
systems, will deliver the projected efficiencies.

One of our strategies is to increase sales of products that we distribute through our websites. The
implementation of this strategy will require additional IT resources and may result in a disruption to our existing
computer and telecommunications systems, whether in connection with the implementation of expanded
capabilities or otherwise, which could, in turn, adversely affect our online sales and/or our business reputation.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain and upgrade our IT systems in a manner that will avoid
interruptions or disruptions of such systems. Any failure or inability to maintain and upgrade our IT systems may
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We rely on software and information systems licensed from third parties and any failure or interruption in_**
**_products or services provided by these third parties and inability to replace them adequately could harm our_**
**_ability to operate our business._**

Our information technology systems, including key business automation systems and applications used in
reporting and analysis for business planning have been licensed from third parties. We rely on the applicable
licensor to provide maintenance, technical support and periodic upgrades so that the relevant system or
application can continue to support our business. If we or these developers fail to maintain and upgrade these
information systems and software programs, the efficiency of our operations could be disrupted or reduced
partially if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, which could in turn
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Continued technological advancements in light vehicle and truck parts could affect our sales._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by technological and qualitative improvements in
new light vehicles and trucks, and the light vehicle and truck market is characterized by frequent technical
advances, automation and increases in the complexity of existing components. Certain light vehicle and truck
spare parts may feature complex or innovative technology that can only be maintained by persons with special
training or at specialized garages. Our success depends in large part on our ability to access, follow, interpret and
react to changing technological and qualitative specifications in an appropriate and timely manner. Our products
and services must be adapted to the technological needs of a broad range of customers, which may not be
foreseeable with certainty and are subject to change.

In order to efficiently develop our products and services, we need to access new and detailed information on
new light vehicles and trucks provided by light vehicle and truck manufacturers. If such manufacturers were to
refuse to provide appropriate and timely access to such information, or if a new regulation were to limit access to
such information, we would be unable to efficiently develop our products and services, which would have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

New light vehicle technology may also require continuous training and regular updating in relation to a
particular light vehicle or truck model. For example, repairs of sensors as well as repairs of air conditioning
systems require special skills, training and equipment. The independent garages that are the primary end-users of
the parts we distribute may not continue to obtain the information and training necessary to maintain the complex
technology featured in our end-customers’ vehicles, and the expertise to install and repair these parts may only be
available at car dealers. Moreover, the expenses required for specialized staff training as well as the sophisticated
equipment required to test and repair these evolving components could result in higher costs or higher capital
expenditure for us or for our end-customers. In certain cases, it may no longer be economically feasible for
independent garages to offer repair services for particular light vehicle and truck models or spare parts.
Furthermore, sophisticated manufacturing technology for light vehicle and truck spare parts improves their
quality and reduces the number of replacements and repairs they require. If light vehicle and truck spare parts are
replaced less frequently, our revenue could decrease.

The IAM in which we operate differs from the OEM, in which operators are linked to the light vehicle
manufacturers who directly supply them with the necessary technical information on vehicle components and
repair procedures. Due to ongoing technological developments in the manufacturing of light vehicles and trucks,
independent garages need to develop appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components. The failure
of independent garages to develop the appropriate technical expertise, or access to the tools, instruments and

38


-----

parts that such technological developments demand, may result in an increase in demand for maintenance and
repair services provided by car dealers with the necessary technical expertise (which garages represent a small
portion of our revenues), which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Our business depends in part on a strong brand image and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our_**
**_brand or market our product offerings we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers or sell_**
**_sufficient quantities of the products that we distribute._**

We believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our
business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands are integral to the success of our
business and to the implementation of our growth strategy. This will require us to make further investments in
areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as our website operations. For example, we have developed
websites for each of our distributors and garages and we invest in large customer events, such as an event to
develop our brand that we organized in September 2018. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will
depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, and our ability to provide good
customer experiences. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our
public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Our brand image may also be diminished if
we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient delivery of quality products, if
we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities, if we fail to
comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or
reputation. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we distributed products to
approximately 3,673 branded garages and 84 distributors, including 31 wholly-owned distributors and 53
Affiliated Distributors. We have entered into a master affiliation agreement with all of our affiliated independent
distributors, which is renewed every seven years, and we enter into agreements with each of our light vehicle
branded garages, which are renewed annually. These branded garages and affiliated independent distributors,
which we do not control, may take actions or make decisions that adversely affect our brand and reputation.

Our principal brand names and trademarks, such as Autodistribution, Doyen, Garage Expert AD, Mondial
Pare-Brise, Auto Primo, Autossimo, Truckissimo, AD Poids Lourds and ISOTECH, the “AD” logo, and since the
Doyen Auto Acquisition, 1,2,3 AutoService, Requal and API, and since the acquisitions of G-Group and Oscaro,
the Xenergy and Oscaro brands, respectively, are key assets of our business. See “Business—Information
_technology—Intellectual property.” We are not aware of any material violations or infringements of our_
intellectual property rights as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. However, there is no assurance that third
parties will not infringe our intellectual property rights in the future in ways that will have negative repercussions
on our reputation, business and results of operations or that measures taken by us will be effective in protecting
our intellectual property rights. In the event that third parties unlawfully infringe on our intellectual property
rights, we may face considerable difficulties and costly litigation in order to fully protect our intellectual property
rights, which may in turn materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and prospects.

Third parties have in the past and may in the future assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly
as we expand our business to include new products and product categories and moves into other geographic
markets. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming, and could
divert management attention. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary
liability and prevent us from distributing certain products or employing certain brand names and trademarks. In
addition, the resolution of claims may require us to abandon or redesign our products or branding materials,
acquire license rights from third parties or cease using those rights altogether, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect our intellectual
property rights, but we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken or will take in the future will be
adequate to prevent any violation or challenges to our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that
litigation will not be necessary in order to enforce our trademark or other intellectual property rights or to defend
ourselves against third-party claims of infringement of their rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other
factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brands and trademarks, which could, in turn, lead to
decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our marketing and communications strategy may prove ineffective._**

Our advertising and marketing expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, were €15.8 million, and
consisted primarily of online marketing and promotional campaigns for certain of our products. We will continue
to invest in such marketing initiatives, particularly through our websites. Our branded garages and Mondial PareBrise, Doyen Auto and Oscaro also engage in their own marketing campaigns. The results of these investments
may be unsuccessful or fail to provide sufficient return on investment. Our failure to implement our marketing
initiatives, or their failure to increase revenue, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of
operations and financial position and on the implementation of our growth strategy.

**_If our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations, our_**
**_brands and reputation may be damaged._**

While our operating guidelines promote ethical business practices such as environmental responsibility, fair
wage practices and compliance with child labor laws, among others, through commitments in suppliers’ contracts
to apply our ethical charter, we do not control our third-party suppliers or their business practices and our
contractual remedies with respect to supplier practices are limited. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that
suppliers will comply with our guidelines. As a result, from time to time our suppliers or manufacturers may not
be in compliance with local labor law or recognized ethical or environmental standards, among other things. A
lack of compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in
delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions to our operations. Violation of antimoney laundering, bribery, environmental or labor or other laws by our third-party suppliers or the divergence of
a third-party supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the European Union
could also lead to liability and attract negative publicity on our business and harm the integrity of our brands.
Any incident calling into question the integrity of our suppliers and their business practices could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and our insurance premiums may increase_**
**_substantially._**

We carry various types of insurance that cover the risks associated with the ordinary operation of our
business, including general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, fleet, IT, property and workers’
compensation insurance. Given the diversity of locations and settings in which we distribute our products and
provide services and the range of activities our employees and us engage in, we may not always be able to
accurately foresee all activities and situations in order to ensure full coverage by the terms of our insurance
policies and as a result, we may not be covered by insurance in specific instances. While we seek to maintain
appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable and we may experience major incidents of a nature
not covered, in whole or in part, by insurance. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events resulting in
substantial claims for damages in a calendar year may lead to increases in our insurance premiums and our
insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or material
price increases in the insurance market in general. We may not be able to maintain our current insurance
coverage or do so at a reasonable cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Our lease obligations may limit our operating flexibility._**

We lease most of our locations from third-party landlords. In order to optimize our real estate portfolio and
respond to changes in demographics or other conditions at specific locations, we may seek to exit certain leases
at regular intervals and obtain new leases in new locations that provide similar flexibility. Our ability to negotiate
lease terminations or modifications on acceptable terms or at all may be limited. For example, in France,
commercial leases generally provide for a minimum nine-year term, with breakpoints at the end of each threeyear period, and include strict termination and renewal provisions, including the possibility of a rent increase if
the lease is renewed after the initial nine-year term. If we are unable to terminate the leases of locations that are
no longer consistent with our strategy, we may incur expenses in relation to the termination of such leases. In
addition, third-party landlords may also seek to terminate certain of our leases, which may require us to relocate
some of our operations. If we cannot terminate leases for unprofitable or vacant locations, or if the termination or
modification of leases results in significant costs, our business, results of operations and financial condition may
be materially adversely affected.

**_We risk the theft or the misappropriation of funds and products in our warehouses and other facilities._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to the risk of theft of products in our warehouses and
other facilities. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not incur any losses due to the theft of products in
our facilities. Products may also be misappropriated during transportation. We carry no insurance for the theft of
our products. Occasionally, our locations may be the targets of successful or unsuccessful robbery attempts by
third parties. We may also from time to time experience a misappropriation of funds in our facilities or at other
levels of our business. Any such theft or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

**_The products that we provide may be exposed to price and margin pressures, and we may be unable to attract_**
**_new customers and retain existing customers at competitive pricing and margin levels._**

We may be forced to decrease prices for the products that we distribute due to a number of factors, such as
challenging macroeconomic conditions or increased competition. In our industry, both light vehicle and truck
spare parts manufacturers set retail prices through official recommended prices for the end-customer. Each
participant in the value chain, including us, then sets our prices as a percentage of the recommended price on the
basis of our targeted gross margin. We may be unable to compensate for a decrease in recommended retail prices
by obtaining supplier rebates, attracting new business, reducing our operating costs (for example, through
headcount reductions, increases in labor productivity or other gains in cost efficiency) or otherwise, which could
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Price and margin pressures
may therefore lead to a reduction in average prices and margins for our services, which could also have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A decrease in the number of affiliated independent distributors in our network or a decrease in demand for_**
**_certain key spare parts may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our principal customers are light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors and professional garages. We
entered into affiliation agreements with 32 affiliated independent light vehicle spare parts distributors in France
as of December 31, 2019. These agreements allow these affiliated independent distributors to use the
Autodistribution brand and to benefit from commercial conditions we negotiate with our suppliers and from
loyalty bonuses. We renewed our agreements with our affiliated independent distributors on April 13, 2015, for a
further seven years. We also entered into agreements with 3,673 branded garages in France as of December 31,
2019. These agreements allow branded garages to use one of our brands, including Garage AD, Garage AD
Expert, Auto Primo, 1,2,3 AutoService, Requal and API, and in return the independent garages designate our
distributors as their preferred distributors and are eligible for certain rebates. If any of these distributors or
garages were to breach their agreements with us by prematurely terminating their relationship with us, the size of
our distribution network and our customer base could be reduced and our profitability significantly harmed as a
result.

In addition, our customers mostly purchase light vehicle and truck spare parts based on their existing needs,
but are not required to purchase a minimum amount of any of the products that we distribute. Therefore, a
significant decrease in demand for certain key spare parts for both light vehicles and trucks could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that we do not
maintain our existing level of business with our customers, we will need to attract new customers or win new
business with our existing customers and if we are unable to do so, our business, results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.

**_We are dependent on our network of distributors and our branded garages and our revenue may decrease if_**
**_our distributors and branded garages do not generate sufficient sales or if our relationships with our branded_**
**_garages deteriorate._**

Our business is organized around CPUs, which buy aftermarket spare parts and equipment and tools from
our suppliers, which are then sold to our local wholly-owned distributors (“wholly-owned distributors”),
affiliated independent distributors and online retailers. These distributors then sell these parts, equipment and
tools to garages, some of which are affiliated with us and operate under our brands. Our revenue depends on the
ability of our distributors and branded garages to generate sales and our overall success is dependent on our
ability to maintain our relationships with them and further grow our network. Our revenue is dependent on the
sales of such distributors and, in turn, those of the branded garages, and the quality of the relationship we have
with them. Any deterioration in these sales or relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

41


-----

We occasionally terminate or choose not to renew our relationships with certain of our branded garages and,
from time to time, certain branded garages may terminate or choose not to renew their relationships with us. Such
terminations or non-renewals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition in the future. However, there is no guarantee that the historically low rates of such
terminations will continue in the future. Furthermore, we may not be successful in replacing or offsetting any
such terminated or non-renewed branded garage relationships with new or expanded branded garage relationships
in the future, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_The departure of members of our management team or other key personnel, or our inability to attract and_**
**_retain qualified management or other key personnel, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

Our success is largely dependent upon the continued service and skills of our existing management team. If
one or more of our executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present
positions, we may not be able to replace them easily and our business may be disrupted, which may materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Competition for management and
key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited, so we may not be able to attract and
retain experienced executive or key personnel in the future, which could hinder our ability to run and develop our
business successfully. In addition, if any of our executives or other key personnel joins a competitor or forms a
competing company, we may lose customers, know-how and other key personnel, which may have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and employment, and_**
**_changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our business, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to
labor, employment, health and safety. The modification, suspension, repeal or expiration of favorable provisions
in labor and employment laws and regulations or, conversely, any increases of mandatory minimum wages
pursuant to laws, regulations or collective bargaining agreements, or of social security contributions, may
negatively impact our business and profitability.

Any unfavorable changes in labor and employment laws and regulations, or in the terms of collective
bargaining agreements applicable to our business, as well as any increases of the statutory minimum wage in any
country or industry in which we operate, may increase our payroll costs and negatively affect our operating
margins and operational flexibility, and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, the impact of laws and regulations, particularly labor and
employment laws and regulations, may restrict our ability to achieve cost reductions and other efficiency gains.

Labor market reform in general continues to be a key policy measure on the French government’s political
agenda, and changes in any of the above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws
or regulations could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_French and foreign tax legislation, tax audits or disputes and our results may restrict our ability to use French_**
**_tax loss carry-forwards._**

We may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from
discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss carryforwards from our subsidiaries. The actual realization of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and
regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities. In particular,
pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French tax code (Code général des impôts) (the “French Tax
Code”), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset taxable profits with respect to a
given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of the taxable profit exceeding €1 million.
Similar rules apply to tax losses generated by French tax consolidated groups. As of December 31, 2019, we had
recorded tax loss carry-forwards notably in France. The French tax loss carry-forwards have been reflected in our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in the amount of €101.8 million of deferred
tax assets corresponding to the portion of tax loss carry-forwards that we expect to offset against operating
profits in the following fiscal years. Any reduction in our ability to use these tax assets due to changes in laws

42


-----

and regulations, potential tax reassessment or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A failure to meet our labor needs, a deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions or a_**
**_failure to extend, renew or renegotiate on favorable terms our collective bargaining agreements could have an_**
**_adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

As of December 31, 2019, we had 7,347 employees. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling
labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel
in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health
and other insurance costs, union membership levels and activity among our employees and changes in
employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. Likewise, maintaining good relationships with our
employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result, a failure to meet
our labor needs or any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other employee
representatives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See
“Business—Employees.”

Some of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining agreements. These agreements
typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other things, the general working
conditions of our employees such as maximum working hours, holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and
incentives. National collective bargaining agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions
that could affect our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees. We may not be
able to extend existing company-specific agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the expiration
of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or without work stoppages,
strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also become subject to additional company-specific agreements or
amendments to the existing national collective bargaining agreements. Such additional company-specific
agreements or amendments may increase our operating costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

While in the last three years we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as a result of
strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes, such events could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of
reputation, increased wages and benefits, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Additionally, national collective bargaining agreements and company-specific agreements often contain
provisions that could limit our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees, which
could limit our ability to execute our strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Increased employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our labor costs may rise faster than expected in the future as a result of a larger workforce, salary increases
and headcount increases. We may be unable to offset the increase in labor costs through increased selling prices
or productivity gains. In recent years, we have benefited from government programs in certain European
countries designed to favor employment, including recent labor reforms that effectively reduce the costs
associated with hiring new employees. There can be no assurance that such programs will continue or that we
will continue to benefit from such programs and that labor costs will not increase as a result. More recently,
during the COVID-19 pandemic, we benefited from government furlough schemes in certain European countries
such as France, where the French temporary unemployment scheme (chômage partiel) allowed us to decrease our
labor costs during the lockdown period. There can be no assurance that a similar scheme will apply in the event
of another lockdown in France. If labor costs increase further, our operating costs will also increase, which could,
if we are unable to recover these cost increases from our customers through increased selling prices or offset such
cost increases through labor productivity gains or other measures, have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Employment, environmental, health and safety regulations relating to our operations could subject us to_**
**_increasing costs or fines._**

Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of European directives and regulations, national,
state and local laws, rules, taxes and regulations relating to the protection of employees, the environment,

43


-----

workers’ health and safety, and the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and
other regulated materials. These include, in particular, requirements governing employee hours, the disposal of
used oil, batteries, tires and other materials processed in our recycling business. These laws, rules and regulations
may affect the way in which we conduct our operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could
lead to fines and other penalties as well as negative publicity which could damage our brands and reputation. In
addition, various environmental laws also may make us liable for the costs of cleaning up and responding to
hazardous substances that may have been released on our properties, including releases unknown that are
unknown to us. These environmental laws and regulations also could require us to pay for environmental
remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we have disposed of or recycled hazardous
substances. With environmental regulations becoming increasingly stringent, the cost of complying with the
various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could materially adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to fluctuation, which could have an adverse_**
**_effect on our financial condition._**

Our working capital requirements and cash flows have historically been, and are expected to continue to be,
subject to seasonal and yearly fluctuations, depending on a number of factors. Factors that could result in cash
flow fluctuations include the level of sales and the related margins of those sales, the collection of receivables,
the timing and size of purchases of inventories and related components, the timing of payments for such
purchases, and the terms and timing of payments for payables and accrued liabilities, as well as prevailing
economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are
unable to manage fluctuations in working capital requirements and cash flow, our business, results of operations
and financial condition may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to make required interest
payments on our indebtedness.

If our working capital requirements exceed our other cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash
balances and availability for borrowings under our financing arrangements to satisfy those needs, as well as
potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds,
including under our Revolving Credit Facility, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital
requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow sufficient funds to
meet our working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures,
refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to sell assets or equity or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty or recall claims that may_**
**_be brought against us._**

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the products that we sell,
particularly the truck spare parts we sell, actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our
product results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. Accordingly, we could
experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these
claims. In addition, if any of the products that we distribute are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be
required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety. We may not
be able to pass these liabilities through to the product manufacturer, whether due to unfavorable supplier
warranties or supplier credit issues. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our brand, reputation and relationships with our customers could also be damaged by the distribution of
defective products, especially in the event of serious defects, such as incorporating harmful substances that cause
physical harm or other health problems. Such serious defects could also lead to a significant decline in revenue.
There is also a risk that compliance lapses by our international suppliers could occur, which could lead to
investigation by agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement
actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. In all such cases, especially if
there is a prolonged impact on product quality or availability, our business, results of operations, financial
condition and reputation may be materially adversely affected.

**_We rely on certain certifications for the operation of our Trucks segment and the loss of such certifications_**
**_could harm our business._**

In the ordinary course of our truck spare parts distribution and repair business, we install, checks and
calibrates digital and analog tracking devices that record and report the speed and distance (also known as
tachography) driven by trucks. We rely on certifications granted by the French government in order to perform
these services. The regulations governing such certifications are subject to change and we cannot guarantee that
we will be permitted to install, check and calibrate such tracking devices in the future. Additionally, our truck
repair network is certified by the “Qualicert” program, which offers third-party verification of service quality by
SGS, a private certification provider. If we fail to qualify for or maintain any of these certifications, or if the
requirements for such certifications become more stringent, our business, results of operations, financial
condition and reputation may be materially adversely affected.

**_We could face exposure to product liability claims for products that we import from countries outside the_**
**_European Union and sell under our own trademark._**

As a distributor of spare parts, we may be held liable for defective products if we brand products with our
trademark, such as ISOTECH, and present ourselves as the producer of such products or we distribute products
imported from countries outside the European Union. Some of the products that we distribute are branded with
our ISOTECH trademark. In addition, we sell products imported from countries outside the European Union. By
selling products under our trademark or imported from countries outside the European Union, we may be held
liable for any unforeseen defects in products requiring repair under warranty or recall, which, notwithstanding
possible recourse against the relevant manufacturer and supplier, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Likewise, if our affiliated independent distributors or
branded garages improperly install products, we may be exposed to liability and reputational harm. Additionally,
we can offer no assurance that suppliers will replace defective products in a timely manner or provide us with
sufficient refunds or indemnifications. We could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the
future and incur significant costs to defend any such claims.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, which could adversely affect our business,_**
**_results of operations and financial condition._**

From time to time we are involved in labor, tax and commercial legal proceedings, relating to the conduct of
our business including, but not limited to, claims from our employees, claims of intellectual property
infringement and claims asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices by third parties, the outcomes
of which are difficult to predict. In addition, from time to time, we are subject to product liability and personal
injury claims relating to the products we sell and the properties we operate. In particular, French law provides for
specific protection for consumers in the area of liability for defective products. We are and have been subject to
various tax audits and may be subject to tax audits from time to time in the future. In addition, we could face a
wide variety of employee claims against us, including general discrimination, privacy, labor and employment and
disability claims. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory
proceedings being brought against us by various governmental agencies.

We could become involved in legal disputes in the future which may involve substantial claims for damages
or other payments. Although individually these proceedings do not typically involve substantial amounts, in the
aggregate such proceedings or any increase in the number of such proceedings may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2019, our provision for
litigation amounted to €2.9 million.

In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a
settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the costs related to litigation
proceedings may be significant. Even where we successfully defend ourselves against a claim, we might still
have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants,
insurance or otherwise. Even if there is a positive outcome of such proceedings, any negative publicity
surrounding claims against us or our management, products or services could materially adversely affect our
brands and reputation. All of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition and reputation.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our business, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex and evolving tax legislation in the countries in which we operate. Changes in tax
laws or regulations or in their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, such as our effective tax rate
or tax payments.

In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to
varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting
(“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement
Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative
efforts within our business and impact existing structures.

Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this
respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying
down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12,
2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017, by the
Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid
mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions),
as from January 1, 2020. The ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to
which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to
several exceptions). Such rules apply since January 1, 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by
Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance
_Law for 2019”). The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) (the “French_
_Finance Law for 2020”) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed_
the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Tax Code. See “Risk factors—
_Risks related to our business—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of_
_all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to_
_service our indebtedness” for more details on this rule._

In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the anti-abuse
provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive
tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax
authorities might ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the
main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the
applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances.

The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016,
including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base
(“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding
loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing
new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on
the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of
the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It is
expected to be implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and
consolidation being put in place swiftly afterwards. Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already
apply since January 1, 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into
French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position
in the future.

We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which
we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of
these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could
require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to
track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Finally, political responses to the economic consequences of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic may
include increases in taxes or implementation of new taxes in various jurisdictions.

**_The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax_**
**_purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where we operate may impact our financial results._**

The Council of the European Union adopted on December 5, 2017 its conclusions on the EU list of
non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the “Council Conclusions”) which is composed of two sub-lists
(respectively, the “Black List” and the “Grey List,” together referred to as the “EU List”). The EU List was
established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the
Council of the European Union during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions. The Black List,
which shall be updated at least once a year, is currently (according to the list as of February 18, 2020) composed
of twelve jurisdictions (American Samoa, Cayman Islands, Fiji, Guam, Oman, Palau, Panama, Samoa,
Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States Virgin Islands and Vanuatu). Furthermore, the Council
published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in
order to comply with the European Union screening criteria.

Though there is no applicable sanction yet, Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to
agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased
monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions.

A French law that aims at fighting against tax fraud was published on October 24, 2018 (Law 2018-898 of
October 23, 2018) and has expanded under certain conditions the French tax regime regarding non-cooperative
states or territories (États ou territoires non coopératifs) as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax
Code (“Non-Cooperative States”) to certain states and jurisdictions included in the Black List. As a result,
interest paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in certain states and jurisdictions included in the
Black List or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such states and jurisdictions may be
subject to withholding tax in France and not be deductible for purposes of the computation of the debtor’s
corporate income tax liability. The anti-abuse measures apply to states and jurisdictions newly added to the list,
in principle, as from the first day of the third month following the month during which the addition is made
(although the Administrative Guidelines (as defined hereinafter) still continue to refer to January 1 of the
following year (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211)), it being mentioned that the French list has recently been
updated and includes the states and jurisdictions contained in the former version of the Black List dated
November 7, 2019 (Ministerial Order dated January 6, 2020 amending the ministerial order dated February 12,
_2010). Such list of Non-Cooperative States currently includes, in addition to Panama, which was already_
included in the former version of this list, the following states and territories: American Samoa, Anguilla, the
Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Fiji, Guam, Oman, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, the United
States Virgin Islands and Vanuatu.

**_Our business may be materially adversely affected by VAT rate increases in the countries where we operate._**

As of December 31, 2019, our products were subject to VAT in each of the countries where we operate with
different applicable rates set by each such country. For example, the VAT rates that are applicable to us are 20%
in France, 21% in Belgium, 21% in the Netherlands, 22% in Italy and 21% in Spain. From 2010 to 2012,
European governments increased VAT rates in order to bolster public finances, and there can be no assurance
that VAT rates will not be further increased in the future. Our published retail prices are inclusive of VAT.

If VAT rates were to increase in the future, our profitability margins will be negatively impacted if we do
not increase the prices of our products to match the increase in VAT. However, if we pass the increase in VAT
on to our customers by raising the prices of our products, the demand for our products may decline, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we
face VAT risks arising out of our operating activities in the normal course of business and typical acquisitionrelated VAT risks relating to prior acquisitions and reorganizations.

**_Changes to accounting standards may affect our reporting of financial results._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. Any changes in
these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our reported results and financial condition. In
particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain IFRS
standards have been recently revised by the IASB. For example, on January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS
16 (Leases) and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 and the
related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as
the distinction between operating and finance leases is eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes

47


-----

an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay rental expenses. The only exceptions are
short-term and low-value leases. We have applied IFRS 16 since January 1, 2019, its mandatory application date.
The implementation of IFRS 16 resulted in an increase in total assets at January 1, 2019 of €170.2 million, in
total liabilities of €171.4 million and a positive impact on Adjusted EBITDA of €47.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. In addition to this new standard, the IASB may in the future adopt further changes or
additions to IFRS, which we may be obligated to adopt and the impact of which would be initially uncertain.

In June 2017, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting treatment
of uncertainties in income taxes, specifically in relation to taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses,
unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12. IFRIC 23
states that an entity should assume that the applicable taxation authority will have full knowledge of all relevant
information when examining amounts reported to it. An entity therefore has to consider whether it is probable
that the applicable authority will accept a certain tax treatment in the entity’s income tax filing and either adopt
an approach consistent with the tax treatment in its income tax filings or use the expected value of the tax
treatment when determining taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates.
IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early adoption
permitted. In adopting IFRIC 23, we applied a modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of
initially applying IFRIC 23, if any, should be recognized in opening equity at the date of initial application. As
part of our adoption of IFRIC 23, we have identified an additional €0.8 million of additional deferred tax
liabilities as of December 31, 2019.

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable French competition and antitrust laws, as well as the rules and
regulations of the European Union regarding antitrust law.

As far as French law is concerned, our business is subject to various specific provisions set forth in the Title
IV of the Book IV of the Commercial code, which relate notably to yearly negotiations and agreements between
suppliers and resellers, invoicing and payment terms, as well as to certain practices referred as “restrictive of
competition” which may lead to significant fines of up to either €5 million, three times the amount of the
advantages unduly collected, or 5% of the undertaking’s turnover in France. Breach to these rules may also lead
to civil liability actions initiated by our contractors or competitors with a risk of payment in relation to
compensation claims.

We may also become subject to legal action or investigations and proceedings by French and supranational
competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of antitrust laws in France or at an EU level, which
could result in fines (of up to 10% of the Group’s consolidated worldwide turnover) or other forms of liability, or
otherwise damage our business reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition to such sanctions with respect to the public enforcement of antitrust laws, our company may then
be subject to proceedings initiated before French Commercial Courts in private enforcement, i.e. in compensation
for the damages resulting from anticompetitive practices previously sanctioned by antitrust authorities.

Such laws and regulations could limit or prohibit our ability to grow in certain markets.

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Bain Capital indirectly owns the majority of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, our shareholders have and
will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the
ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations and to control the
outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances
may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to
pay our obligations as they mature. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional
indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and
hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also pursue
acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities
may not be available to us. In addition, our shareholders may hold interests in suppliers or customers of ours. Our
shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or
other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions
might involve risks to the holders of the Notes.

**Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations_**
**_of its own and will depend on cash from its operating subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the Notes._**

Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company with no business operations other than the
equity interests it will hold in its subsidiaries, and in the case of the Issuer, certain operations related to the
management of our group. We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, separate and distinct
legal entities. Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will be dependent upon the cash flow from their
operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations,
including the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Parent Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee.
The amount of dividends and distributions available to each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will depend
on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under
applicable law or existing contracts, including the restrictions contained in the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures and the Indenture. The subsidiaries of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor, however, may not be able
to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer
or the Parent Guarantor to make payments in respect of their respective obligations, including under the Notes
and the guarantee of the Parent Guarantor. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than Autodistribution
S.A.S.), that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

The amount enforceable under the Guarantees may be limited, and the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations
_on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a_
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of
Autodistribution S.A.S. is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the outstanding amount
under existing proceeds loans, which is approximately €330 million and corresponds to the aggregate of the
existing proceeds loan made available to on-lend the proceeds of the issuance of Existing Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes and Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may
not be similarly limited.

None of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries will have any obligation to pay amounts due under the
Notes or to make funds available for that purpose, including subsidiaries that are borrowers under the Revolving
Credit Facility but do not guarantee the Notes. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of,
non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their
claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or
the Parent Guarantor as a direct or indirect shareholder of such subsidiaries.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Parent Guarantor will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

   - the creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or the
Parent Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2020, after giving
pro forma effect to the Refinancing, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries would have had total debt of approximately
€245 million (excluding bank overdrafts), of which approximately €156 million would have been incurred in
connection with lease liabilities, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the
Guarantees. Any of the debt that the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with
the Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have and, after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant amount of
outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of March 31, 2020, and as adjusted to give effect

49


-----

to the Refinancing, our pro forma third-party borrowings would have been €1,226.4 million, which reflects
external loans and borrowings, including lease liabilities, of which €300.0 million would have been represented
by the Notes. The terms of the Indenture will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial
additional indebtedness, including, but not limited to, in respect of committed borrowings of up to €100.0 million
under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.”

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations, including, but
not limited to:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt
and liabilities;

   - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt,
thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and
capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater
financial resources than we have;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and
industry;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

   - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

   - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity
capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to
fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future operating performance and
ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to
general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt
or fund our planned capital expenditures.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur
will be structurally senior to the Notes if such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes, and such debt could be
secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Indentures contain, and the Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions,
and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. Borrowings under debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or crossdefault provisions, including the Notes, may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. We may
be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the
leverage-related risks described above. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Indentures do not, and the Indenture will not, prevent us from incurring obligations or entering other
arrangements that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, such as receivables securitization
financings. For a discussion of our cash flow and liquidity, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources.”

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside_**
**_our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which_**
**_may not be successful._**

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable

50


-----

us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including the Notes. If the business disruptions caused
by COVID-19 last longer than we expect, we may continue to seek other sources of liquidity, and there can be no
guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms and in an amount
sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our future
cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to
fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We can
provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives in a timely manner
or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time.
Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or
future debt instruments and the Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore,
we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be
on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional
financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt
obligations, including under the Notes. In such an event, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments
that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have
sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a
timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur
additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and
other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including under the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and to use the
proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or to obtain the
funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from
asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due.

**_We are subject to covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default under our debt_**
**_covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

Our Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures contain, and the Indenture
will contain, covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on
our ability to:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

   - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

   - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

   - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

   - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary;

   - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

   - sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

51


-----

   - change the “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) of the Luxembourg Security Providers;

   - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

   - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants.” These covenants could limit our ability to finance future operations_
and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest.
Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These
include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or
restrictions, in addition to being in default under the Indenture and the Notes, we could be in default under the
terms of the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the
relevant lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any,
immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. This would also result in an
event of default under the Indenture. If the debt under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Notes or the Guarantees or any other material financing arrangement
that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other
debt.

Our Revolving Credit Facility also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy a specified financial maintenance test
in certain circumstances. The ability to meet this test could be affected by a deterioration in our operating results,
as well as by events beyond our control, including increases in raw materials prices and unfavorable economic
conditions, and we cannot assure you that this test will be met. If an event of default occurs under the Revolving
Credit Facility, the lenders thereunder could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under
other debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may
be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in
full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding, including the Notes. See “Description of
_certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest_**
**_on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness._**

The French Finance Law for 2019 has included specific provisions which have implemented into French tax
legislation the provisions of the ATAD regarding in particular interest deductibility limitations in respect of fiscal
years opened as from January 1, 2019.

In relation to such implementation, (i) the provisions of (x) Articles 212 bis and 223 B bis of the French Tax
Code (i.e., the former 25% general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses (“rabot fiscal”)) and
(y) Article 209-IX of the French Tax Code (the “Amendement Carrez” limitation) have been repealed and (ii) the
provisions of Article 212-II of the French Tax Code (i.e., existing thin-capitalization rules) have been amended,
as developed in more detail below.

The other rules limiting interest deductibility generally remained unchanged, in particular the rules relating
to the maximum deductible tax rate for interest paid to direct minority shareholders or to related parties (Articles
39.1.3° and 212-I-(a) of the French Tax Code).

Under Article 39.1.3° of the French Tax Code, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to
lenders who are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the
meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the
borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate
equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of
two years (1.32% with respect to fiscal years closed on December 31, 2019). Non-deductible interest pursuant to
such limitation will be treated as deemed dividend under French tax law and may in particular be subject to
withholding tax, subject to applicable tax treaties. By exception, Article 212, I-(a) of the French Tax Code
provides that, in respect of a given tax year, interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the
meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the
French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent
financial credit institutions in similar circumstances.

52


-----

Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by
an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted
EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses
and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and
capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both relatedparty and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited
exceptions.

Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a
safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that
the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the
accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the
30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount.

French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the
related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5x the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial
expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its
adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed
from or made available by non-related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code
increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year)
by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The
balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its
adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from
or made available by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5x
the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average
amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. Nevertheless, the
interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the
borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group (as determined under
accounting consolidation rules) to which it belongs is higher than its own debt-to-equity ratio.

Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely
and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which
tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only
eligible for carryforward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal
year might also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in
respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities.

Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30%
Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and
(ii) the 1.5 debt-to-equity ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules
applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by
related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French tax Code which do not belong to the same tax
consolidated group.

These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer’s tax consolidated group (in respect of
any loans contracted by the Issuer from any related party) and at level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do
not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of
the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect
of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party.

Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 includes specific provisions which implement into French tax
legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which are
applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which would be applicable as from
January 1, 2022.

In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the French tax Code (i.e., the
former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed.

53


-----

Articles 205 B et seq. of the French tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest
deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding
inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without
_inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both_
the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments
taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an
arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to
certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable
income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving
entity will be included in its taxable income if the deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity.
If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the
receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. The new provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities,
referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent in its country of establishment but the
jurisdiction of its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly an aggregate of more than 50% of the
voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit, qualify the entity as non-transparent. In this situation, the
entity would be treated as taxable in its jurisdiction of establishment (either at the level of the entity or at the
level of its shareholders or partners).

The above-mentioned tax rules may limit the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries’ ability to deduct interest
accrued on the group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow
available to service our indebtedness.

**_The liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished if the proposed financial transactions tax or any_**
**_similar tax were adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on a common financial
transaction tax (the “FTT”) to be implemented under the enhanced cooperation procedure by several Member
States (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain (the “Participating
_Member States”) and Estonia. However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate._

The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain
dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The mechanism by which
the tax would apply and be collected is not yet known, but if the proposed directive or any similar tax is adopted,
transactions in the Notes would be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be
diminished.

Under the 2013 proposals, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside
of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes where at least one
party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial
institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of
circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State, or
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore
be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may
decide to participate and/or certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If the proposed
directive or any similar taxes are adopted, such taxes could increase the transaction costs associated with the
purchases and sales of the Notes and could reduce liquidity in the market for the Notes.

Prospective holders of Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
consequences of the FTT.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture, and the change of_**
**_control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain_**
**_important corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer will be required to offer
to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on

-----

the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a
change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time,
or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes
or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other
existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may
result in an event of default under, or the acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Indentures and other indebtedness. Furthermore, the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to
such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The
ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its respective subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the
Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources.
Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting
a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the
Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect
that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a
change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture,
which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain other
indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of control.” The change of control
provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important
corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting
power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” (as defined in the
Indenture).

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net
leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such an event.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise, established definition of that
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and
its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg_**
**_Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or_**
**_security interests in the Collateral._**

The Guarantors guarantee and provide security in respect of, and the Luxembourg Security Providers
provide security in respect of, the payment of the Notes on a senior basis. The Guarantors and the Luxembourg
Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of France and Luxembourg, respectively. Enforcement of the
obligations under a Guarantee against the Guarantors or the enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral
will be subject to certain defenses available to the Guarantors or a Luxembourg Security Provider in the relevant
jurisdiction, as the case may be. Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses may include
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, voidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital
maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more
of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no liability or decreased liability under its
Guarantee or the security interest in the Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable depending on the
amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantees against the Guarantors or
security interest in the Collateral against any Guarantor or any Luxembourg Security Provider. See “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests.”_

55


-----

**_The Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be declared unenforceable against_**
**_third parties under fraudulent conveyance laws._**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside bankruptcy
(the “action paulienne”). The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which the
person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for
any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and
any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person by the
bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside
bankruptcy, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties under French law if: (i) the person
performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s
bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time
the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that
one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act
was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not
necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. See “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—_
_France.”_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral_**
**_across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company that is organized and established under the laws of
France, and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are also organized under the laws of France, and
secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg
Security Providers (which are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg). In the event that any one or more of
the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, or any other grantor of security interests in the
Collateral, experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in
any of these jurisdictions. In addition, pursuant to the European Council Regulation (EC) No. 848/2015 on
insolvency proceedings, the court that shall have jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in relation to
a debtor is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has its COMI. Therefore, to the
extent that the COMI of the Issuer or any Guarantor is deemed to be in a particular European jurisdiction, the
courts of such jurisdiction may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings with respect to it, irrespective
of its jurisdiction of incorporation. For a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the European
Union and various jurisdictions in the European Union, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and
_limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

Proceedings could also be initiated in France and Luxembourg to enforce your rights against Collateral
located in those jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for
creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights.
There can also be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you
may receive.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be favorable_**
**_to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes,_**
**_the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized and
exist under the laws of France, and secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the Guarantors, the
Issuer and the Luxembourg Security Providers (which are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg). In the
event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in France or Luxembourg. The
bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of a Guarantor’s or the Issuer’s jurisdiction of organization

-----

may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of
creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-commencement interest and
duration of the proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee
against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. The court may also in certain
circumstances void the security interest or the Guarantees where the debtor is close to or near insolvency.

In France, among other limitations, the granting of new security interests in the Collateral in connection
with the Notes issued is subject to hardening periods, where certain arrangements or disposals that are made
during the “hardening period” (période suspecte) (period running from the insolvency date of the debtor until the
date of the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it) may be
challenged by the receiver in bankruptcy and certain creditors under applicable rules of avoidance. The
applicable hardening period for these new security interests in the Collateral will run from the moment each new
security interest has been granted or perfected. The Indenture will permit the security interests in the Collateral to
be released and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart the applicable hardening
period. If any security interest granted during the hardening period for debts previously incurred were sought to
be enforced, it would be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests—France—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and_
_liquidation proceedings.”_

In addition, in France, insolvency legislation tends to favor the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors. In the context of proceedings affecting creditors, including courtassisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc) proceedings or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation), and
court-administered proceedings (safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde
_financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation_
proceedings (liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes or
the Guarantees could be limited or suspended.

Under French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by the Issuer, a Guarantor or
any relevant security provider, as the case may be, may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses
available to debtors under French law, as the case may be, in respect of the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of such security interest.

For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Issuer, the
Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations
_on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ or the
Luxembourg Security Providers’ jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these
laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply,
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and
_limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—Grand Duchy of_
_Luxembourg.”_

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are entities organized under the laws of
France and Luxembourg with their registered offices or principal places of business in France and Luxembourg.
The directors, managers, officers and other executives of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security
Providers are neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, most of the assets of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers or directors, managers, officers and other executives of the

57


-----

Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are located outside the United States. As a result,
it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce
against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process
within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The United States is not party to a treaty with France or Luxembourg providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in
France or Luxembourg. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement
proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France or Luxembourg of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non
ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French or Luxembourg
court is satisfied that certain conditions have been met. For further information, see “Enforceability of
_judgments.”_

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan and counterparties to future hedging_**
**_obligations (if any) and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a super senior basis under the terms_**
**_of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are entitled to be repaid with recoveries from the_**
**_enforcement of the Guarantee claims and proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the_**
**_Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions that govern the sharing of recoveries from guarantee
claims and proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such recoveries and enforcement proceeds are required
to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes or the
Revolving Credit Facility. The Security Agent is required to pay turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the
Security Agent from enforcement actions to discharge obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE
Loan or future hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness in priority to paying any such amounts to
discharge the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guarantees,
you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
PGE Loan or future hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness are greater than the proceeds recovered.
Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral or the enforcement of the Guarantees will, after
all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and such hedging obligations and, if applicable
future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility have been discharged, be applied pro
rata in repayment of the Notes.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain restrictions with respect to the use of
proceeds from the sale of assets representing the Collateral prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit
Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement—Maturity
_and repayment requirements.”_

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will
have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the
holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the
value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the securities account by judicial or_**
**_contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a_**
**_public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only secure a creditor
up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the
form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales))
may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged assets
in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of the judicial

58


-----

foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte
_commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the_
legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a
judicial foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value
of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or
by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the collateral
exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount
(soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is
true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent
on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an
enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable
law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received
in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a
competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on
the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of
companies or groups of companies. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity
_and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—Limitations on enforcement of security_
_interests and cash amount (“soulte”).”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other
creditors that have the benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to
time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the
ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security
interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the
Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities
or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any
such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon
those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees are secured on a contractually first-priority basis with
security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain other indebtedness and hedging obligations (the “Super Senior Liabilities”). The Indenture will also
permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as
provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement
action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of (i) creditors holding more than 66.67%
of the indebtedness and commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain other indebtedness
permitted to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the proceeds of enforcement of
Collateral (a “Credit Facility”) and the certain priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior
Creditors”) and (ii) the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, creditors in
respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging

59


-----

obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior
Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Notes/Pari passu Required Holders”) (in each case acting through
their respective creditor representatives). However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior
Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of such enforcement instructions first being
issued or if Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement
instructions first being issued or certain insolvency events occur and the Security Agent has not commenced any
enforcement action, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will
prevail, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders may at any time (if the Security
Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) provide
immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/
_Pari passu Required Holders determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could_
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any
transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall
act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with
the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent,
provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event
that is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to the extent the
Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received Proposed
Enforcement Instructions (as defined herein) from the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari passu Required
Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security Agent
shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari passu
Required Holders until such time as a creditor representative acting on behalf of Majority Super Senior Creditors
issues enforcement instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such
prior instructions given by the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the
voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes, the creditors of any other credit facility and the creditors in respect of certain priority
hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents
and other security interests over the Collateral at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the
Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of
its holding companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes
and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents or other transaction security, except through
the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to
have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies
and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral
providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose

60


-----

of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no
enforcement event or acceleration event has occurred, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral
providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary
course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes_**
**_and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

For a description of the security over the Collateral, see “Summary—The Offering—Security.” In the event
of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the
pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. The value of the assets
underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among others, whether or not the business is
sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which
operations are located, the availability of buyers and whether approvals required to purchase the business would
be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in the event of any
distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility,
any other Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment
in full in cash before the holders of the pledges securing the Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from
such distribution with respect to the Notes.

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may
provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be
liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the
Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of
our assets will not secure the Notes, and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to
cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries
pledged to secure the Notes and/or the Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged
because all the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or
no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these
entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the
Collateral may decline over time.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the
Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties have liens on the
Collateral, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such
holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could
reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes
under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the
Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral. Although we
will be subject, under the Indenture, to certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness that will
be secured by the Collateral, including a Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio contained in the
Indenture (as defined and described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”), the definition of Senior Secured Indebtedness contained in the Indenture or the_
purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio contained in the Indenture contains
certain important exceptions and carve-outs.

**_The security over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the
Notes but have been granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide, and the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the Security Agent and Parallel Debt (as defined below) creditors
have the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the
Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture)
provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.

-----

Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by
such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of the
creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under
Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the
French Civil Code which came into force on 1st October 2017. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes
from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the
Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt”
obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the
“Principal Obligations”).

Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed
by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard
proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure
will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general
recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim.
There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French
law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee will have certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly
important following defaults or events of default, and acts in the interests of the holders of the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011_
n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, among others, the Trustee. To the extent that the
security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee. See “Certain insolvency
_law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security_
_interests—France” and “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability_
_of the Guarantees and the security interests—Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.”_

**_The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the_**
**_Notes._**

If there is an event of default under the Indenture, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent
of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes. In addition, in the future, the
obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, whether as a result of the
creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in certain circumstances, linked to our obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture
may require, subject to local law limitations, such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the
Notes. The agreed security principles set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a number of
limitations on the rights of the lenders to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the

62


-----

agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral
provided being limited or security not being granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets.
Accordingly, the agreed security principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the assets securing those Notes
and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future
senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as
security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be
satisfied in full before the claims of certain unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Investors’ rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The security interests in the Collateral
may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees if we or the Security Agent are not able to or
do not take the actions that are necessary to perfect any such security interests. Neither the Trustee nor the
Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or actions to perfect any of these security interests.
Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee
in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, applicable law
may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be
perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the
Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and
rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security
interest in such after-acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of
additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such
failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in
favor of the Notes and the Guarantees against third parties. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and
_limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—Rights in the_
_Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.”_

Additionally, the Indenture and the Security Documents entered into in connection with the Notes do not
require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the security interests of the
Security Agent in the Collateral. To the extent that the security interests created by the Security Documents with
respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general
unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings.

**_The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate_**
**_Notes bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash_**
**_flow._**

The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate
Notes bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR (and in respect of certain
utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, LIBOR), as adjusted periodically (and, in respect of
the Revolving Credit Facility, a zero floor applying to EURIBOR/LIBOR), plus a margin. These interest rates
could rise significantly in the future. We may enter into certain interest rate hedging arrangements designed to fix
a portion of these rates but are not required to do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that hedging will
continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. These interest rates could rise significantly in the
future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital
expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes or on our other debt instruments.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the_**
**_Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Release of Liens,” including, but not
limited to:

   - in the case of Collateral (other than the lien granted over the shares of the Parent Guarantor), in
connection with any sale or other disposition of property or assets constituting Collateral (as
applicable), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Limitation on sales of assets and
_subsidiary stock” covenant, described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” is otherwise_
permitted in accordance with the Indenture;

   - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of the Guarantor;

   - as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Amendments and waivers” and
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Limitation on Liens”;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Satisfaction and_
_discharge”;_

   - in respect of liens over the Collateral granted by LuxCo 5, upon the final release and discharge of the
liens granted over such Collateral in respect of the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes;

   - the property, assets and shares of a restricted subsidiary designated as an unrestricted subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

   - in respect of the security provided by LuxCo 5 and LuxCo 6 securing the Notes, upon a change of
control; and

   - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless consented to and subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the Guarantees or
security interests in the Collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

   - for consideration, all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; and

   - pursuant to an auction or other competitive sale process, under the consultation of an internationally
recognized investment bank or accountancy firm which shall (save in certain circumstances) opine on
the consideration received by giving a fairness opinion.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks
due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by
reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments because of economic, political and
other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which
an investor measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments.
Investments in the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined in “Tax considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if
any. See “Tax considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations.”

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of a Note exceeds its issue price by an amount greater than or equal to a
statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Note will be considered to be issued with original issue discount

64


-----

(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any Note is issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated
interest on the Note, a U.S. holder will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary interest
income) as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the
receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable and regardless of the holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income
Tax Considerations.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and
other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the
future so warrant. On May 25, 2020, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. downgraded the rating of the Existing
Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes from B3 to Caa1. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Guarantees have not or will not have been, and are not required to be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in
the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with
Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of
investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the
Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. For further information,
see “Transfer restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined herein) will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive
registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange for book-entry
interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or
holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole
registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will
make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’
accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the
Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners
of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on
the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest to exercise any rights and obligations of a
holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only to the extent they have
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the
granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

65


-----

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will
be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear
and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-entry,
_delivery and form.”_

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

   - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes
may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of
Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although the Issuer has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed on the
Official List of the Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date and to maintain such listing as long
as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become, or remain, listed. If the
Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make
or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the
Exchange, provided that it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on
another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no
assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or
another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing
exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell
Notes in the secondary market.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—IPO Pushdown’’), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt_
Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things the Issuer (and all related provisions) will
now refer to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of
the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the indenture governing the Notes. Such a
modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange
could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners
of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes the
New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In
such event, U.S. holders (as defined under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”) would be required to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in_
advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO
Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be €300.0 million. We intend to use the
gross proceeds from the Offering to (i) fund the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes Redemption, (ii) fund
the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Redemption and (iii) pay the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the foregoing.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Refinancing are shown
in the table below. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
accrued interest on debt being repaid, the issue price of the Notes, differences from our estimates of fees and
expenses associated with the Refinancing.

**Overview**

We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain, with over 55 years of experience.
Since the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline)
distributor in the business-to-business (“B2B”), business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) and
business-to-consumer (“B2C”) segments. We hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by
our unique operational model and value-added services proposition, our history of organic growth and valueaccretive acquisition-led growth as well as our strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended March 31,
2020, we generated revenue of €1,782.9 million, an Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of €197.8 million and a Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €219.9 million.

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018. We also hold
leading positions around the rest of Western Europe and, in 2018, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM
distributor in both Belgium and Italy (21% and 4% market share, respectively), the fourth largest light vehicle
IAM distributor in the Netherlands (5% market share). We entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the
acquisition of 75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, a leading B2B distributor in Catalonia with approximately 27 sites as
of December 2019, and a member of AD Parts, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain,
with 30% market share in 2018.

**Key factors affecting our results of operations**

The following are key factors that have significantly affected our results of operations and financial
condition and liquidity during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 and the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 or which we expect will significantly affect (or continue to affect) our results
of operations in the future.

**_Factors related to our industry_**

_Dynamics of the aftermarkets for spare parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair_

The following factors may affect the distribution aftermarkets in which we operate in any given period:

   - **Size of the car parc/truck fleet. The number of light vehicles and trucks on the road impacts the size**
of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles and trucks. The size of the car parc in Western
Europe has grown steadily in recent years and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 0.1% between
2018 and 2025. Growth of the car parc is impacted by population size, the rate at which new cars are
introduced into circulation and the rate at which old cars are retired from the road. The size of the truck
fleet in France, our primary truck market, has remained more or less flat in recent years and is expected
to grow slightly between 2019 and 2023. Growth of the truck fleet is impacted by the same factors as
those impacting the car parc, plus general economic factors which may result in an increase or decrease

71


-----

in the number of new registrations as a function of demand for commercial shipping (which tends to
increase during times of economic growth and decrease during times of economic difficulty).

   - **Age and quality of the car parc/truck fleet. The average age of light vehicles and trucks in operation**
also has an impact on the distribution aftermarkets in which we operate. In the EU, the average age of
the light vehicle car parc has increased from approximately 9.6 years in 2011 to 10.5 years in 2019, a
trend which is expected to continue. In France, our largest market, the average age of the light vehicle
car parc has increased from approximately 8.0 years in 2007 to 9 years in 2019, and is expected to
increase to 9.3 years by 2030. In general, older vehicles require more repair and maintenance services
and spare parts than younger ones, and as a result, an increase in the age of the car parc and truck fleet
is expected to have a positive impact on our operations. The age of the car parc and truck fleet is
impacted by the sales price and production quality of new light vehicles and trucks because both high
sales prices and increasing production quality (which generally enables vehicles to run longer without
repair or replacement) generally lead owners and truck fleet managers to delay the purchase of new
light vehicles and trucks, respectively, which could lead to decreased demand in the short term for our
products and services, although such purchases would also increase the size of the car parc or truck
fleet, potentially stimulating demand for our products and services in the medium- to long-term.
Additionally, regulations may continue to evolve in connection with gas emissions, which may lead to
upgrades to the car parc overall.

   - **Miles travelled. Vehicles that are frequently used and driven for longer distances typically require**
more repair and maintenance services and replacement of spare parts than those that have traveled less.
The average annual mileage for light vehicles is structurally resilient, with limited or no impact from
economic downturns. General economic conditions impact mileage, and government incentives that
encourage carpooling and the use of public transportation may also reduce miles travelled. The fleet
mileage for trucks in France is also expected to grow, mainly driven by the recovery in Europe of the
manufacturing and construction sectors and associated transportation needs.

   - **Job frequency. Our results are impacted by the frequency with which drivers and truck fleet operators**
seek repairs on their vehicles or require replacement parts. Higher job frequency benefits us because it
increases demand for the products that we distribute and the services we provide. A number of factors
affect job frequency. As the car parc and truck fleet age, the need for repairs and/or maintenance
increases, thus increasing job frequency. Likewise, increased average mileage of the car parc and truck
fleet tends to also translate into greater job frequency as parts reach the end of their useful lives sooner.
Finally, general economic conditions can also impact job frequency, as during an economic downturn,
drivers or truck fleet managers may postpone non-essential vehicle repairs and maintenance due to
their diminished spending power.

   - **Preference for independent garages over manufacturers’ dealers’ garages. We believe that the**
diminished spending power of consumers and the increasing age of the car parc and truck fleet have
encouraged drivers and truck fleet managers to rely more on garages operating in the independent
segment, as opposed to the manufacturers’ dealers’ segment. On average, the IAM provides more
competitive pricing than the OES. Certain customers prefer, however, particularly during the warranty
coverage period, to have their light vehicle serviced in a manufacturer’s dealer’s garage, due to the link
between the manufacturers’ dealers’ garage and the original light vehicle manufacturer, despite current
EU regulations that allow customers to use independent garages without impacting their warranty.
Manufacturers’ dealers’ garages tend to use original vehicle manufacturer parts that generally have
higher prices than those offered by us.

   - **Diversity of the car parc. There are many brands and models of vehicles on the road in our**
geographic markets, each of which requires specific spare parts for repairs. Any increase in the variety
of spare parts would benefit large, integrated distributors such as us because we have the scale to stock
a wide variety of spare parts. As a result, we can serve as a one-stop-shop for our end-customers, who
increasingly require a wider range of products. This increase in brands and models of vehicles may
adversely affect manufacturers’ dealers’ distributors, which focus on single brands, and small-scale
IAM distributors, which are less able to offer a wide variety of spare parts. An increase in the variety of
brands and models of vehicles may lead to further consolidation among smaller IAM distributors,
thereby further benefiting established, large and integrated distributors such as us.

The factors described above have generally had a positive impact on our results for the periods under
review, and we believe have generally increased our ability to maintain stable earnings and cash flow.

72


-----

_Technological trends in our industry_

Our results are impacted by evolving technical specifications and new technologies in our industry and our
ability to timely respond to such trends. Technological advancements in the light vehicle and truck market, such
as the increasing number of driver assistance systems, collision prevention systems, control devices and other
electronic components, have resulted in more complex and more expensive repair processes and related spare
parts. The increased use of technology in the manufacturing of light vehicles, trucks and their respective spare
parts has improved the quality and extended the lifespan of key light vehicle and truck components, such as
exhaust systems, tires, and brakes. These trends have adversely affected our operations in certain of our business
segments because light vehicle and truck spare parts tend to wear out less frequently, which in turn lengthens
maintenance service cycles, lowers job frequency and leads to lower demand for spare parts and repair services.

Furthermore, due to ongoing technological developments, independent garages need to acquire the
appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components and gain access to the training, tools, instruments
and parts that such technological developments demand. Failure by independent garages to do so may result in an
increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by manufacturers’ dealers’ garages with the
necessary technical expertise. Similarly, given the extended lifespan of spare parts, certain truck and light vehicle
manufacturers have extended their new warranties (in the case of light vehicles to eight years or more, as
compared to four to five years in the past) and provide long-term service programs to customers. Nevertheless, in
many cases, decreasing volumes have been offset by increased prices for technologically advanced spare parts
and complex repair services. In addition, certain technological advancements may require entire modules or
systems to be replaced in certain types of light vehicles, as opposed to discrete parts, thereby increasing
replacement costs and decreasing market shares for small garages.

_Competition_

We face competition in our markets from two principal types of market participants: OE distributors and
other IAM distributors. The OE segment typically specializes in light vehicles and trucks from newly-purchased
to three-year-old vehicles, and captures a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties, as
well as a more limited share of repairs of light vehicles and trucks aged four years and older. Certain vehicle
manufacturers have, however, extended their new light vehicles warranties to up to eight years and now cover
longer-term maintenance and repairs. We also face direct competition from other IAM distributors, particularly
on the basis of operational efficiency and price.

We also compete against online light vehicle and truck spare parts retailers that mainly compete with us on
the basis of price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the Internet before
making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price. We realized at an early stage
that the Internet offered innovative opportunities for light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors. In order to
take advantage of these opportunities, we acquired Oscaro in November 2018, the French leader in online sales
of light vehicle spare parts. Oscaro is one of the first online players to offer new spare parts from manufacturers
and wholesalers, generating the majority of its revenue from the B2C (DIY) segment.

_General economic conditions_

Our business and the demand for certain products that we distribute are affected by general economic
conditions in the markets in which we operate. While our business and the IAM in Western Europe as a whole
have generally proven resilient during economic cycles, each of our business lines responds differently to general
economic conditions. Our light vehicle business line tends to demonstrate resilience during weaker general
economic conditions, as light vehicle owners switch to cheaper independent garages from manufacturers’
dealers’ garages and the average age of the car parc increases, increasing demand for maintenance. This provides
our business with an element of counter-cyclicality, in spite of vehicle owners delaying repairs for a short period
of time. Our truck parts distribution business line shows a higher correlation with general economic cycles, with
miles driven by trucks, and therefore demand for truck parts, increasing as general economic conditions improve.
Our collision repair business tends not to be significantly affected by general economic cycles. In addition,
certain of our products, such as brake pads, belts and other critical parts, tend to exhibit inelastic demand, even
during difficult economic conditions, while more discretionary items, such as accessories for light vehicles and
trucks, tend to be impacted more by the economic climate, for example during COVID-19.

_Regulation_

The market for the supply and distribution of spare parts is affected by regulatory changes in each of the
geographies in which we operate, including those that govern access to the spare parts aftermarket for IAM
distributors and those that seek to impact vehicle safety and other driver behaviors.

   - **Block Exemption Regulation: The market for the supply and distribution of light vehicle and truck**
spare parts and the provision of repair and maintenance services has been generally liberalized as a
result of EU regulations. Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 dated May 27, 2010 was adopted to promote
fair and effective competition among aftermarket players, vehicle manufacturers and authorized
repairers, by ensuring that aftermarket players have access to spare parts and technical information
relating to such spare parts. The current regulatory framework (valid through to May 2023) is favorable
for IAM players such as us because it provides for: (i) full access for independent light vehicle and
truck spare parts manufacturers and garages to the technical information needed to ensure effective
competition within and between the IAM and the OE aftermarket, (ii) customers’ rights to engage
independent garages throughout the life of the light vehicle with no warranty limitations, (iii) the
unrestricted sale of light vehicle and truck spare parts in the IAM and (iv) resellers’ rights to use
private brands and logos for light vehicle and truck spare parts sales.

   - **Traffic laws and policy: The overall market for collision repair in France has been affected by a**
decline in collisions as a result of the increased enforcement of and publicity surrounding traffic laws.
We have, however, increased our market share in this declining market by strengthening our
relationships with car insurance companies, providing collision parts at lower prices and improving our
supply chain for the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision repair. Likewise, regulations applicable
to trucks are particularly stringent and apply high standards for truck safety through periodic technical
controls.

   - **CICE: In addition, our results are also impacted by government policies in France relating to payments**
for certain social charges, such as CICE. In December 2012, CICE, a tax credit for encouraging
competitiveness and jobs, was adopted as part of an overall stated French government policy to
improve the competitive position of companies in France. However, Article 86 of the French Finance
Law for 2018 (law 2017-1837 of December 30, 2017) abolished the CICE for salaries paid as from
January 1, 2019. Another concurrently enacted law (law 2017-1836 of December 30, 2017) partly
balanced the elimination of the CICE by decreasing, under certain conditions, by one point the rate of
one of the employer’s social security contributions as from January 1, 2019. For the year ended
December 31, 2019, however, we have not identified a significant impact. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our business—Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation_
_to labor and employment, and changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely_
_affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” for further information._

Our results are affected by operational improvement measures that we implement.

We have developed and continue to implement operating strategies designed to enhance profits. One of our
most important competitive advantages has been our ability to use the purchasing power we have derived from
our large size and our fully-integrated, automated warehouse and logistics systems. In recent years, we have
strategically reduced the number of suppliers we use, concentrating larger volumes of purchases among fewer
suppliers, which has enabled our CPU to negotiate better purchasing terms and conditions for the products that
we distribute. We have also streamlined our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and distribution network to get
products to our customers increasingly rapidly and cost effectively. As a result of these measures, we have
significantly improved our cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations from €103.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €109.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We intend to
continue optimizing purchase conditions with our key suppliers. In addition, we intend to continue to integrate
our upstream supply chain to increase our margins.

_Distribution network and branded garages_

Our local distribution model includes wholly-owned distributors and independent affiliated distributors. We
had 31 wholly-owned distributors as of December 31, 2019. Conversions of wholly-owned distributors to

-----

independent affiliated distributors, and vice-versa, may have an impact on our profitability and, in addition,
overhead costs are higher for administering the wholly-owned network of distributors as compared with the
network of independent affiliated distributors.

Additionally, if our network of distributors, including both wholly-owned and independent affiliated
distributors, were to shrink or expand, our revenue could be impacted. Similarly, many of our customers are
garages, some of which are branded garages. We had entered into agreements with 3,673 branded garages as of
December 31, 2019. Turnover in and maintenance or extension of our network of branded garages also has an
impact on revenue. For example, if our network of branded garages were to shrink, we might generate lower
revenue as a result. On the other hand, if our network of branded garages were to expand, it might generate
higher revenue.

**_Key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations_**

_COVID-19_

Our operating performance is subject to global economic and market conditions, including their impact on
the global automotive industry. Although it is at this stage too early to predict the medium- to long-term effects
of the pandemic on the markets in which we operate, the COVID-19 outbreak impacted our operational and
financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the month ended January 31, 2020, our
sales increased by approximately 2.4% compared to the month ended January 31, 2019, and for the month ended
February 29, 2020, our sales increased by approximately 5.8% compared to the month ended February 28, 2019.
Our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately €12.9 million for the month ended January 31, 2020, and
approximately €11.6 million for the month ended February 29, 2020. Our revenue reached €320.7 million (and
€310.4 million excluding AD Bosch) for the two months ended February 29, 2020 as compared to €298.5 million
for the two months ended February 28, 2019 (representing an organic growth of approximately 3.9% and an
actual growth of approximately 7.3%), Adjusted EBITDA reached €24.5 million (and €23.4 million excluding
AD Bosch) for the two months ended February 29, 2020 as compared to €20.1 million for the two months ended
February 28, 2019 (representing an organic growth of approximately 15.9% and actual growth of approximately
21.6%) and a growth of approximately 6% in our Light Vehicle France for the two months ended February 29,
2020 as compared to the two months ended February 28, 2019. Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA declined
sharply in the second half of March 2020 and in April 2020 as a result of the lockdown measures implemented in
the markets in which we operate. Despite the sharp drop in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, we outperformed the
market in terms of the trough in our performance during the lockdown (with a decline of 60% compared to a
decline of 80% for the market in the last week of March 2020) and the pace of recovery, as we were less
impacted than the market every single week of the lockdown.

Our revenue for the month ended March 31, 2020, decreased by 26.4% organically, compared to the month
ended March 31, 2019. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operations in March 2020 limits the
comparability of our results for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in
2019. See “Recent Developments—COVID-19 pandemic and recovery” for additional information on the
measures we implemented following the outbreak and our financial recovery in May and June 2020.

_Acquisitions and disposals_

We have historically pursued external growth through acquisitions in the past and intend to continue to seek
opportunities for acquisitions in the future. During the periods under review, we have successfully acquired a
number of businesses that are complementary to our existing operations, including:

   - On March 22, 2017, we acquired Mondial Pare-Brise, a French windshield repair specialist, and a stake
in Grup Eina, a Spanish company specialized in offering digital technical support and data management
for vehicle repairmen;

   - In 2017, we formed a joint company, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., with three distributors of light
vehicle spare parts, OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto, making it the number two light vehicle spare part
distributor in Italy. Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. is a holding company and is a joint venture with certain
managers of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car. We hold 55% of the share capital and voting rights of
Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. and a call option for further shares of Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., which
may only be exercised starting from May 2020 and at a pre-agreed, fixed EBITDA acquisition
multiple;

-----

   - On March 1, 2018, we acquired additional interests in Sarco, increasing our ownership from 49% to
100%;

   - On March 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Société Française d’Industrie Automobile
(“SFIA”), a wholesale and retail light vehicle distributor in Epernay, in eastern France;

   - On May 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in GPR Auto, a wholesale and retail light vehicle
distributor in southern France;

   - On May 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Geevers, an independent distributor of light vehicle
spare parts in Benelux;

   - On May 31, 2018, OVAM acquired 100% interests in FGL Srl, an Italian distributor specialized in car
body parts and lightning;

   - On June 19, 2018, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. acquired 100% interests in G-Group, an independent
spare parts distributor in Italy;

   - On July 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Vallespir Auto Diffusion S.à r.l., a wholesale and
retail vehicle spare parts distributor in southern France;

   - On October 1, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Loire Pare-Brise a windshield repair specialist a
subsidiary of Mondial Pare-Brise in France;

   - On October 31, 2018, Doyen Auto Belgium S.A. acquired 100% interests in Verviers Freins, a multibrand distributor of mechanical parts, bodywork, paint, tools and garage equipment in Belgium;

   - On November 13, 2018, we acquired a 82.49% interest in Oscaro, the leading online seller of light
vehicle spare parts in France;

   - On August 5, 2019, we acquired a 75% interest in AD Bosch, the leading parts distributor in Catalonia;

   - On September 30, 2019, General Auto, acquired 100% interests in Team Ricambi Srl, a wholesaler
specialized in light vehicle and truck spare parts, and industrial components based in Italy;

   - On September 30, 2019, Geevers acquired 100% interests in Loek Autoparts B.V., a distributor of
collision repair parts in the Netherlands;

   - On October 4, 2019, Truck & Car Services acquired 100% interests in Maillot Pièces Poids Lourds, a
distributor in Eastern France; and

   - On December 12, 2019, we acquired an additional 0.10% interest in AD Bosch and we hold a 75.1%
stake in AD Bosch since that date.

Furthermore, in 2017, we decided to exit the Polish market by divesting our Polish subsidiary, AD Polska,
to Rhiag Group. Following the disposal of AD Polska, it was classified as discontinued operations. In our
consolidated income statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, AD Polska’s net result is shown in the
caption “Discontinued Operations.” In our consolidated cash flow statements for the year ended December 31,
2017, AD Polska’s cash flows from operations, investing and financing activities are shown in separate lines as
discontinued operations.

These acquisitions have affected our results and limit the comparability of our results from period to period.
These acquisitions as well as potential future acquisitions and disposals will continue to impact our results. By
further participating in the industry-wide consolidation of our markets and integrating acquired entities into the
Group, we believe that we can increase the purchasing power of our CPUs to negotiate better contractual terms
with suppliers, thereby improving our margins. We believe we are well positioned to be a natural consolidator in
the fragmented markets in which we operate, and we intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions to
further expand our network in order to increase our market share and purchasing power, as well as, realize other
economies of scale.

_Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 9—Financial instruments_

We adopted IFRS 9 on January 1, 2018, prospectively. The comparative periods presented have not been
restated to reflect the potential impact. Under IFRS 9, we applied the simplified approach permitted thereby,
which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized at the initial recognition of the receivables. For
receivables of our major customers, a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses is recognized based on each

76


-----

customer’s credit ratings. For other receivables, a portfolio approach is applied to the extent they have similar
credit risk characteristics and provision is recognized according to certain criteria based on days past due of the
receivables and actual historical default rates. The impact of the first adoption of IFRS 9 on our consolidated
statement of financial position as of January 1, 2018, is described in note 4.1.2 to the audited condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16—Leases_

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. We adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which has an impact on our reported
consolidated assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flow statement. We prepared our financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2019, under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative
results are not restated. On transition, for leases previously accounted for as operating leases with a remaining
lease term of less than 12 months and for leases of low-value assets, we have applied the optional exemptions to
not recognize right-of-use assets but to account for the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining
lease term. For those leases previously classified as finance leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are
measured at the date of initial application at the same amounts as under IAS 17 immediately before the date of
initial application. Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 (which were
prepared after the first application of IFRS 16) are limited in comparability to our results of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2018 (which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16).

The implementation of IFRS 16 resulted in an increase in total assets of €170.2 million and in total
liabilities of €171.4 million, in each case as of January 1, 2019, and a rental costs impact on Adjusted EBITDA
of €47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over income tax treatments_

In June 2017, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting treatment
of uncertainties in income taxes, specifically in relation to taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses,
unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12.

IFRIC 23 states that an entity should assume that the applicable taxation authority will have full knowledge
of all relevant information when examining amounts reported to it. An entity therefore has to consider whether it
is probable that the applicable authority will accept a certain tax treatment in the entity’s income tax filing and
either adopt an approach consistent with the tax treatment in its income tax filings or use the expected value of
the tax treatment when determining taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax
rates.

IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early
adoption permitted. In adopting IFRIC 23, we applied a modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative
effect of initially applying IFRIC 23, if any, should be recognized in opening equity at the date of initial
application. As part of our adoption of IFRIC 23, we have identified an additional €0.8 million of additional
deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2019.

**Explanation of key income statement line items**

The following is a brief description of the revenue and expenses that are included in the line items of our
income statement.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service
to the customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset. Revenue can be broken
down as follows:

   - _Sales revenue through our logistics platforms: We distribute spare parts for light vehicles and trucks,_
based on a highly sophisticated distribution system that requires significant investments in logistics.

   - _Direct flow sales commission: We also sell spare parts, equipment and tools that are delivered directly_
by suppliers to independent distributors and do not pass through our logistics platforms. When such
third-party suppliers other than us are involved in providing goods to a customer, we assess whether the
nature of our promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods itself

77


-----

or to arrange for the suppliers to provide those goods or services. We are considered an agent if our
performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods by the suppliers and revenue is
recognized for the amount of any commission to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for
arranging for suppliers to provide our goods. The commission revenue recognized corresponds to the
difference between the consideration received from the customer less the consideration due to the
supplier that provided the goods. Where direct delivery is made by suppliers to independent
distributors, we are invoiced by suppliers and then invoice such distributors. Related payment flows are
processed by us.

**_Cost of goods sold_**

Cost of goods sold includes purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories and net allocation to
inventories depreciation.

**_Personnel costs_**

Personnel costs include wages, social security contributions, profit-sharing plans and pension costs. Pension
costs include the allocation to provisions for retirement benefits for the year as well as the reversal of provisions
as a result of benefits paid during the year.

**_External expenses_**

External expenses relate to non-direct operating costs, including rental expenses (including under IFRS 16),
shipping expenses, maintenance and repair costs, legal and other fees, IT expenses, advertising expenses,
subcontracting costs, travelling and other expenses.

**_Taxes other than income taxes_**

Taxes other than income taxes include taxes on salaries (mainly taxes in respect of vocational training), the
social construction tax (Participation à l’effort de construction), the real estate business contribution (Cotisation
_foncière des entreprises), the social solidarity contribution (Contribution sociale de solidarité des sociétés, a tax_
_calculated based on a percentage of revenue) and other taxes other than income tax._

**_Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses include other items related to our ordinary activities, such as losses
for doubtful accounts and service fees related to B2B websites for electronic catalogs, and commissions paid and
received as part of the service connecting insurers and vehicle repairers.

**_Depreciation/amortization expenses_**

Depreciation expenses represent the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right of use
following the application of IFRS 16. Amortization relates to intangible assets, excluding goodwill and brands,
such as AD. Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

**_Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations generally relate to one-off events or other events outside of our
ordinary business. Other income and expenses from operations can include gains and losses on the disposal of
operations, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as costs relating to provisions and
expenses relating to significant and unusual restructuring, employee and tax disputes and impairment losses/
reversals on goodwill and brands, including AD and costs related to major acquisitions and to our previously
contemplated initial public offering.

**_Financial income and expenses_**

Financial income includes income from financial investments, foreign exchange gains and other financial
income. Financial expenses include interest on external loans and bank overdrafts payable by us, discounting of
borrowings and debt, expenses related to financial instruments and to finance leases, foreign exchange losses and
other financial expenses.

**_Income tax_**

Income taxes consist of current tax expense, CVAE (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises) and
changes in deferred tax assets.

**Description of other key financial indicators**

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses adjusted for certain items that we consider to be non-recurring or exceptional in nature, or
otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business including start-up costs related to new
businesses, income and expenses attributable to the implementation of our transformation plan, fees paid to our
shareholders and exceptional one-off expenses related to professional conferences and as further adjusted to
eliminate the impact of IFRS 16 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31,
2019 and 2020. See the table set forth in “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information” for
a reconciliation of operating income from ordinary activities and Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss) from
continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, and the years ended December 31,
2017, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.

Revenue decreased by €14.5 million, or 3.2%, from €451.2 million for the three months ended March 31,
2019, to €436.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the impact of the
COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. This decrease was partly offset by (i) the revenue contribution of AD Bosch,
which we acquired in August 2019, and (ii) an increase in sales for the two months ended February 28, 2020.

   - Light Vehicle France: Light Vehicle France revenue decreased by €14.7 million, or 6.3%, from
€230.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to €215.7 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease of €22.9 million in sales in March 2020 due to the
impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. This decrease was partly offset by an increase in sales by
€8.9 million for the two months ended February 28, 2020.

   - Trucks: Trucks revenue decreased by €3.6 million, or 8.3%, from €43.6 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2019, to €40.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to
lower sales in March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.

   - Light Vehicle International: Light Vehicle International revenue increased by €5.8 million, or 5.2%,
from €111.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to €117.2 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, mainly due to (i) the acquisition of AD Bosch in Spain, which generated
€13.8 million of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and (ii) an increase in sales of
€1.5 million for the two months ended February 28, 2020, partly offset by a decrease in sales of our
mechanical parts business in Belgium and Italy in March 2020 by €9.6 million, largely due to the
impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Benelux body parts activity remained stable given that the
Netherlands did not implement a strict lockdown.

   - Digital B2C: Digital B2C revenue decreased by €2.0 million, or 3.1%, from €65.8 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2019, to €63.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily
due to a decrease in sales of €3.6 million in March 2020 following the COVID-19 outbreak. This
decrease was partly offset by the lower impact of lockdown in France on this segment.

_Cost of goods sold_

Cost of goods sold decreased by €9.6 million, or 3.6%, from €263.7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019, to €254.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a reduction in the
volume of sales and purchases in March 2020 following the COVID-19 outbreak. Cost of goods sold increased
by 4.7 % between the two months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, which is in line with the sales
increase.

As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold remained stable at 58.4% for the three months ended
March 31, 2019, and 58.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €1.0 million, or 1.1%, from €89.3 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019, to €90.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the integration of
AD Bosch.

As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs increased from 19.8% for the three months ended March 31,
2019, to 20.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the effect of the acquisition of AD
Bosch, which had a higher personnel cost base than the Group’s average personnel cost base for the three months
ended March 31, 2020.

_External expenses_

External expenses decreased by €2.5 million, or 4.5%, from €55.1 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019, to €52.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to lower expenses
and other fees, such as legal fees, which decreased by €2.9 million as a result of the one-off expenses incurred in
connection with the plan we implemented in 2019 with respect to the integration of Oscaro.

As a percentage of revenue, external expenses decreased from 12.2% for the three months ended March 31,
2019, to 12.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the effect of the acquisition of AD
Bosch, which had lower external expenses than the Group’s average.

_Taxes other than income taxes_

Taxes other than income taxes increased by €0.6 million, or 10.9%, from €5.5 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2019, to €6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income and expenses decreased by €0.4 million from an expense of €0.4 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2019, to an expense of €0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

-----

10.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a €7.8 million decrease in Adjusted

2019, based in Spain and (ii) the increase in 2019 of the sales of Doyen Group to Autodoc, a web
dealer positioned in western Europe.

   - Digital B2C: Digital B2C revenue was €259.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily

87


-----

segment of our Light Vehicle France segment remained fairly stable at 8.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2018, and 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to (i) the good
performance of the body parts platform, as a result of both a higher activity and lower shipping costs
linked to our collaboration with a new shipping partner in 2019, (ii) a higher mechanical parts activity
in 2019 and (iii) an increase in our CPU revenue through our automated Logisteo platform, as a result
of the higher rebates granted to the customers.

   - Trucks: The Adjusted EBITDA of our Trucks segment increased by €1.4 million, from €4.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018, to €5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the
Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Trucks segment increased from 2.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2018, to 3.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to adjustments in
sales prices, as a result of our effort to generate higher net margins.

   - Light Vehicle International: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Light Vehicle International segment
increased by €8.1 million, from €29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €37.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Light Vehicle
International segment increased from 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, to 8.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the effect of the acquisitions in Benelux, Italy and Spain
and higher purchasing synergies in Italy.

   - Digital B2C: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Digital B2C segment was €2.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and the Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Digital B2C segment was 1.1% for the
year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the positive effects in 2019 of the implementation of
our turnaround plan with respect to Oscaro.

   - Headquarters: The Adjusted EBITDA of our Headquarters function decreased by €1.2 million, or 9.7%,
from €(12.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, to €(13.6) million for the year ended
December 31, 2019, primarily due to our decision to strengthen our central functions to support our
development.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations decreased by €0.8 million, or 100.0%, from €0.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, to nil million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the one-off
reimbursement received in 2018 related to an insurance claim for a fire accident of one of our platform sites,
which amounted to €0.6 million.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations decreased by €6.4 million, from €15.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, to €9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the one-off expense
of €7.9 million incurred in connection with the IPO project we undertook in 2018, partly offset by an increase in
strategic review costs of €4.3 million in 2019.

Net financial expense increased by €14.3 million, from €42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
to €56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to (i) higher interest costs of €10.8 million,
mainly related to the Existing Senior Secured Notes and (ii) the interests on lease right of use of €4.8 million
linked to the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019, partly offset by the one-off depreciation in Oscaro’s shares of
€4.7 million in 2018.

Revenue increased by €211.0 million, or 16.8%, from €1,254.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2017, to €1,465.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the expansion of operations
through acquisitions in France, Benelux and Italy.

   - Light Vehicle France: Light Vehicle France revenue increased by €47.6 million, or 5.6%, from
€855.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €902.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to (i) the full impact of the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise on
March 22, 2017, (ii) the acquisition in 2018 of SFIA, GPR Auto, Vallespir Auto Diffusion S.à r.l. and
Loire Pare-Brise, which generated €3.0 million of revenue since their respective acquisition dates and
(iii) organic growth generated by gains in market shares mainly as a result of increased revenue from
Affiliated Distributors and an increase in our CPU revenue due to a larger product offering made
available through our new automated Logisteo platform (mechanical parts, painting and equipment),
which allows us to recognize the full amount of revenue, as we sell directly to customers rather than
through our distributors.

   - Trucks: Trucks revenue increased by €10.6 million, or 6.7%, from €157.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €168.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to
(i) organic growth following the ongoing implementation of a new distribution model and business
re-organizational measures at the Group level; and (ii) the addition of new AD Poids Lourds workshops
generating additional sales.

   - Light Vehicle International: Light Vehicle International revenue increased by €126.8 million, or
52.4%, from €242.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €368.9 million the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to the full-year effect of the acquisitions of Italian distributors
(OVAM, Ricauto and Topcar) in 2017 and the acquisitions of Geevers and G-Group in 2018.

   - Digital B2C: Digital B2C revenue was €26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result
of the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018.

_Cost of goods sold_

Cost of goods sold increased by €144.7 million, or 20.7%, from €699.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €844.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher sales
volume as a result of both acquisitions and organic growth.

As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 55.7% for the year ended December 31,
2017, to 57.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This slight increase as a percentage of revenue was
mainly due to a time lag in realizing purchasing synergies from the recent acquisitions and the lower gross
margins from the recently acquired Italian businesses (taking into account the full-period impact from
acquisitions completed in 2017 and the contribution of acquisitions completed in 2018), partly offset by the fullyear impact of Mondial Pare-Brise’s purchasing synergies.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €30.9 million, or 11.2%, from €276.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2017, to €306.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the integration of OVAM,
Topcar, Ricauto, Mondial Pare-Brise, G-Group, Geevers and Oscaro.

As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs decreased from 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017,
to 20.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to
(i) our productivity improvements; and (ii) the effect of the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and G-Group
in Italy, which have a lower personnel cost base than the Group’s average.

_External expenses_

External expenses increased by €27.6 million, or 16.6%, from €166.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €193.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to (i) higher
advertising expenses, which increased by €4.7 million between the relevant periods due to one-off expenses
related to a large-scale AD network conference held in September 2018 and (ii) higher transportation costs,
which increased by €9.6 million, between the relevant periods, as a result of higher activity, increasing fuel costs
and increasing cost of the transportation service companies.

-----

As a percentage of revenue, external expenses remained stable, representing 13.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2017, and 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to (i) the effect of the
acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, and G-Group in Italy as well as Geevers, which have a lower external
expense cost base than the Group’s average; and (ii) our efforts to monitor and control external costs.

_Taxes other than income taxes_

Taxes other than income taxes increased by €0.2 million, or 1.8%, from €11.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

equipment depreciation expenses increased by €1.0 million, or 5.9%, from €16.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to the effect of the
acquisitions of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, G-Group and Geevers which increased the amount of depreciation and
amortization expenses.

_Operating income from ordinary activities_

€4.3 million, or 5.5%, from €77.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €73.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

including purchasing synergies. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Light Vehicle International
segment increased from 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 8.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to purchasing synergies.

   - Digital B2C: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Digital B2C segment was €(6.1) million, as a result of the
acquisition of Oscaro.

   - Headquarters: The Adjusted EBITDA of our Headquarters function decreased by €0.5 million, or 4.2%,
from €(11.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €(12.4) million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, primarily due to our decision to strengthen our central functions to support our
development.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €0.1 million, 14.3%, from €0.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €2.0 million, from €13.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to (i) €7.9 million
costs related to our then contemplated initial public offering, including financial consulting costs as incurred up
to date; and (ii) an increase in IT transformation costs, from €1.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2017
to €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was partly offset by (i) the one-off expense
related to the implementation of the new Logisteo platform in Réau for the year ended December 31, 2017,
which amounted to €3.7 million, and (ii) the one-off expense in 2017, related to the provision for retirement
costs, due to the harmonization of the collective employment agreement for all the employees of the Group.

Net financial expense increased by €15.6 million, from €26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
to €42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher interest costs related to the
additional €80.0 million Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes issued in April 2017 and additional
€175.0 million Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes issued in July 2018, the depreciation in Oscaro’s
shares of €4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and higher financial income for the year ended
December 31, 2017, due to the gain on disposal of AD Polska.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes increased by €7.2 million, from a €5.4 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2017,
to a €12.6 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower deferred tax variance.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, income taxes comprised CVAE of €5.4 million (compared to
€5.6 million in for the year ended December 31, 2017), a current income tax expense of €4.2 million (compared
to a €3.9 million current income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017) and a deferred tax expense
of €2.9 million (compared to a deferred tax benefit of €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017).

_Net income from discontinued operations_

Net income from discontinued operations decreased by €28.9 million, from €32.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, to €3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and relates to AD Polska.

_Net income_

As a result of the factors described above, our net income decreased by €27.6 million, or 88.2%, from a net
income of €31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to a net income of €3.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements
of its business, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, operating losses,
acquisitions, and contractual obligations and commitments. Our principal sources of liquidity have been our
existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, factoring facilities, bank overdraft facilities
and finance leases.

We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash
generated from operations, debt securities (including the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and the
Notes offered hereby), any borrowings under our working capital and bank overdraft facilities, including our
Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan, factoring facilities and finance leases. We may from time to time
seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, our liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

93


-----

Our financial condition and liquidity have been, and are expected to continue to be, influenced by a variety
of factors, including:

   - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

   - the level of our outstanding indebtedness, and the interest we are obligated to pay on such
indebtedness, which affect our finance costs;

   - prevailing interest rates, which affect our debt service requirements;

   - our ability to continue to borrow funds from banks;

   - our level of acquisition activity

   - our capital expenditure requirements; and

   - the medium- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our cash requirements are expected to consist mainly of the following:

   - paying operating costs and working capital;

   - funding capital expenditures;

   - funding potential acquisitions;

   - servicing indebtedness; and

   - paying taxes.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, future borrowings under our Revolving
Credit Facility and the PGE Loan and potential future borrowings under debt securities will be adequate to meet
our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the
Notes or other debt when due, such as the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes. In addition, there is a
significant increase in economic uncertainty due to the impact of COVID-19, which already impacted our results
for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and may impact our financial condition and our ability to raise
financing in the future. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—Any outbreak of severe communicable
_diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.”_

If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements
exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital
depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other
financial institutions, capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt and our general financial
performance. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to
_generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and may be_
_forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_

**_Historical cash flows_**

The following table sets forth our historical cash flow items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018

Net cash from operating activities is mainly impacted by changes in working capital and other items with a
cash effect, in addition to changes in net income and cancellations of unrealized income and expenses, the
elimination of financial expenses and income with a cash effect and the elimination of income tax.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €115.6 million, or 26.5% of
revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a favorable change in working capital of
€79.8 million mainly driven by an increase in trade payables as a result of an extension of the payment terms
with certain large suppliers.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €35.3 million, or 7.8% of
revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a favorable change in working capital of
€4.1 million offset by income taxes of €5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €110.1 million, or 6.1% of
revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and includes the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019,
which increased depreciation and amortization expenses by €44.5 million and decreased rental expenses by
€47.6 million, compared to what the net cash from operating activities from continuing operations would have
been before the adoption of IFRS 16. Excluding the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16, net cash from operating
activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily driven by the
unfavorable change in working capital of €41.8 million due an increase in inventories mainly in connection with
the build-up of stock by Doyen Auto to supply Autodoc.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €58.9 million, or 4.0% of
revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an unfavorable change in working capital of
€30.9 million due to an increase in inventories, mainly at our Logisteo platform.

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €103.2 million, or 8.2% of revenue,
for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to favorable changes in working capital due to a decrease of
receivables as a result of the new non-recourse factoring program that allows factored receivables to be
deconsolidated, which were partly offset by an increase in inventories due to business acquisitions during the
year and higher year-end activity to fulfill the end-of-year rebates.

- Restated by reclassifying €18.5 million of bank overdrafts of Italian entities outstanding on the date on which we acquired these entities,
from the line item business acquisitions (net of cash acquired) to the line item net cash and cash equivalents for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

Cash flow used in investing activities relates to (i) capital expenditure, which consists of the acquisitions of
non-current assets, and (ii) the acquisitions of business, net of cash acquired.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€8.4 million driven by capital expenditures of €8.2 million. See “—Capital Expenditures.”

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€8.6 million driven by capital expenditures of €8.4 million. See “—Capital Expenditures.”

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€91.0 million driven by new business acquisitions of €51.8 million and capital expenditures of €40 million,
partly offset by a cash inflow from disposal of assets of €2.4 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€201.3 million driven by new business acquisitions of €163.4 million, mainly due to the acquisition of Oscaro
customer relationship asset (€4.8 million) and brand (€50.6 million), and capital expenditures of €32.8 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of
€84.2 million driven by new business acquisitions of €67.1 million, mainly due to the acquisition of the
Autodistribution Belux customer relationship asset (€10.0 million), and capital expenditures of €28.0 million.

_Capital Expenditures_

Our capital expenditures consist solely of the acquisition and maintenance of non-current assets. Our capital
expenditures include the further expansion of our operations and the maintenance of our existing operations. In
particular, our capital expenditure on tangible assets mainly relates to purchases of shelving and machinery for
the transport and storage of products in our warehouses, as well as purchases of commercial delivery vans that
we use in our operations. Our capital expenditure on intangible assets mainly relates to the capitalization of new
functional development costs of our “Enterprise Resource Planning” software, the purchase of software licenses
relating to management and financial reporting, technical light vehicle and truck databases and inventory
management.

Capital expenditures decreased by €0.2 million, to €8.2 million, or 1.9% of revenue, for the three months
ended March 31, 2020, from €8.4 million, or 1.9% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2019,
primarily due to a reduction in investments following the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.

Capital expenditures increased by €7.2 million, to €40.0 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2019, from €32.8 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily
due the integration of capitalized development costs from Oscaro for €3.0 million and €1.5 million of investment
in Mondial Pare-Brise.

Capital expenditures increased by €4.8 million, to €32.8 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2018, from €28.0 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily

96


-----

due to the increase in maintenance capital expenditures following the acquisition of OVAM, Ricauto, Topcar and
Mondial Pare-Brise, partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to the automated Logisteo platform
finalized and launched in 2017.

Although we intend to continue to make investments on maintenance and development of our existing
business, we intend to take a conservative approach with respect to capital expenditures for the year 2020 due to
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the countries in which we operate.

_Business acquisitions_

Business acquisitions mainly relate to external acquisitions. The amount of the acquisition is presented net
of cash (or overdraft) held by such acquired entity.

There was no business acquisition for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €51.8 million, or 2.9% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2019, mainly due to the acquisition of 75% interests in AD Bosch for a purchase price of
€48.1 million in August 2019.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €163.4 million, or 11.1% of revenue, for the year
ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to the acquisitions of (i) 82.49% of the capital stock of Oscaro, the leader
in online sales of light vehicle spare parts in France, for an amount of €91.3 million in November 2018; (ii) 100%
of the capital stock of G-Group for an amount of €15.8 million in May 2018, which enabled us to enter the
Central and Southern Italian market and to strengthen our number two position in the Italian market; and (iii)
100% of the capital stock of Geevers, the leading independent retailer of multi-brand car body parts in Benelux,
for a purchase price of €50.2 million in May 2018.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €67.1 million, or 5.3% of revenue, for the year ended
December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made four acquisitions: (i) in March 2017 we
purchased 100% of the capital stock of Mondial Pare-Brise for an amount of €35.8 million, which aims to create
purchasing and logistics synergies with Cora’s windscreen business; (ii) in March 2017 we purchased 100% of
the capital stock of four truck distributor companies for an aggregate purchase price of €1.3 million; (iii) in May
2017, we purchased 55% of the capital stock of three leading Italian distributor companies, who are leading
stockiest distributors in northern and central Italy, for an amount of €29.2 million; and (iv) in May 2017 Doyen
Auto purchased 100% of the capital stock of two auto parts distributors for an aggregate amount of €4.6 million.
During the same period, we disposed of 100% of AD Polska for €13.3 million, net of cash transferred, as well as
100% of APS Berwald (ten sites in Moselle) for €4.2 million.

related to repayment of lease debt (IFRS 16) and €10.5 million to the repayment of Italian credit lines, and (iii)
€29.6 million of new borrowings, driven by an additional drawdown of €28.0 million under the Revolving Credit
Facility.

Net cash from financing activities amounted to an outflow of €9.3 million, or 2.1% of revenue, for the three
months ended March 31, 2019. Our financing activities consisted of (i) €9.5 million interest paid primarily on the
Existing Senior Secured Notes (ii) €174.1 million of repayment of borrowings, mainly related to the repayment
of €90.0 million under the Revolving Credit facility and the redemption of €72.0 million of Existing 2016 Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes, and (iii) €174.1 million of new borrowings, primarily due to the issuance of
€175.0 million of the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.

Net cash from financing activities amounted to an outflow of €32.9 million, or 1.8% of revenue, for the year
ended December 31, 2019. Our financing activities consisted mainly of (i) an increase in borrowings of

Notes and the drawdown of €50 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) €210.7 million of repayment
of borrowings, mainly related to the repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility and €50.5 million interest paid.

Net cash from financing activities amounted to an inflow of €149.1 million, or 10.2% of revenue, for the
year ended December 31, 2018. Our financing activities consisted mainly of an increase in borrowings of
€263.2 million, primarily due to the issuance of €175.0 million of additional Existing 2016 Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes in July 2018.

Net cash from financing activities amounted to an inflow of €4.5 million, or 0.4% of revenue, for the year
ended December 31, 2017. Our financing activities consisted mainly of (i) an increase in borrowings of

aggregate principal amount of €80.0 million, partly offset by (ii) repayment of borrowings of €8.5 million
relating to repayment of certain CICE financing and debt held by the Doyen Auto Group and (iii) interest paid for
€27.0 million.

For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we generated a favorable change in working capital of
€79.8 million, primarily due to an increase in trade payables due to one time deferrals on payments to some of
our large suppliers partly offset by early payments of year-end rebates through negotiations with our suppliers
and to a lesser extent due to an increase in inventories, reflecting the build-up of stock at the end of March 2020
in anticipation of border shutdowns and potential supply shortage and a decrease in receivables in connection
with the lower activity in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we generated a favorable change in working capital of
€4.1 million, primarily due to an increase in trade payables of €36 million, partly offset by an increase in trade
receivables by €28.2 million, due to seasonal effects.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated a negative change in working capital of €41.8 million,
primarily due to (i) an increase in inventories of €16.9 million in connection with the build-up of stock by Doyen
Auto to supply Autodoc and the build-up of stock by Geevers and G-Group as part of their product offering
expansion, (ii) a decrease in trade payables of €9.3 million mainly due to the Oscaro turnaround plan
implemented just after the acquisition in 2018 and which included the payment of the supplier debts and (iii) an
outflow of €7.3 million in net other receivables and payables mainly due to VAT.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated a negative change in working capital of €30.9 million,
primarily due to (i) an increase in inventories of €37.1 million as a result of the expansion of our product offering

to take advantage of favorable purchasing conditions and (ii) a €20.3 million decrease in receivables mainly due
to the extension of our non-recourse factoring program to new entities.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated a favorable change in working capital of
€14.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in trade receivables of €44.4 million arising from to the new
non-recourse factoring program that allows factored receivables to be deconsolidated, which was partly offset by
(i) an increase of €9.7 million in inventories, mainly due to business acquisitions during the year and higher
year-end activity to fulfill the end-of-year rebates, (ii) a decrease in trade payables of €9.1 million mainly due to
the longer payment terms with suppliers that were negotiated in 2016 in preparation for the new Logisteo
platform, and (iii) a net cash outflow of €11.3 million of the other receivables and payables, mainly due to the
CICE financing.

**Credit management policy**

We have adopted credit management procedures adjusted to the characteristics of the market and of our
customers in order to reduce the risk of exposure and to attempt to allow prompt and proactive management of
our business. The proactive customer credit risk monitoring activities start by grouping consumers based on their
type, the duration of credit, the existence of previous financial difficulties or notifications and of the possible
existence of legal or ongoing bankruptcy procedures. Financial assets are recorded in the financial statements net
of the write-off based on the risk of breach by the counterparty, which is determined based on the available
information regarding the customer’s solvency.

**Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about financial risk**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks. We monitor and
manage these risks as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce their potential adverse effects on our results of
operations.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The euro is the functional currency in which our financial statements are presented.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risks due to our need to finance our operations as well as to utilize our
available liquidity. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a negative or a positive impact on our financial
results by indirectly influencing the repayment of loans and investments. Following this Offering, our
indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the Notes (which have a fixed interest
rate) and the Revolving Credit Facility (which borrowings will have an interest rate based on EURIBOR/LIBOR,
reset periodically). We do not currently intend to hedge the interest rate payments on our Notes to be issued on
the Issue Date. We may, however, decide to do so in the future.

We evaluate our exposure to changes in interest rates on a regular basis and may decide to manage the
foregoing risks through financial derivatives, according to the directives contained in the “Interest rate risk
management policy” we have adopted. Notwithstanding our potential use of hedging instruments, unexpected
changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**Off-balance sheet arrangements**

We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. For a description of certain commitments
and guarantees that we have given to third parties in connection with our financing arrangements and other
ordinary course rental and other obligations, see note 14 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2020, note 16 to the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31,
2019 and note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Other financial obligations: pension obligations**

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations, see note 8 to our audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Critical accounting policies**

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and assumptions that affect
the results we report. Such estimates or assumptions are based on our historical experience and currently
available information, including expectations of future events that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ significantly from such estimates in light of the uncertainty surrounding
the assumptions and conditions upon which the estimates are based. The following are significant accounting
policies determined on the basis of such estimates and assumptions for which changes during a financial period
could involve a significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.

**_Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold products in
accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

**_End-of-year supplier rebates_**

Trade payables are presented net of end-of-year supplier rebates, which are estimated based on the volumes
purchased and the terms of each supplier contract. The amount of rebates claimable in the subsequent year may
differ from the provisions initially recognized.

**_Employee costs and benefits_**

An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under the defined benefit plans annually using
the projected unit credit method. These calculations include demographic actuarial assumptions concerning
mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections. Probable future benefits are discounted
using a discount rate with reference to the yield on investment-grade bonds. The cost of defined benefit plans is
calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions such as the discount,
salary increase, staff turnover and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable
uncertainty around these estimates.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, we assess whether there is any indication that a non- financial asset might
be impaired. The impairment tests are based on the four-year EBITDA plan for each cost generating unit (“CGU”)
as defined by us. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs most
likely to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and to the lowest level at which goodwill is
monitored by us. The CGUs correspond to subsidiaries or groups of subsidiaries that are included in the same
operating segment and that generate cash flows largely independent from those generated by other CGUs.

The assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result following the
changes of all assumptions. Each year and whenever there is an indication of impairment, we carry out impairment
tests. A valuation of the AD brand is also performed separately, bearing in mind that the impairment of the brand is
reversible if events occur that show that indicators that led to a loss being recorded no longer exist.

**_Deferred tax assets_**

The calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate
how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of tax
management strategies. Recognized deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s six-year business
plan for the year ended December 31, 2017 and of five-year business plan for the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it no
longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some or all of said deferred
tax assets can be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized if it
becomes likely that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.

**Overview**

The Western European light vehicle spare parts market comprises of three main components: (1) the
manufacturing and supply of spare parts by parts manufacturers (“original equipment suppliers” or “OES”) (such
as Bosch, Faurecia, Knorr-Bremse and Valeo) and the supply of branded spare parts by car manufacturers (“car
manufacturers” or “OEM”) (such as Fiat, Peugeot, Renault and VW) who are in turn supplied with spare parts by
the OES; (2) the distribution of spare parts by OE car dealer networks and IAM distributors; and (3) retail sales
and service to drivers by garages, independent repairers, autocenters, tire specialists and fast fitters, as well as
retail locations (such as spare parts outlets and scrap yards) and online players. We are a distributor in the IAM
of the European light vehicle spare parts market and do not act directly as a repairer in this market. Our role as a
distributor remains crucial due to the specificities of this market being positioned as a market leading distributor
with integrated and controlled value chain management. The graphic below shows the flow of light vehicle spare
parts from suppliers, through aftermarket distributors to retail and service center customers and finally to drivers.

We also operate in the IAM of the truck spare parts market in France. Like the Western European light
vehicle spare parts market, the truck spare parts distribution and repair market in France comprises of three main
components: (1) the manufacturing and supply of spare parts by OEM (such as Bosch, Mahle, ZF Aftermarket
and Wabco) and the supply of branded spare parts by OEM (such as DAF, Iveco, Krone, Man, Mercedes Benz,
Renault Trucks and Schmitz) who are in turn supplied with spare parts by the OEM; (2) the distribution of spare
parts by OE truck dealer networks, IAM networks and integrated workshops; and (3) the maintenance and repair
by garages, certified repairers or agents, and integrated workshops. We act as both a distributor and a
maintenance and repair service provider in the IAM of the truck spare parts market in France.

102


-----

The graphic below shows the flow of truck spare parts from suppliers, through the OE truck dealer
networks, IAM networks and integrated workshops to retail and service center customers and finally to owners
and operators of truck fleets.

Light vehicle and truck spare part manufacturing is characterized by a high level of part complexity and
density. Due to the number of vehicle variants in the market and the multiplicity of pieces per vehicle (8,000 per
car on average), spare parts manufacturers collectively produce several million SKUs. OE car and truck dealer
networks primarily source spare parts from specific OEMs and OESs, while IAM distributors mainly employ a
less expensive, multi-brand sourcing approach. Light vehicle and truck spare parts and products can be grouped
as follows:

   - repair and maintenance, such as radiators, alternators, steering and suspension components, brake
systems, spark plugs, oil filters;

   - body parts, such as hoods, bumpers, doors, wings, glass, paints;

   - repairer equipment, such as diagnostic tools; and

   - oil, tires, consumables and accessories, such as antifreeze, coolant, in-car entertainment, navigation
systems.

The Western European light vehicle aftermarket distributes spare parts to garages, certified repairers,
autocenters, tire specialists, fast fitters, retailers and web dealers.

_Garages generally may repair cars from all brands with IAM spare parts and may be “independent” or_
“affiliated” with a brand. Affiliated garages include AD-branded garages, Bosch Car Service, Eurorepar and Top
Garage.

_Certified repairers operate under an OEM banner, such as Renault, Peugeot, VW or Fiat._

_Autocenters are generally self-service shops located near supermarkets. Norauto and Feu Vert are examples_
of autocenters.

_Tire specialists’ principal activity is tire sales and changing. Euromaster and Eurotyre are examples of tire_
specialists.

_Fast fitters are focused on quick service, focused on tires and maintenance. Speedy and Midas are examples_
of fast fitters.

_Retailers include spare parts outlets, supermarkets, scrap yards and gas stations, such as Total._

_Web dealers can be split into three categories: pure-player specialists (such as Oscaro and Mister Auto),_
online tire specialists (such as Allopneus) and, to a lesser extent, e-commerce generalists (such as eBay and
Amazon).

103


-----

The truck aftermarket in France also distributes spare parts to garages, certified repairers or agents and
integrated workshops. Integrated workshops are owned by truck fleet operators and generally have a level of
technical expertise below that of OEM and IAM networks and, as a result, often outsource repairs other than
routine maintenance to OEM and IAM networks. Fraikin, RATP and XPO are examples of integrated workshops.

**_Overview of the Western European light vehicle IAM_**

The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket generated a total revenue of
approximately €27.4 billion in 2018. From 2018 to 2025, the overall Western European light vehicle distribution
core aftermarket is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.4% to €30.1 billion, driven by further organic growth and
consolidation opportunities.

The Western European light vehicle IAM is a large and growing channel of the Western European light
vehicle distribution core aftermarket, and tends to be resilient, predictable and fragmented, presenting significant
opportunities for consolidation, with high visibility into the future addressable market through operational
excellence and economies of scale. From 2018 to 2025, the overall Western European light vehicle IAM is
forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.9% to €18.6 billion. The graphic below shows market sizes as of 2018 and
growth forecasts for the 2018 to 2025 period for the light vehicle distribution core aftermarkets and IAMs in each
of the countries where we operate, as well as certain adjacent geographies.

The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is expected to grow between 1% and 3%
in all geographies shown over the 2018 to 2025 period, with growth in the IAMs forecast to exceed or be on par
with such growth in each country over the same period.

Between 2014 and 2018, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket grew at a CAGR
of 1.9%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc (as defined below), while the Western European
light vehicle IAM gained market share and grew more quickly, at a CAGR of 2.5%, further driven by ageing of a
growing number of cars on the road (the “car parc”).

The graphic below shows the historical and estimated future split of market value and market share between
OE car dealer networks and IAM distributors in the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket
for the periods shown.

The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket tends to be structurally resilient, stemming
from the fact that, even when new car sales fluctuate, the installed car parc requires ongoing repair and
maintenance, which, generally, favors the aftermarket and, particularly, the price-competitive IAM. In addition,

104


-----

automotive technological evolutions contribute to the resilience of the aftermarket by supporting its growth in
value.

As an example of this resilience, the graphic below compares the size of the car parc, new light vehicle sales
and the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket in France for the periods shown. The French light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket is largely uncorrelated to the new light vehicle sales or economic cycles as it serves
a large and steadily-growing installed car parc. For instance, even when new light vehicle sales in France
declined, the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket showed stable growth.

The Western European light vehicle IAM has a high and reliable level of visibility into the future
addressable market, due to the fact that its target market is cars aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under
five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer
networks. As a result, IAM distributors are able to project the car parc that will be serviceable in five years since
the size of the car parc, the vehicle types and the installed technology, are already known from the stage of
production.

Moreover, the Western European light vehicle IAM steadily and structurally grows in Europe gaining
market share over OE car dealer networks. Such growth benefits the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket
through the market of aged cars, the flexible and broad multi-brand network coverage and the growing technical
expertise.

105


-----

Finally, the European light vehicle IAM is highly fragmented. In 2018, the top ten players held 17% of
market share (in terms of revenue), in contrast with the U.S. light vehicle spare parts market, in which the top ten
players (in terms of revenue) held 78% of market share.

**_Overview of the truck IAM in France_**

We act as an IAM truck spare parts distributor and repairer in France. The truck spare parts distribution and
repair core market in France is a mature market that exhibits more cyclicality than the Western European light
vehicle spare parts distribution market. The graphic below shows the split between the OE truck dealer networks,
IAM networks and Integrated workshops in the truck spare parts distribution and repair core market in France in
2018, including market sizes and growth forecasts for the 2018 to 2025 period and for the 2025 to 2030 period.

As shown above, IAM held approximately 18% market share of the overall truck spare parts distribution and
repair market in France in 2018. The IAM’s share of the truck spare parts distribution and repair market in
France is expected to grow slightly through 2030. The truck IAM in France is forecast to grow at a CAGR of
1.3% over the 2018 to 2030 period. This growth is compounded with forecasted fleet age decreasing to 2025 as a
result of the recovery of new registrations post 2015, followed by an increase in fleet age beyond 2025 to 2030,
as well as an increased technical complexity of trucks. This impacts the capacity of integrated workshops to
perform in-house maintenance and leads to a loss of shares on certain complex operations while positively affects
impacting the extensions of maintenance contracts and guarantees.

**_Overview of digital and online distribution_**

We act as a spare parts distributor in online B2C via Oscaro. The online market is projected to grow in
Western Europe, driven primarily by an increase of online penetration and proactive expansion by large industry
players. The key drivers to online penetration are the following: the development of an offer driven market, the
overall country internet access, the e-commerce maturity, and the appeal for DIY/DIFM. The different levels of
professionalism across B2B (concept workshops and independent workshops) and B2C (DIY Mechanics/
Hobbyists, Consumer/Amateur, DIFM) customers also drive differences in online purchasing behavior. Less
complex and more basic parts or consumables generally have the highest degree of online penetration due to the
highest product confidence and ease of installation.

The competitors in online spare-parts distributors are generally categorized in three groups: Broad-based
online specialists (such as Oscaro, Mister-Auto and Autodoc), marketplaces (such as Cdiscount, eBay and
Amazon) and tire specialists.

**_Overview of impact from future technological evolutions in the automotive market_**

The spare parts distribution and repair markets are expected to be impacted by developments in automotive
technology, increased mobility, and electrification of the powertrain. The development and market penetration of
improved security systems and ADAS are expected to negatively impact collision-based body parts aftermarket
volumes over the long term, offset by higher price of components, while breakthrough technologies (sensors for
ADAS, LIDAR, LED matrix headlights, carbon fiber bumpers, etc.) lead to significant growth in average parts
prices due to complexification (together with trends like wider windshields). Evolution of mobility (such as car
sharing, long term leasing) is expected to lead to a growing number and size of vehicle fleets, and increased
vehicle mileages. The impact of an increased penetration of electric vehicles on aftermarket will remain limited
in the medium term (reduction of moving parts and lower costs of electric components), partially offset by
positive impact of hybrid vehicles penetration. The graphics below further detail the potential impact of electric
vehicles.

**Market drivers and growth potential**

There are four key market drivers in the Western European light vehicle IAM and the truck IAM in France:

   - _Size of the parc/fleet, which refers to the total number of light vehicles or trucks in operation and which_
is driven primarily by new light vehicle or truck sales;

   - _Age of the parc/fleet, which refers to the average age of light vehicles or trucks in operation and which_
is driven by the frequency with which older light vehicles or trucks are replaced with new light vehicles
or trucks;

   - _Prices for spare parts, which is driven primarily by increasing complexity and sophistication of parts_
and systems; and

107


-----

   - _Job frequency, which refers to the frequency with which repairs and replacement parts are needed,_
which is in turn connected to the number of accidents, the increasing reliability of vehicles and to
average mileage.

For further information on the size and age of the car parc, see “Industry—Overview of the Western
_European light vehicle IAM.”_

In addition, we benefit from a favorable regulatory environment, which is characterized by deregulation of
captive parts pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) 461/2010 and Commission Regulation (EU) No
330/2010, EU-level initiatives that favor the transition to low- and zero-emission vehicles pursuant to the Paris
agreement, increasingly strict French regulation on technical inspections of vehicles as well as potential future
regulatory developments that may favor autonomous vehicles. Deregulation of captive parts is expected to occur
in 2020. The liberalization of the captive parts will have a favorable effect on the IAM distributors, enabling
them to address more vehicles aged nine years and under. A transition to low- or zero emission vehicles, as well
as the rollout of autonomous vehicles, both of which could positively impact IAM distributors by increasing the
frequency and number of compulsory testing for vehicles in order to meet various emissions standards as well as
contributing to a more general trend whereby more complex, “new generation” vehicles drive higher parts prices,
as discussed above. Likewise, increasingly strict regulations relating to inspections could also lead to increased
volumes of service and repair.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in France_**

France is the third largest light vehicle distribution aftermarket in Western Europe. The French light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket is large and mature, with revenue of €5.8 billion in 2018, and is forecast to grow at
a CAGR of 1.0% over the 2018 to 2025 period, reaching €6.2 billion in 2025. This represents similar growth to
the 2014 to 2018 period (1.2% CAGR). Growth of the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket through
2025 is expected to be supported by car parc growth (forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.4% from 2018 to 2025,
from 38 million units in 2018 to 39 million units in 2025), car parc ageing, increase in average car mileage and
spare parts price increases. When vehicles get older and fall outside of the OEM warranty period, customers tend
to shift to IAMs, who generally provide more affordable services. IAM garages benefit from increased expertise
and professionalization from distributors, who contribute to an overall increase in quality of service through
specialized training and technical support.

The light vehicle IAM in France generated revenue of €3.6 billion in 2018 and is growing at a more
dynamic pace (forecast CAGR of 1.6% over the 2018 to 2025 period) than both French light vehicle OE car
dealer networks (forecast CAGR of 0.2% over the 2018 to 2025 period) and the French light vehicle distribution
core aftermarket (forecast CAGR of 1.0% over the 2018 to 2025 period). In 2018, the light vehicle IAM in
France held 62% of market share, which is expected to increase at a slightly lower pace to 65% by 2025, driven
by the car parc’s ageing positively impacting IAM volumes, attractiveness of multi-brand positioning for
distribution dealers, garages and consumers and potential regulatory evolution with regard to the liberalization of
captive parts.

-----

and 0.9%, respectively, over the 2018 to 2025 period, reaching €1.8 billion and €1.0 billion, respectively, in
2025. Growth in these markets through 2025 is expected to be supported by slight price increases driven by
increasing complexity of parts, in spite of limited expected car parc growth and slightly declining average
mileage and job frequency.

The light vehicle IAMs in the Netherlands and Belgium generated total revenue of €1.1 billion and
€0.5 billion, respectively, in 2018 and are both growing on par with the Dutch and Belgian light vehicle
distribution core aftermarkets (forecast CAGR of 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively, over the 2018 to 2025 period). In
2018, the light vehicle IAMs in the Netherlands and Belgium comprised 60% and 59% of market share,
respectively, of their distribution core aftermarkets and are expected to increase slightly through 2025.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Italy_**

Italy is the second largest light vehicle distribution aftermarket in Western Europe. In Italy, the light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket is large and mature, with revenue of €6.7 billion in 2018, and is forecast to grow at
a CAGR of 1.6% over the 2018 to 2025 period, reaching €7.5 billion in 2025. Growth of this market through
2025 is expected to be supported by car parc growth, increasing car mileage, ageing of the car parc and slight
price increases.

The light vehicle IAM in Italy generated total revenue of €4.2 billion in 2018 and is growing at a more
dynamic pace (forecast CAGR of 2.8% over the 2018 to 2025 period) than the Italian light vehicle distribution
core aftermarket (forecast CAGR of 1.6% over the 2018 to 2025 period).

In 2018, the light vehicle IAM in Italy comprised 63% of market share of the Italian light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket, which is expected to increase to 68% by 2025.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Spain_**

Spain is the fourth largest light vehicle distribution aftermarket in Western Europe. We entered the Spanish
aftermarket in 2019 through the acquisition of AD-Bosch. Spain represents an area for further potential
expansion by us in the future and displays favorable market dynamics similar to the countries in which we are
already present. In Spain, the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket generated total revenue of €4.4 billion in
2018 and is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 2.3% over the 2018 to 2025 period, reaching €5.2 billion in 2025.
Growth of this market through 2025 is expected to be supported by car parc growth and price increases, while job
frequency is expected to remain stable.

The light vehicle IAM in Spain generated total revenue of €2.5 billion in 2018 and is growing on par with
the Spanish light vehicle distribution core aftermarket (forecast CAGR of 2.4% over the 2018 to 2025 period). In
2018, the light vehicle IAM in Spain comprised 56% of market share of the Spanish distribution core aftermarket
and is expected to remain stable through 2025.

**_Market drivers and growth potential of the truck spare parts and repair aftermarket in France_**

The truck aftermarket in France generated total revenue of €5.2 billion in 2018. From 2018 to 2030, the
truck aftermarket in France is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.3%. The growth is driven by forecasted fleet age
decreasing to 2025 as a result of the recovery of new registrations post 2015, followed by an increase in fleet age
beyond 2025 to 2030, as well as increased technical complexity of trucks, which impacts capacity of integrated
workshops to perform in-house maintenance and leads to loss of shares on certain complex operations while also
positively impacting maintenance contracts and guarantee extensions.

**Competitive landscape**

There are two principal types of players in the Western European light vehicle spare parts distribution
aftermarket: OE car dealer networks and IAM distributors. The OE car dealer network aftermarket is composed
of OEM repairers (who are closely connected to the OEMs) and certified repairers. The Western European light
vehicle IAM is composed of a large number of small, independent distributors and a limited number of large
groups, which incorporate a number of distribution and retail brands. The largest of the groups in Western
Europe in 2018 was LKQ/Stahlgruber, followed by GPC/Alliance Automotive Group, WM Trost, us and Inter
Cars.

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in France_**

The light vehicle IAM in France is highly fragmented, with the top two players holding approximately 58%
market share and approximately 2,000 small local or regional independent players holding 33% of market share

in 2018. In 2018, we held the largest market share among independent players (29%), followed by GPC/Alliance
Automotive Group (29%) through its French subsidiaries (Groupauto (16%), Precisium (8%), Partner’s (4%),
and GEF’Auto (1%)), Groupe IDLP (4%), Laurent (4%) and Aurilis (3%). Additionally, some of the large IAM
groups discussed above are also active in France.

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Benelux_**

The light vehicle IAM Belgium is relatively consolidated, with the top four players holding approximately
46% of market share. In 2018, LKQ held the largest market share (23%), followed by us (15%), MP (4%) and
Auto Binck Group (4%).

The light vehicle IAM in the Netherlands is consolidated, with the top four players holding 79% of market
share. In 2018, LKQ held the largest market share (35%), followed by Auto Binck Group (28%), Groupauto
(10%) and us (5%).

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Italy_**

The light vehicle IAM in Italy is extremely fragmented, with the top three players holding only 16% of
market share, with the remainder held by independent distributors and “jobbers” (the Italian market includes
“jobbers” (ricambisti) who act as an additional layer in its distribution chain between distributors and garages).
In 2018, LKQ held the largest market share (10%), followed by us (4%, including OVAM, Ricauto, G-Group and
Top Car), Datacol (2%) and Giadi Group (2%).

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Spain_**

The light vehicle IAM in Spain is extremely fragmented. In 2018, we (including AD Parts) held the largest
market share (30%), followed by Lausan (5%), Cecauto and Grupo Davasa (3% each).

**_Competitive landscape in the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket in Germany_**

The light vehicle IAM in Germany is quite consolidated, with the top five players holding approximately
69% of market share. In 2018, LKQ held the largest market share (27%), followed by WM (24%), Alliance
Automotive Group (8%), Matthies (6%) and Hess Automobile (4%).

**_Competitive landscape in the truck spare parts distribution and repair aftermarket in France_**

There are three types of players in the truck aftermarket in France: OE truck dealer networks, IAM networks
and integrated workshops. Similar to the light vehicle aftermarkets, OE truck dealer networks are connected to an
OEM and are focused on newer vehicles, generally aged under five years and within their warranty period. DAF,
Iveco, Man, Mercedes Benz, Renault Trucks and Volvo are examples of OE truck dealer networks. Truck IAM
networks may operate under a banner (that is, they are affiliated with or owned by wholesalers) or may be pure
independents, and generally focus on trucks aged over five years. AD, TVI and Groupauto are examples of truck
IAM networks.

In France in 2018, the top four players (in terms of revenue) held 45% of market share in the truck IAM, led
by Groupauto and G-Truck/Top Truck (18%) and followed by AD (12%), TVI (8%) and Todd (5%).

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain, with over 55 years of experience.
Since the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline)
distributor in the business-to-business (“B2B”), business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) and
business-to-consumer (“B2C”) segments. We hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by
our unique operational model and value-added services proposition, our history of organic growth and valueaccretive acquisition-led growth as well as our strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended March 31,
2020, we generated revenue of €1,782.9 million, an Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of €197.8 million and a Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €219.9 million.

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded
distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018, and in the truck IAM in France, with
the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018. We also hold
leading positions around the rest of Western Europe and, in 2018, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM
distributor in both Belgium and Italy (21% and 4% market share, respectively), the fourth largest light vehicle
IAM distributor in the Netherlands (5% market share) and we had entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the
acquisition of 75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, a leading B2B distributor in Catalonia with approximately 27 sites as
of December 2019, and a member of AD Parts, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain,
with 30% market share in 2018.

We operate our business through four operational segments which address the light vehicle independent
aftermarket in France (“Light Vehicle France”), certain light vehicle independent aftermarkets in Benelux, Italy
and Spain (“Light Vehicle International”), the digital activities of Oscaro (“Digital B2C”) and the truck
independent aftermarket in France (“Trucks”). The pie charts below show the breakdown of our revenue by
segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our distribution is carried out by a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local
wholesale distributors who distribute our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages,
independent garages, retail locations and online players. Our operational model is founded on our excellent
relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms, an extensive Western European
distribution network and a broad and loyal base of customers to which we deliver a wide range of value-added
services.

**Our strengths**

**_Leader in the resilient, predictable and structurally growing Western European market_**

We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France (29% market share in 2018 in terms of revenue)
and we hold leading positions around Western Europe (based on a study commissioned by us in 2019). In 2018,
we were the second largest light vehicle IAM distributor in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light
vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands and we entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the acquisition of
75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain. We operate in the
Western European light vehicle distribution “core” aftermarket that is structurally resilient in the face of

111


-----

macroeconomic factors that impact the broader automotive industry and distribution markets. While new car
sales tend to fluctuate with economic cycles, the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket benefits from a
steadily growing installed car parc and the recurring need for maintenance and repairs to be made to the existing
car parc, irrespective of downturns in the economy. New car sales only account for a small portion of the overall
car parc. Approximately 2.6 million new cars were sold in France in 2018, compared with a car parc of
approximately 38 million cars in total. Moreover, in economic downturns customers generally favor IAM
distributors, such as us, over OE distributors due to longer car ownership, as new car sales decrease, as well as
increased price-sensitivity. For example, after a sharp decline at the end of March and beginning of April 2020,
the French light vehicle spare parts market showed resilience and a significant recovery at the beginning of May
2020, also due to a generalized decline in the use public transport as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which
favored car usage.

The IAMs in which we operate show particular strength and growth potential due to two long-term market
dynamics: a stable, slightly increasing Western European car parc and an increase in average vehicle age which
are expected to drive growth in the number of cars that need service by light vehicle IAM distributors like us in
the coming years. Between 2014 and 2018, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket
grew at a CAGR of 1.9%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc, while the Western European
light vehicle IAM grew more quickly and gained market share, at a CAGR of 2.9%. The French light vehicle
distribution core aftermarket revenues and light vehicle IAM revenues are forecast to grow by 1% and 1.6% over
the 2018 to 2025 period. The Western European light vehicle IAM is also expected to continue outperforming
both the broader market and its OE car dealer network competitors in the 2018 to 2025 period. The existing car
parc’s age and mileage increase due to growing mobility needs, including car sharing or long-term leasing, and
increasing the need for maintenance and repair. In France, the average mileage per passenger vehicle has grown
steadily by approximately 1% per year over the 2011-2016 period. We believe that we will be well positioned to
take advantage of this evolution of mobility as distributors associated with a large garage network, such as us, are
expected to be partners of choice of fleet managers.

Light vehicle IAM distributors also have the benefit of a high level of visibility in terms of the future
addressable market of cars needing service and repair. The addressable market for the light vehicle IAM is cars
aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts
and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a result, we can project the size and composition
of the car parc that will require service in the five to ten-year range because car parc size, vehicle types and
installed technology are known from the point of production. We generally service cars over a long period of
time (from five to twenty years), which may require multiple repairs and parts replacements over their lifespan.
We distribute parts for cars that span the entire car parc, covering a wide range of makes and models, giving us a
wider addressable market compared to our OE car dealer network competitors who generally distribute parts for
cars from just one manufacturer.

**_Well-known light vehicle and truck spare parts distributor with critical scale in a fragmented Western_**
**_European market_**

In addition to the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket being highly attractive,
economies of scale favor larger distributors such as ourselves. Extensive logistics, technology and network
investments are necessary to service a broad and fragmented customer base seeking the supply of several million
SKUs for rapid and continuous delivery and the difficulty in building sufficient brand awareness and long-term
relationships with suppliers that are necessary to negotiate competitive pricing. As a result, suppliers can secure
more business when going through us to distribute their products as they can access a wide range of customers,
and therefore they also benefit from our scale. The necessary investments to deliver economies of scale in our
market also present a barrier to entry to competitors in a currently fragmented market. The Western European
light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is fragmented with the top 10 players in Europe representing
approximately 17% of the market in 2018, which also provides significant potential for consolidation, giving an
edge to large distributors, such as ourselves, who are able to service the entire value chain and make strategic
acquisitions.

The increasing technical complexity of spare parts in the automotive industry is also favorable to us. The
higher complexity and value of repair operations are difficult to manage by small independent aftermarket
players without support and technical assistance from expert distributors such as ourselves and drives a strong
and structural increase in spare parts prices and margins. Future technological evolutions are partly driven by the
increasing popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles and of mobility and connectivity services. We forecast that
5.1% of addressable cars will be electric or hybrid by 2030. We also believe that by 2030 up to 1.1% of

112


-----

addressable cars will benefit from automated driving systems which will result in higher prices of components
for these vehicles. Furthermore, as a result of the focus on safety and aesthetics, light vehicle body parts have
improved in quality, from steel-made to aluminum and carbon fiber-made products, which has also increased
prices of the body parts that we distribute. A carbon fiber bumper, for example, is four times more expensive
than the current glass fiber bumpers.

We are able to combine the significant advantage of having a well-known and trusted core brand with the
ability to use affiliated garage networks to target specific markets. Our superior brand awareness is evidence of
our strong positioning in the IAMs in which we operate. According to an independent third-party survey
conducted in France in 2017, the “Autodistribution” brand enjoyed the highest brand awareness among its light
vehicle distributor peers in France, with 92% brand awareness (including unprompted awareness of 74% and
prompted awareness of 18%). The second ranking player in France had only 37% brand awareness. The
“Autodistribution” brand also had a net promoter score of 59% in 2017; the two second ranking players had net
promoter scores of 31%.

113


-----

**_Differentiated and successfully integrated omni-channel business model_**

One of our key strengths is our control over the value chain through our omni-channel operational model
that delivers superior product availability and best-in-class delivery lead times. Our distribution is carried out by
a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who distribute
our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail locations and
online players. Our ability to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and distribution, to
customers has a strong impact on margins. For example, our automated platforms enable us to centralize more
flows, which in turn generates logistics fees from suppliers. Generally, the logistics fees we charge to suppliers
are greater than the logistics costs we incur. Our unique operational model is founded on our long-standing
relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms and an extensive Western
European distribution network. We have a broad and loyal customer base to whom we deliver a wide range of
value-added services. We have also been able to adapt this business model to the markets in which we operate.
We have also been able to adapt this business model to our markets in Belgium and Italy, where distribution is
organized in three steps with “jobbers” acting as intermediaries between distributors and B2B end-customers
(these jobbers are our direct customers instead of garages).

Our model is based on the distinctive, dual proposition of distributing products to customers coupled with
providing value-added services (many of which are digital or online services) to both suppliers and customers.
To suppliers, our scale offers a unique access to a wide, diversified and fragmented customer base, which
suppliers are not able to efficiently address themselves. We have built long-term relationships and enjoy
significant purchasing power with a strategically concentrated group of suppliers, with whom we can leverage

114


-----

our scale to obtain excellent purchasing conditions for our CPUs. Through this supplier concentration strategy,
we have rationalized our supplier relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to
approximately 260 in 2019. We also offer suppliers a number of value-added services, such as marketing support
and access to our state-of-the-art automated warehousing capabilities which allow suppliers to arrange deliveries
to a single delivery point.

To customers, we provide a comprehensive product offering and best-in-class delivery times (h+2 delivery
time on 90% of B2B customer demand) combined with value-added services, such as commercial, technical and
training support, strong and integrated branding and online tools. As a result of our combined product and
services offerings, we are a “one-stop” shop to our customers, which we believe strengthens customer loyalty and
drives market share gain. Unlike many of our competitors, our product range is not limited to certain OEM or
original equipment suppliers (“OES”) parts or to certain types of products. Our product offering covers
approximately 600,000 SKUs (excluding Oscaro) across the spare parts universe, including repair and
maintenance parts, body parts, repairer equipment, oil, tires, consumables and accessories. Additionally, we have
developed our own private label brands: ISOTECH, Xenergy and Requal, which allow us to offer premium grade
products approximately 20% to 30% cheaper than our OEM counterparts and to efficiently target the older part
of the car parc which is subject to a higher price sensitivity. The ongoing centralization of sourcing across our
private label brands allows us to generate higher margins on our private label products compared to third-party
branded products, despite the lower price of the former. We are also well positioned to address mobility shifts, in
particular with our customers involved in fleet management, through which public fleets play an increasingly
important role. With our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and extensive range of value-added customer service
solutions, we are well positioned to meet the needs of fleet operators who look to external supply and fleet
management on a large scale.

In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution models for our Light Vehicle
France and Trucks segments, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic
investments in our automated logistics platforms. We are currently finalizing the implementation of a new
distribution model for our Trucks segment which has allowed us to grow our network of affiliated garages and to
reorganize our former network of 125 distribution sites around 10 regional warehouses as of December 31, 2019,
which can better focus on distribution to local sites, owned and independent garages and integrated workshops.
As a result of this reorganization, we have been able to better utilize our large network and unique range of
value-added services to meet customer demand and we became the only player in the French truck spare parts
market able to serve our full range of customers with two daily deliveries made within four hours.

**_Comprehensive approach to digital solutions in the B2B market_**

A number of our services to suppliers and customers are digital or online services, including our B2B online
order portals, such as Autossimo, Truckissimo and Salto, and our e-book, online training offerings (through Grup
Eina) and multi-brand online diagnostic tool (Diag’issimo). Our B2B car repair and maintenance portals increase
the integration of our distribution business with our technical support capacities, helping us increase customer
loyalty. We also offer online tools for our customers’ clientele, such as the ID Garages online portal, which
allows drivers to schedule maintenance appointments, compare prices and receive quotes for work to be
performed on their vehicles. These services and tools enable our customers to expand their business.

Our approach to capturing the advantages created by an increasingly digitalized ecosystem stretches across
every level of our business. We use digital tools to bolster our value-added services offering to suppliers and
customers, expand our product offering, address a growing online customer base and digitize our operational
model. We therefore believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing importance of the digital
marketplace, which is the fastest growing independent aftermarket distribution channel in France and grew at a
CAGR of 11.4% between 2014 and 2018.

We have also made deep and long-standing investments to increase our web dealer customer base and gain
exposure to the online distribution market. As part of this strategy, we acquired ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in
2016, two distribution platforms dedicated to web dealers. We accelerated this market penetration strategy at the
end of 2018 with the acquisition of Oscaro.

**_Strong growth potential through our B2C (DIY) and B2C businesses_**

In November 2018, we became a direct player in the web dealer market and entered into the online B2C
distribution market through our opportunistic acquisition of Oscaro, the leader in online sales of light vehicle
spare parts in France. Oscaro’s acquisition allowed us to become a truly “omni-channel” distributor in France

115


-----

and the only multichannel B2C (DIY) player in the independent aftermarket auto parts distribution sector in
Europe. In 2019, we served approximately 2.5 million customers in France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal,
received approximately 12,000 orders a day and a portfolio of approximately 1 million SKUs through Oscaro.
Oscaro has a strong leadership in the growing French online light vehicle spare parts aftermarket with an
approximate market share of over 47% in 2019, mainly due to its customer loyalty and high brand awareness.
Oscaro was the first entrant in the online distribution market in France and benefits from an outstanding brand
awareness in France due to its compelling value proposition and expertise (approximately 62% awareness, which
is more than three times as much as its closest competitor on the online distribution market).

Oscaro’s leading market share, superior purchasing terms and, following its integration within the Group,
competitive price strategy positions it well to compete against generalist online players. The automotive spare
parts distribution business requires a very detailed product offering, a highly technical catalog and data
repository, to address a wide range of parts for a multitude of vehicles of various brands, that generalist online
players have difficulty offering as they primarily focus on consumables. In addition, they cannot replicate the
purchasing terms we obtain through our win-win partnerships with suppliers.

**_Successful track record of delivering organic growth supported by accretive acquisition strategy,_**

With over 55 years of experience in our industry, we have built the relationships, infrastructure and
know-how that we believe are critical to success in the Western European light vehicle and truck IAMs. Our
revenue grew from €968.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to €1.8 billion in the year ended
December 31, 2019, with an average organic growth of approximately 3.5% per annum over the period. Over the
same period, profitability also grew. In the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA was €83.1 million
and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.6%. In the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16
increased to €202.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin was 11.2%. The average organic growth in
Adjusted EBITDA was approximately 6.3% per annum over the 2015 to 2019 period.

Our organic growth has been supported by various factors, such as the development of our distribution
model (which has bolstered our offering to customers, thus leading to market share gains), our exposure to fastgrowing channels (such as web dealers), our successful recruiting of new branded garages, the development of
our private-label offers, improved purchasing conditions obtained through our supplier concentration strategy
and our distribution network optimization strategy. In recent years we have demonstrated stable organic growth
overall, particularly in the resilient light vehicle IAM, as a result of good purchasing conditions with suppliers,
network rationalization, recruitment of approximately 70 AD branded garages (net) per year from 2010 to 2019
with a churn rate of less than 5% and the disposal of non-core assets. Our model is based in part on the delivery
of value-added services to both suppliers and customers. These value-added services not only generate fees from
suppliers but also promote loyalty from customers, helping us grow our market share.

In addition, we have a strong track record of pursuing value-enhancing acquisitions and successfully
realizing synergies with such targets. In the past six years, we have made 13 sizeable acquisitions. We acquired
over €800 million in revenue through acquisitions since 2014, of which the 2014 acquisition of ACR in France
accounted for approximately €92 million, the 2016 acquisitions of Doyen Auto in the Netherlands and Automax
in France collectively accounted for approximately €174 million, the 2017 acquisitions of ADB in Belgium,
OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto in Italy and Mondial Pare-Brise in France collectively accounted for approximately
€147 million, the 2018 acquisitions of Geevers in the Netherlands, G-Group in Italy, Verviers Freins in Belgium
and Oscaro in France collectively accounted for approximately €355 million and the 2019 acquisition of AD
Bosch in Spain accounted for an annualized revenue of approximately €62 million.

Each of these acquisitions has been supported by a clear external growth strategy focused on neighboring
European countries with similar car parcs to France and targeting strong local leaders with potential to quickly
generate purchasing synergies, align interests with management, expand the reach of our operations and increase
exposure to fast-growing segments and markets. We have a strong track record of successful integrations in our
Group, and our acquisitions have demonstrated favorable pre- and post-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiples
(calculated as enterprise value divided by EBITDA) as well as our ability to grow revenue and EBITDA
following an acquisition:

   - _ACR: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as compared with post-synergy_
multiple of approximately 4x;

   - _Doyen-Auto: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 12x, as compared with post-_
synergy multiple of approximately 5x;

   - _Mondial Pare-Brise: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 9x, as compared with_
post-synergy multiple of approximately 6x; and

   - _OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 10x, as_
compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 7x.

In addition, we implemented various initiatives following our acquisition of Oscaro and brought Oscaro
back to profitability in the third quarter of the year 2019 and reaching positive EBITDA for the full year 2019.
These initiatives were part of a comprehensive turnaround plan addressing Oscaro’s key issues through increased
client communication, PR and marketing spend and the implementation of full client and suppliers overdue
payment and full customer refund plans. In addition to these immediate actions taken following the acquisition of
Oscaro, we sought to further enhance Oscaro’s profitability through purchasing synergies, supply chain and
delivery optimizations and competitive pricing. We also sought to increase Oscaro’s integration to our Group’s
culture and governance by strengthening its management team and implementing clear processes.

**_A strong financial profile delivering an attractive combination of resilient growth, margin improvement, low_**
**_capital expenditure and high cash conversion_**

We have grown our revenue from €968.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to €1.8 billion in the
year ended December 31, 2019. This reflects a CAGR of 17.0% between the years ended December 31, 2015 and
2019, with average organic growth of approximately 3.5% per annum over the 2015 to 2019 period.

We increased our Adjusted EBITDA from €83.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to
€154.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2019. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020, which illustrates the effects that acquisitions would have had if such acquisitions had taken
effect on April 1, 2019 was €219.9 million.

We operate a business model that requires a relatively low capital expenditure, using rented facilities
without needing to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the year ended December 31, 2019,
our capital expenditures amounted to 2.2% of our revenue and consisted of maintenance expenditures for our
distribution facilities and upgrades to our sales and warehouse IT management systems. Our low level of capital
expenditures has been stable in recent years, with capital expenditure for the years ended December 31, 2017,
2018 and 2019, at 2.2%, 2.2% and 2.2% of revenue, respectively (excluding Logisteo for the year ended
December 31, 2017). Our low levels of maintenance capital expenditure requirements have allowed us to invest
in our business in order to maintain our leading market positions and improve operating efficiency, as well as
achieve deleveraging through EBITDA growth and cash generation. Our cash conversion rate was 47.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with 89.9% and 50.9% in the years ended December 31, 2017 and
2018, respectively.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsor_**

We operate under the stewardship of an experienced and successful management team with a proven track
record in European B2B distribution and international expansion, coupled with a supportive sponsor. Our CEO,
Mr. Stéphane Antiglio, and CFO, Mr. Christophe Gouthière, have a proven track record in developing and
implementing turnaround and growth strategies. Mr. Stéphane Antiglio is the former CEO of Pomona Passion
Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Mr. Christophe Gouthière was previously European CFO
of the Dole Group, a leading distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our CEO and CFO are supported by an
experienced management team and, together, they have successfully implemented profit improvement initiatives
and integrated thirteen new businesses into the Group in the last seven years. For example, our management team
successfully integrated ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in 2016, realizing higher purchasing and cost savings and
revenue enhancements than those identified at the time ACR and Doyen Auto were acquired. Our management
team has also delivered consistent organic growth while expanding margins, rolling out the implementation of
Logisteo and pursuing successful expansion into new geographies, products and channels.

Additionally, our management team has implemented a comprehensive and sustainable human resources
policy aimed at achieving the right balance of a profitable business mindset, global strategy and cooperative
social environment and we were awarded the “2019 Best Employer” distinction by the French magazine Capital
in 2018. We believe that the success of our management team in completing our profit improvement plan and

117


-----

returning our business to profitable growth since 2010 has laid a solid foundation for further growth and
increased profitability. The support, investment experience and sector expertise of our sponsor, Bain Capital,
supplement the leadership and expertise of our management team.

**Our strategy**

Our strategy is to continue growing organically by leveraging our history of operational excellence that
focuses on offering a superior supplier and customer experience, to become the key consolidator in the
fragmented markets in which we operate by using our proven approach to M&A and to develop our online
segment and our position as a fully multi-channel player.

In terms of organic growth, we intend to grow revenues and continue to outperform the markets in which we
operate by continuing to apply and enhance our operational model based on a fully-integrated supply chain and
the distinctive suite of value-added digital and commercial services that we offer to our customers and suppliers.
In particular, we intend to capitalize on our value-added services in order to differentiate ourselves from our
competitors, increase customer loyalty and gain market share.

In terms of M&A-led growth, we are focused on improving Adjusted EBITDA in terms of absolute value
and Adjusted EBITDA margin. In order to do this, we put increasing focus on executing value-accretive M&A
transactions and successfully and efficiently integrating acquired businesses into the Group.

In terms of our multi-channel approach, we intend to continue to grow our online product offering in France
and in other markets and to strengthen our position in the B2C (DIY) segment.

**_Continue to reinforce our distribution models to gain market share on the French light vehicle IAM_**

In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution model for our Light Vehicle France
segment, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic investments in our automated
logistics platforms. We aim to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer service, rationalize flows and
optimize inventory and warehousing. We focus on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the regional
level, while maintaining excellent delivery times.

For example, since 2014, we have redesigned and refined our Light Vehicle France distribution model,
moving from a large number of delivery sites acting as intermediaries between suppliers and our logistics
platforms and garage customers, to a more precisely deployed network of regional pivot sites that connect
suppliers and our logistics platforms with local delivery sites, which are strategically located to address customer
demand. A key component of this strategy is our ongoing efforts to grow our affiliated network of garages. In
2017, we further enhanced our Light Vehicle France distribution model by introducing a fully automated national
logistic platform (Logisteo) that enabled same-day stock deliveries to distributors in France. Logisteo allowed us
to significantly improve our distribution model by increasing the consolidation of our supply flows to a single
delivery point from 18% in 2014 to 64% in 2018 resulting in approximately 30% gain in productivity.

We expect that our new model will further improve distributor performance with optimized inventory levels
and SKU availability and an increased ability to adapt our offer to local customer requirements, leading to an
enhanced customer experience. We continue to seek ways to optimize our operations and business model to
further improve delivery times, quality of service and availability of products, each of which are expected to
help us gain greater market share in the geographies where we operate.

**_Increase exposure to higher growth businesses_**

In recent years, we have undertaken specific steps to focus on and penetrate superior growth businesses in
the aftermarket spare parts distribution market: online web dealers, body parts and windshields. We have
developed our online presence with external web dealers through the acquisitions of ACR and Doyen Auto, two
platforms focused on web dealers, to become their expert distribution partner. We believe that business with web
dealers present superior growth opportunities, and we intend to further increase our exposure to these customers
in the coming years. For example, we established a key account unit between ACR and Doyen Auto to focus on
web dealers. Our strategic partnership with Oscaro, launched in 2013, was also part of this strategy. We then
increased our presence in the online distribution business when we acquired Oscaro in November 2018, and we
have engaged in a strategic plan to become a European leader in online automotive spare parts by consolidating
our position in France and in Western Europe, mainly Spain, Belgium and Italy, with a focus on EBITDA
generation.

118


-----

We also believe that the body parts and windshield segment represents a high growth business. Following
significant market share gains in this segment, we invested in the development of the Cora distribution platform
in France and in 2018 completed the acquisition of Geevers, a body parts specialist in the Netherlands. We also
entered the windshield segment through our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise in 2017, a retail business focused
on glazing repair, and have focused on the development of a sizeable presence in France, reaching 324
workshops in 2018. We intend to expand the reach of our current platforms and develop a distribution service to
external glazing repair players by leveraging our scale and purchase expertise. In addition, we intend to pursue
the development of Mondial Pare-Brise, aiming to add 15 Urban Master Centers in large cities in France by
2025.

**_Continue to improve our purchasing, pricing and logistics capabilities_**

We intend to continue to leverage the strength of our CPU by increasing the share of purchases from
referenced suppliers, notably from acquired companies outside of France. We aim to pursue the optimization of
our supplier relationships and to further improve purchasing terms with our growing negotiating power due to
our European scale and our optimized logistics, while maintaining a sufficient number of suppliers to avoid
undue reliance on any particular suppliers. We also see further opportunities to concentrate our supply flows and
plan to select no more than two or three suppliers per product or sub-category of product in the near future. We
expect that this strategy will continue to improve product availability and profitability.

In addition, we intend to continue expanding our private label offerings, by deepening our sourcing in Asia
while maintaining high quality standards. We also intend to introduce private label offerings in our acquired
businesses and ensure supplier concentration. Our expansion strategy for our private label offerings is expected
to optimize production costs, while increasing volumes sold per SKU and allowing us to negotiate improved
purchasing conditions with the suppliers of these products, in turn leading to profitable growth through margin
expansion.

**_Reinforce cost efficiency initiatives at both local distribution and central and administrative levels_**

We operate a fully-integrated supply chain that connects our strategically concentrated group of suppliers to
our CPUs and state-of-the-art logistics platforms, through to an extensive distribution network that serves more
than 70,000 customers with deliveries several times per day and with best-in-class delivery times. We intend to
build on our history of operational excellence by continuing to integrate and rationalize our supply chain to
improve cost efficiency. We believe this approach will help us maintain and further enhance our strong and
unique positioning as a central distribution intermediary for all value chain levels and to reinforce our role as an
important link between parts suppliers and customers. Based on the value that we have extracted from
operational improvements in recent years, we believe that continual improvements to our supply chain will
contribute to increased market share and expanded margins. For example, our increasing use of centralized,
automated platforms simplifies the delivery processes for our suppliers by offering them a single delivery point.
We also offer suppliers a range of innovative value-added services such as marketing tools and intelligence,
online support tools, payment guarantees and a centralized invoicing system with simplified back office support,
all of which help suppliers grow their own business while creating greater efficiencies through simplified
tracking, delivery, monitoring and payment solutions. We believe that these services represent advantages that
are a “win-win” proposition for us and our suppliers, differentiating us from our competitors.

We are also pursuing increased integration of our supply chain, which is based on two flows of spare parts:
a “direct delivery flow” from suppliers to distributors and a “platform-based flow” through our logistics
platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2019, 64% of our products were distributed via our logistics platform,
as compared with 18% in 2010, representing an improvement that we intend to pursue by further developing our
platform-based flow. This approach is expected to improve product availability and delivery times while being
cost efficient and generating favorable financial conditions for us, due in part to the higher logistics fees which
we can apply in this context, and which we expect will lead to higher margins, as the logistics fees received from
suppliers generally exceed the related costs of operating the logistics platforms. In particular, our new, automated
platforms, such as Logisteo, generally offer a doubled capacity for SKUs as well as doubled processing capacity,
allowing us to offer more SKUs from a wider range of product lines and suppliers. We will pursue this strategy
by encouraging new suppliers to make deliveries through the platform flow from the outset as well as by having
existing supplies expand the breadth of their range offered through our platform-based flow.

In addition, we believe that our extensive distribution network is a key part to our success. We employ a
cost-conscious approach to manage our distribution network, constantly focusing on improving network

119


-----

efficiency and coverage, while minimizing or eliminating redundancies wherever possible. For example, in our
Light Vehicle France segment, we are currently focused on ongoing upgrades to our real estate parc and
improvements to the size and coverage of our footprint of distribution sites in France. When and where
necessary, we remodel, close or consolidate sites. We also work to lower and rationalize downstream logistics
costs by maximizing the square footage of our sites and by modernizing our logistics and monitoring functions,
such as through the increased use of bar coding and the creation of a dedicated logistics department. In our
Trucks segment, we are implementing an improvement plan that is focused on closing low- and non-performing
sites in the context of a broader profit-focused effort to optimize our distribution network.

**_Pursue the consolidation of Western Europe markets via targeted acquisitions and diversify our presence in_**
**_existing markets by leveraging our integration track record to deliver maximum profitability potential_**

In recent years, we have implemented a number of successful acquisitions, demonstrating the strength and
discipline of our M&A process. This M&A process is centered around careful evaluation of potential targets,
which are usually selected from local leaders that offer significant purchasing synergies. Through strategic
acquisitions, we have penetrated new geographies, for example through our acquisitions of Doyen Auto and AD
Bosch, which allowed us to expand into Benelux and Spain, respectively, as well as broaden our reach or product
offering in the countries in which we already operate, for example through our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise,
which allowed us to offer a full range of windscreen replacement products in France. In addition, through the
acquisition of Oscaro in France, we have penetrated the B2C (DIY) segment and strengthened our position in the
e-commerce market. We intend to leverage our market knowledge to continue to roll-out Oscaro to our markets
outside of France.

We intend to continue making strategic, value-accretive acquisitions in the short and the medium term,
including in certain geographies adjacent to the countries in which we operate. We intend to focus on new
geographies where the car parcs are similar enough to those in which we are already active to realize synergies
and where we can effectively use our logistics platforms and distribution networks.

We also intend to consolidate our leadership in the countries where we are already present, building on areas
of strength and taking advantage of the fragmented nature of these markets. We believe that the consolidation of
these markets will accelerate following the COVID-19 crisis, driven by small players that we believe are likely to
have been impacted by liquidity constraints to a greater extent than ourselves. We further intend to leverage our
expertise in our Light Vehicle France segment to expand and diversify our presence in other countries by
undertaking proven successful initiatives. For example, we are in the process of strengthening the
Autodistribution brand in Belgium and the Netherlands, expanding our product range in Italy, notably in our
private label offerings and body part product range, and growing our online penetration with high-momentum
customers such as web dealers in Belgium.

**_Build on Oscaro’s successful turnaround to deliver strong and profitable growth_**

Our digital services are a key factor that differentiate us from our competitors. We intend to continue
growing our digital offering in order to capitalize on this competitive advantage. Following the strategic
acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, the leading online seller of light vehicle spare parts in France, we
implemented a comprehensive turnaround plan which allowed us to bring Oscaro back to profitability in the third
quarter of 2019, strengthened our online distribution channel and allowed us to become an “omni-channel”
aftermarket spare parts distributor in France. We estimate that the full year effect of the acquisition of Oscaro
would represent a contribution to our Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of approximately €21 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019, after taking into account the run-rate impact of our turnaround plan for Oscaro
already completed (approximately €7 million) and of additional cost optimization measures and purchasing
synergies to be implemented (approximately €10 million), including overhead and supply chain cost reduction
and new growth initiatives.

We intend to build on Oscaro’s successful turnaround to deliver our online growth strategy and become a
leading European auto parts online retailer with sustainable margins by 2025. Our strategy consists in
strengthening Oscaro’s position in France by reinforcing its position on current categories, developing new
categories, such as commercial vehicles, and by improving the customer experience through the website but also
with a better customer service throughout the delivery chain. We also intend to improve Oscaro’s profitability by
optimizing supply chain costs and leveraging our scale. Furthermore, we also intend to expand Oscaro’s presence
internationally by capturing profitable growth in Spain and Belgium and launching local websites in Germany,
Italy and the Netherlands, starting in 2021. Finally, we intend to support Oscaro’s strategic development plan by

120


-----

implementing several IT initiatives such as the introduction of an advanced CRM, the improvement of financial
flows traceability and reporting and the setting-up of middle office capabilities.

**_Finalize operational transformation to consolidate our leading position in the Trucks segment and increase_**
**_our margins_**

We are focused on operational improvements in our Trucks segment and we have finalized the
implementation of a new distribution model in 2019 which allowed us to grow our network of affiliated garages
and to reorganize our former network of 125 distribution sites around 10 regional warehouses focused on
distribution to local sites, owned and independent garages and integrated workshops. As a result of this
reorganization, we are better able to utilize our large network and unique range of value-added services to meet
customer demand. We also became the only player in the French truck spare parts aftermarket that is able to
serve customers with two daily deliveries made within four hours.

We intend to further consolidate our leading position in the Trucks segment and increase our margins in this
business. We aim to expand the coverage of our AD Poids Lourds network to 250 repair service and distribution
sites by 2025. In addition, we intend to introduce new products and services and focus on key accounts while
undertaking targeted pricing initiatives. Finally, a key element of our strategy is the ongoing implementation of
our new distribution model to improve efficiency and customer service in our Truck segment. We believe that
these measures will allow us to consolidate our leading position in the Trucks segment and increase our margins.

**_Maintain a positive social environment to recruit and retain talent by focusing on development opportunities_**

We believe that attracting and retaining talented people is critical to our success and believe that the key to
attracting and retaining talented employees is offering development and growth opportunities in the context of a
positive social environment. We have focused our management strategy on achieving the right balance of a
profitable business mindset, a global strategy and a cooperative social climate. We intend to maintain our strong
corporate culture with a human resources strategy that focuses on creating and sustaining an experienced,
motivated and stable workforce. In order to do this, our human resources strategy is, and will continue to be,
organized around four pillars: (i) successful talent recruitment, supported by marketing events, educational
collaborations and digital initiatives, (ii) development of employees through training partnerships, e-learning and
talent appraisal and evaluation processes, (iii) a cost-efficient approach to benefits through payroll monitoring,
unified compensation policies, profit sharing mechanisms and favorable social protection schemes and (iv) the
development of a positive social environment through automation, continuous improvement of working
conditions, investments in work spaces and workforce rationalization.

**History**

We were founded in 1962 to formalize the cooperation among a number of existing independent light
vehicle aftermarket distributors and quickly became a key operator in France, providing a link between original
equipment suppliers and spare parts suppliers on the one hand, and garages, local spare parts distributors, body
shops, fast-fitters and car centers on the other hand. In 1983, we expanded our footprint throughout France, both
at the distributor level and the garage level, by forming our network of wholly-owned distributors and in 1985,
rolling out our concept of a network of branded garages that comprised key customers that operate independently
from the Group. We launched our truck business in 1988 to supply spare parts for trucks, tractors and trailers. We
were the first independent distributor network of spare parts for trucks in France.

We have continued expanding our logistics platforms, distribution network and our products and services
offering in France through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. For example, we enhanced our logistics
platforms and expanded our offering to include body parts through the acquisitions of Cora, a leading
independent French distributor of light vehicle parts for collision repair in 2005, and Bremstar, a distributor with
a logistics platform dedicated to truck parts for maintenance and repair, in 2008. Between 2012 and 2017, we
acquired a number of French light vehicle and truck distributors including Gobillot Rhône (previously
Ensemble), FPLS, Rougon Queyrel, Electro Diesel Service, ADB, API Marne, API Aube and acquired a minority
stake in Société Lyonnaise de Pneumatiques et Accessoires. In 2017, we purchased Mondial Pare-Brise, a French
auto glass repair network expanding into a product range that complements our existing offering and in 2018 we
purchased Oscaro, a French online distributor of light vehicle spare parts. We also distribute our own private
label product offerings, ISOTECH (rolled out in 2001), Requal and Xenergy, which feature spare parts, such as
batteries, brake pads, lubricants, water pumps and headlights.

We have also expanded into complementary channels and to address new customer bases. For example, we
have progressively enhanced our online offering. We created the Autossimo online B2B light vehicle repair and

121


-----

maintenance web portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online B2B truck repair and maintenance web portal in
2001. As another example, in 2014, we acquired ACR, a specialized distributor in France of light vehicle spare
parts and, in 2016, Doyen Auto, a Belgium-headquartered distributor of aftermarket light vehicle spare parts,
enabling us to become a leading distributor to online players, and to expand our platform to serve our key
customers. We also created www.idgarages.com, which allows customers to locate and compare garages and
schedule service appointments online, and has led to the development of our relationships with web dealers.

We also have a history of successfully acquiring and integrating strategic targets in adjacent geographic
markets. In 2007, our previous shareholder introduced the business into the Polish market by purchasing three
local distributors that operated as the key distributors for our Polish subsidiary, AD Polska. In August 2017, our
current management made a strategic exit from the Polish market as part of our network rationalization strategy,
divesting AD Polska to Rhiag Group. In 2017, we entered the Italian market with the creation of a joint company,
Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., with three Italian distributors, OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto, and in 2018, we
acquired G-Group, an independent spare parts distributor in Italy. In 2016, we acquired the Doyen Auto Group,
allowing us to expand into Benelux and in 2018 we acquired Geevers and Verviers Freins, further expanding our
operations in Benelux. In 2019, we acquired a 75.10% stake in AD Bosch for a consideration of €48.1 million
which enabled us to enter the Spanish market. AD Bosch is a leading B2B independent spare parts distributor in
Catalonia with approximately 27 sites as of December 2019. AD Bosch is one of the largest members of AD
Parts, a leading independent auto parts network of purchasing, distribution, manufacturing and services in Iberia
that regroups approximately 27 independent affiliated distributors. AD Parts comprises approximately 490
distribution centers in Spain and Portugal and has historically demonstrated a strong growth track record, gaining
market share from its competitors.

We have also developed and implemented operating strategies designed to increase our revenue, reduce our
leverage, costs and capital expenditures and improve margins. These strategies include the introduction of a new
management team in 2010, the implementation of a profit improvement plan, the revision of distributor margins
and the rollout of fully-integrated logistics platforms such as Logisteo. For example, we have revisited our
previous centralized approach and have now implemented a transparent model with a rationalized distribution
network, which has led to higher customer loyalty.

We were acquired by our current principal shareholder, Bain Capital, in 2015. Since 2015, we have
diversified and internationalized our business with new product and channel offerings and expansions into
adjacent geographies.

**Our operational model**

**_Procurement and suppliers_**

Our procurement strategy is organized around suppliers, our CPUs and our private label offerings,
ISOTECH, Requal and Xenergy.

_Central purchasing units_

Our CPUs buy aftermarket spare parts, equipment and tools from suppliers. We use our CPUs to monitor
customer purchases across our network and to adjust our product portfolio in order to meet customer demand.
We seek to buy in large quantities so that the savings made by buying in bulk offset the costs associated with
maintaining inventories at our warehouses.

_Suppliers_

Our key suppliers are OESs. We have cultivated long-term relationships with most of our suppliers. Our
suppliers are geographically diversified, based across France (Valeo), Italy (Filtrauto), Germany (Bosch, KnorrBremse and Schaeffler), Sweden (SKF) and the United States (Gates, Tenneco and TRW Automotive). This
approach to sourcing allows us to cover the full portfolio of products that our customers seek, while retaining
control over our relationships with suppliers and optimizing our sourcing across multiple countries.

Our leading market position, large-scale operations, large purchasing volumes and centralized purchasing
approach provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates and fees with
our suppliers. These rebates and fees lower the purchase price we pay by 15% to 20% and include service and
logistics fees charged by us to suppliers as well as end-of-year volume rebates, strategic rebates and AD
International rebates applied by suppliers. For example, our logistical capabilities enable suppliers to make

122


-----

deliveries to a single point, allowing us to charge suppliers logistics fees which are generally greater than the
logistics costs that we incur. Moreover, we benefit from a competitive pricing policy in relation to suppliers, the
price of spare parts being indexed to that of equivalent OEM spare parts and thus reflecting inflation.

Suppliers also benefit from their relationship with us, which provides them with increased volumes and
offers a number of value-added services, in exchange for a fee, as well as unique access to our customer base.
The fees paid by suppliers constitute approximately 15% to 21% of the total fees received from suppliers

The services that we offer to our suppliers are focused on improving these suppliers’ efficiency and
promoting their products and include:

   - Marketing tools: we offer information about suppliers’ products to customers and promote suppliers’
products, including in connection with new product launches.

   - Online support: we include references to suppliers’ products in our online portals (such as Autossimo,
Truckissimo and Salto), which help increase brand and product awareness for suppliers and generate
orders.

   - Invoicing and back-office support: we offer a central ordering, purchasing and invoicing system and
suppliers benefit from having a single invoicing counterparty and from payment guarantees.

   - Market intelligence: we give suppliers access to our market data.

In addition to the services described above, we also give our suppliers access to ADI, a purchasing group of
aftermarket distributors, which we founded. ADI has 24 members, of which we are the leader, accounting for
23% of purchases, while the second largest member accounts for 21% of purchases. In 2019, ADI generated
€6.9 billion in revenue and was present in 40 countries. ADI works with 40 suppliers, 415 distributors (who have
access to 2,891 distribution outlets) and 9,900 AD-branded garages across 20 countries. ADI benefits members
by giving them enhanced negotiating power with major suppliers, allowing them to operate under a common
brand, enabling them to share know-how and offering support services such as diagnostic tools and a technical
hotline. ADI benefits suppliers by giving them access to an international network of distributors with high sales
volumes and extensive customer coverage, giving such suppliers high levels of visibility into the market.

In 2019, we worked with 260 main suppliers (as compared with 293 suppliers in 2010) and our top ten
suppliers provided approximately 50% of our products by volume (as compared with 35% in 2010). In 2019, our
top three suppliers provided 26% of our products by volume and no supplier other than the top three suppliers
provided more than 5% of our products by volume. We are one of the top three clients of Bosch, Schaeffler and
Federal Mogul and are Filtrauto’s number one client.

We select our suppliers via tender procedures for each product category that we distribute. When selecting
our suppliers, we take into account the quality and price of the spare parts or products, as well as the supplier’s
ability to deliver items within the deadlines required. For example, we select our brake and battery suppliers
every three years. We generally enter into annually renewable contracts with our suppliers, which include
standard terms and conditions, such as supply specifications regarding lead time, frequency of deliveries,
packaging and performance target and rebates.

_Private label offerings_

In addition to our procurement activities described above, we distribute products from our own private label
offerings, ISOTECH, Requal and Xenergy, whom we source from manufacturers to which we subcontract
production.

ISOTECH is a high quality product line we relaunched in 2008 to cover the French market, which offered
approximately 3,500 SKUs for the light vehicle aftermarket as well as truck parts for maintenance and repair in
2019. ISOTECH’s product offering is focused on the older part of the car parc and truck fleet (i.e. vehicles aged
over eight years) and ISOTECH’s offering is comprehensive, covering most of the needs of the car parc. We
offer competitive pricing on ISOTECH products to customers by giving a discount to prevailing market prices.
Despite these lower prices, we benefit from more attractive margins on ISOTECH products as compared with
third-party branded products. Additionally, the ISOTECH product line serves a strategic response to certain of
the pricing pressures created by web dealers. The penetration rate of the ISOTECH offering has been growing
steadily. In 2015, we expanded the ISOTECH offering to include equipment, which we source from Asia, while
carefully monitoring product quality and lead times. Revenue from ISOTECH equipment has grown substantially
since the creation of the offering, reaching €5.0 million in 2019 compared to €0.6 million in 2015. In 2019,
ISOTECH products represented approximately 5% of our total sales and approximately 9% of our light vehicle
sales in France.

123


-----

Requal is a product line of light vehicle spare parts, such as brake pads and wiper parts, that is focused on
price-competitive products for cars aged four years and older and that covers the Benelux market. We acquired
the Requal brand in connection with our acquisition of the Doyen Auto Group in 2016.

Xenergy is our private label covering the Italian market that is CE certified, composed of these 9 family
products: Brakes, Shock absorbers, Batteries, Bulbs, Alternators / Starters, Wipers, Water pumps, Filters,
Lubricants. Xenergy has now reached €8 million of annual turnover with an average margin of 40%.

**_Upstream logistics control_**

The flow of products purchased by our CPUs is mainly managed by our logistics platforms. Our upstream
logistics control model is state-of-the-art, featuring automated central warehouses that have enabled us to reduce
costs while improving product availability and delivery times. Our logistics platforms have the following key
responsibilities:

   - _Inbound logistics: accepting incoming products from suppliers and monitoring compliance with_
negotiated specifications.

   - _Stocking: determining the shelf space to be allocated to each product and shelf placement in accordance_
with turnover indices and product size. The proper placement of products within the dedicated space is
crucial to optimize available space.

   - _Picking, packing and outbound logistics: space management allows us to maximize efficiency in_
locating and retrieving products from the shelves and assembling orders of outgoing products. If
products have not been previously packaged by the suppliers, our logistics platforms are able to carry
out this activity.

   - _Shipping: organizing and monitoring transportation._

Our logistical operations include two flows of spare parts: a direct delivery flow from suppliers to
distributors and a platform-based flow through our logistics platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2019,
64% of our products were distributed via our platform-based flow, as compared to 18% in 2010. Our strategy is
to further develop the platform-based flow because it drives improved product availability and delivery times and
leads to favorable financial conditions for us, such as higher logistics fees applied by our suppliers.

The transport of products from our logistics platforms to our distribution network is carried out through
independent carriers. Our logistics department is responsible for setting performance targets and related
incentives and penalties for third-party carriers, while continuously monitoring the performance of carriers in
order to improve customer service. We plan and monitor product flows through our IT systems. We lease, rather
than own, most of our logistics platforms, thereby limiting our permanent investment in fixed assets.

Our Light Vehicle France segment is serviced by three logistics platforms: Logisteo (our automated
warehouse), ACR (focused on key accounts and online customers) and Cora (focused on light vehicle body parts
for collision repair). Our Light Vehicle International segment is serviced by different logistics platforms: Doyen
Auto and Geevers (covering Belgium and the Netherlands as well as certain online customers), OVAM/Ricauto
and G-Group for body parts (covering Italy) and AD Bosch (covering Spain). Our Trucks segment is serviced by
one logistics platform, Bremstar.

**_Local distribution_**

Our local distribution model includes wholly-owned distributors (“wholly-owned distributors”) and
independent distributors affiliated with us (“affiliated independent distributors”), as well as local wholesalers
who are not affiliated with us and online players.

Our distribution network in France is dense and allows us to offer customers premium solutions and
services. In the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket, our dense distribution network enables us to
keep products close to customers and make up to six deliveries per day to most customers. As a result,
distributors are able to provide their customers with best-in-class delivery lead times, with deliveries to garages
generally able to be made in under two hours when necessary, deliveries to key accounts generally able to be
made in under two hours when necessary or one business day and deliveries to web dealers generally able to be
made within four hours or one business day. The density of our local distribution network also gives us the
ability to negotiate with key accounts at a national level.

The map below shows our distribution locations in France, with a focus on the French Alps region to
demonstrate how we deploy a mix of regional hubs, local distribution sites and proximity collection sites.

As of December 31, 2019, we operated a network of 31 wholly-owned distributors and 53 affiliated
independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out of approximately 487 owned and affiliated
distribution locations as of December 31, 2019, overall, making us the largest independent single-branded light
vehicle spare parts distribution network in France and enabling us to cover 90% of customer demand and 90% of
spare parts.

Our contractual arrangements with our affiliated independent distributors include agreements and
commercial contracts, which are negotiated every seven years and which were last renewed on April 13, 2015.
Pursuant to our affiliation agreements, our affiliated independent distributors agree to operate under the
Autodistribution brand and to receive our support services in exchange for a membership fee. Our CPUs enter
into commercial contracts with both our wholly-owned distributors and our affiliated independent distributors,
which include the same purchase conditions and volume discounts for both affiliated independent distributors
and wholly-owned distributors. Our affiliated independent distributors receive a loyalty bonus if the purchases
made through our CPUs account for at least 84% of their overall purchase volumes, with an average of almost
90% of affiliated independent distributor purchases being made through our CPUs in 2019. Additionally, we pass
on a portion of the rebates we receive from suppliers to our affiliated independent distributors and our whollyowned distributors pass on a portion of the rebates to the garages to which they sell. Our wholly-owned and
affiliated independent distributors also benefit from belonging to a single brand. We involve our wholly-owned
and affiliated independent distributors in governance and decision-making through an annual steering committee.

In recent years, we have redesigned our Light Vehicle France distribution model to improve our operational
efficiency, enhance customer service, cover multiple regions with small regional platforms (“pivot sites”),
rationalize flows and optimize inventory and warehousing, focusing on offering higher availability of more SKUs
at the regional level and with excellent delivery times.

125


-----

The graphic below compares our Light Vehicle France distribution model as it operated before 2014 with
our current distribution model. This new model leads to the consolidation of supplies in a single delivery point,
from 17% in 2010 to 64% in 2020, and therefore generating lower suppliers transport costs and overall serving
costs, which are shared between the Group and its suppliers.

We are currently making similar changes to the management strategy and distribution model in our Trucks
segment. We have reduced our number of truck spare parts distribution regions to seven (as compared with ten in
2016), by closing certain loss-making locations and merging other locations in order to reduce overlaps. We are
in the process of expanding our AD Poids Lourds-branded garages, having recruited 110 AD Poids Lourds on
2019, with the objective of reaching 250 distribution and repair sites, including 150 AD Poids Lourds garages, by
2025. We are also working to rationalize our AD Poids Lourds network by closing certain loss-making locations
and merging other locations in order to reduce overlaps.

In addition, we are also in the process of redesigning our truck spare parts distribution model, with ten
platforms already deployed and three more expected to be deployed by the end of 2020. The graphic below
compares our truck spare parts distribution model as it operated before 2017 with the distribution model that is
being implemented.

Our new truck spare parts distribution model has increased the number of regional warehouses to 10 as of
December 31, 2019 (as compared to six in 2017), leading to higher product availability at regional level, stocking
25,000 SKUs exclusively for trucks.

126


-----

The redesign of our distribution models is part of a larger project that we have undertaken to modernize our
networks. Other components of this effort include the rationalization and upgrading of our real estate parc, with
the consolidation of the number of locations to 228 in 2019 (excluding recently opened proximity, OTC
locations) (as compared to 230 locations in 2014) and the rationalization of our storage capacity (from
approximately 356,000 square meters in 2014 to approximately 335,000 square meters in 2017), the
modernization of our logistics platforms, with 100% of our platforms now using bar codes for inventory
management and the creation of a dedicated logistics department, and the modernization of our monitoring
systems, with the implementation of performance and operational indicators. The efforts have had a positive
impact, as evidenced by an increase in revenue per employee (from €225,000 per employee in 2014 to €245,000
per employee in 2019).

**_Customers_**

Our local distribution networks distribute parts, equipment and tools to our light vehicle customers,
including garages, body shops, fast-fitters, online operators and integrated workshops, some of which we are
affiliated with (but, in the case of our light vehicle activities, not owned by us) and operate under our brands
(“branded garages”) and others of which are independent (with no formal affiliation with us and sometimes
affiliated with an OEM), as well as our key accounts. Our truck spare parts distribution customers are garages,
certified repairers/agents, integrated workshops and key accounts. Our truck repair and maintenance customers,
served through our wholly-owned garages, are truck fleet owners and operators and integrated workshops.

In 2019, we distributed products to 62,846 regular professional customers in France. As of December 31,
2019, there were 3,673 branded garages in our customer network. In 2019, garages represented 38% of our
customer base, followed by wholesalers (27%), retail (21%), online (2%), key accounts (5%). Other customers
represented 7% of our customer base in 2019.

Our principal customers are garages. We distribute products to independent garages (including those that are
affiliated with OEMs) as well as to the AD-branded garages, including AD Expert (with approximately 1,394
points of sale in 2019), AD Poids Lourds (with approximately 228 points of sale in 2019, of which 70 were
wholly-owned by us), AD Carrosserie (primarily serving independent body shops, with approximately 678 points
of sale in 2019), Auto Primo (primarily serving rural and semi-rural repair shops, with approximately 1,039
points of sale in 2019) and Mondial Pare-Brise (offering auto glass repair at approximately 326 locations in
2019).

We enter into agreements with independent garages, pursuant to which they become AD-branded garages
and receive enhanced service and support from us in exchange for a membership fee and our wholly-owned and
affiliated independent distributors are designated as their preferred distributors of spare parts. Our branded
garages in our light vehicle activities are not owned by us. Joining the AD brand allows garages to remain
independent while gaining the benefit of accessing our services and the commercial terms that we have
negotiated with suppliers.

127


-----

We also benefit from our network of branded garages, which made us the largest and the fastest growing
light vehicle garage network in France in 2017 after PSA, during the years 2014 to 2018, as shown in the graphic
below.

Our total network included approximately 4,000 branded and affiliated garages in 2019, of which 3,156
were in France and the remainder were in Benelux, Italy and Spain. Additionally, our network of branded
garages provides us with a reliable source of orders since branded garages agree to purchase a minimum amount
(generally 70%) of their products from us per year and also pay fees to us in exchange for certain value-added
services.

We also distribute products to retail and other outlets such as Midas, Euromaster and Speedy and to certain
“key accounts” that have a national presence (such as Feu Vert, Norauto and Auto 5). Our key accounts represent
an increasing share of our revenue. In 2014, sales to key accounts represented €44 million of our revenue and in
2019, they represented €45.6 million of our revenue. We also distribute our products to web dealers (such as
Mister Auto). Our sales to web dealers account for an increasing share of our revenue.

We offer a one-stop-shop scheme designed to match our customers’ needs, which vary according to
customer type. For example, our garage customers, focused on maintenance and body parts, rely on distributors
because they need to be able to provide services quickly to their customers, which requires them to offer a large
and diversified product portfolio that can be supplied quickly, while holding little to no inventory. Providing the
right part at the right place and right time is therefore critical to meeting our garage customers’ needs and we
offer a distribution model based on proximity. Garages also need technical support with diagnostics,
identification of parts and repair methods and the ordering of tools, and often require frequent training, as spare
parts become more complex. We provide these services, replicating the types of programs that OEMs provide to
their own networks, but expanding these services across the full range of light vehicles. Our online customers and
key accounts have similar needs to those of garages: supplying their customers quickly with a large product
assortment while having little to no capacity for inventory and storage. We meet these needs by offering up to
two deliveries a day, with some deliveries undertaken within two hours of the order placement, through two
dedicated logistics platforms, ACR and Doyen Auto.

Customers generally select spare parts suppliers and distributors based on a number of factors, including
product range and availability, service offering, price and services. Our distribution model, combined with the
services we offer, is designed to match customers’ needs, leading to customer loyalty.

Our services include:

   - _Best-in-class delivery times: Through our automated warehouses, we make deliveries to our customers_
up to six times per day and delivery times for some products can be as short as two to four hours from
the time of order, with many other products being delivered within one day.

   - _Commercial support: Our service is strengthened by our partnership with the IDRAC business school,_
which helps select and integrate new sales teams, notably via apprenticeships. We created a tabletbased “e-book” that customers can use to view product details and instructional and support videos. We
also provide customer service through our “Assistance Diag” call centers, which handled
approximately 80 calls per day in 2019 for our 1,500 key users. Assistance Diag addresses 95% of the
products we distribute and 450,000 technical issues, with nine hotlines that are specialized by
carmakers.

   - _Training and technical support: We offer a range of technical support services to our customers,_
including, for example, a multi-brand diagnostic tool, Diag’issimo, which helps customers identify the
source of product and systems breakdowns. We also offer comprehensive training opportunities. For
example, our customers can benefit from dedicated training modules through “AD Academy.” In 2017,
we acquired Grup Eina, a company based in Spain with call centers and staff dedicated to the French
market, in order to enhance our digital support and training offerings, with practical trainings that
address the increasing complexity of car maintenance, including simulations of data systems
breakdowns.

   - _Strong commercial concept and integrated branding: Another key differentiating feature is our strong_
commercial concept and integrated branding. Our brands benefit from strong brand awareness among
drivers. For example, according to an independent third-party survey conducted in France in 2017, the
“Autodistribution” brand enjoys the highest brand awareness among our peers, with 92% brand
awareness (of which, unprompted awareness of 74% and prompted awareness of 18%). The second
ranking player in France had only 37% brand awareness.

   - _Business leads to key third-party providers: We partner with certain third-party providers, such as_
major insurers (such as Allianz, MAAF, Macif and AXA) and car fleets (such as AVIS, Europcar and
Eiffage), which helps drive B2C (DIY) sales within our repairer customers’ networks. We manage
these partnerships with four dedicated teams, employing 40 people, and, in 2019, handled
approximately 500,000 requests, leading to approximately 40,000 services. We estimate that such
partnerships drove approximately €278 million in business to our AD-branded garages and Mondial
Pare-Brise customers in 2019.

   - _Online tools: We have developed online tools to support our customers with online ordering as well as_
other IT functions. For example, our proprietary online portal, Autossimo, processed more than 5,000
product orders per day in 2019. Autossimo improves customers’ experiences by offering a userfriendly portal for garages to search through a large selection of spare parts, directly order parts online
and obtain technical information about those parts. Autossimo features approximately 2.48 million
parts in our catalogue, supplied by 600 OEMs/OESs. In 2019, one-third of French garages were
Autossimo customers and 24% of our orders were placed online (as compared with 12% in 2014).

We also created ID Garages, which allows drivers to get a quote and schedule a service appointment online,
driving business to our branded garages. We believe ID Garages are a “win-win” solution for us, allowing us to
retain a percentage of the fee quote, and our suppliers and garages to collect fees from business gained through
the portal. In 2019, ID Garages served more than 3,800 subscribers and 6 million unique web visitors, with an
average of 4,500 bookings made per month via this portal in the fourth quarter of 2019. We estimate that ID
Garages generated approximately €2.4 million in subscriptions and fees and drove approximately €8.0 million
worth of business to our garage customers for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Our operational segments**

**_Light Vehicle France_**

The Light Vehicle France segment is our historical core activity, generating revenues of €910.7 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019, and distributing light vehicle spare parts and products to garages, body shops,
fast-fitters, online operators and integrated workshops. We have grown our light vehicle France segment
organically and with strategic acquisitions such as the acquisitions of Gobillot Rhône (2012), Rougon Queyrel
and FPLS (2013), ACR (2014) and Mondial Pare-Brise and Oocar (2017).

-----

In 2017, we had approximately 335,000 square meters of light vehicle spare parts storage capacity in
France. In 2019, we were able to stock approximately 4,500,000 SKUs representing approximately 1,600 brands.
Our light vehicle France network included 84 distributors and 3,156 branded and affiliated garages. For the year
ended December 31, 2019, sales to light vehicle France Affiliated Distributors constituted 42% of the total light
vehicle France sales. Furthermore, in 2019, branded garages represented more than 34.5% of the sales made by
light vehicle France, followed by retail (approximately 12%), web dealers (approximately 1%) and key accounts
(approximately 6%). Our light vehicle France distribution network in Benelux makes up to six deliveries per day,
with delivery times as low as two hours.

Our light vehicle France segment is supported by three logistics platforms: Logisteo, ACR and Cora.

   - Logisteo is our automated warehouse. It is a central platform that enables stock deliveries to French
distributors once per day. Logisteo is located in Réau, France and represented a total cost of
€26 million as of December 31, 2019. As of 2019, it was the largest independent logistics platform for
light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France. It has over 38,000 square meters of storage
space and stores approximately 120,000 SKUs (as compared with storage of approximately 55,000
SKUs before the implementation of Logisteo). Logisteo prepares approximately 60,000 lines per day
(as compared with approximately 30,000 lines per day before the implementation of Logisteo) and
completes approximately 3,000 orders per hour, serving approximately 500 local distributors. We
estimate that Logisteo has driven a 30% improvement in productivity and that Logisteo supplies
virtually all of our French light vehicle distribution locations and employs approximately 200 full-time
employees (as of December 31, 2019, a reduction of approximately 100 full-time employees since the
inception of Logisteo). Deliveries of regular orders are made before 8:00 a.m. arrive the next business
day. Logisteo has also enabled us to consolidate our supply flows to a single delivery point, which
permits us to offer a wide-range of constantly available products while capturing logistics fees from
our suppliers that generally exceed our logistics costs, generating higher margins.

   - ACR is a specialized, automated platform that services our key accounts and online customers in
France, with stock deliveries of light vehicle spare parts made two times per day and emergency
deliveries made to wholesalers as needed. Deliveries of regular orders are made within four hours.
ACR was established in 2010 and was acquired by us in 2014. It has approximately 30,000 square
meters of storage space at nine regional locations across France and a central platform in Gennevilliers,
France and stocked approximately 100,000 SKUs in total.

   - Cora is our specialized, partially automated platform for light vehicle body parts for collision repair in
France. Cora was established in 1967 and was acquired by us in 2005. Cora operates from our hub in
Chaponnay, France. It has approximately 35,000 square meters of storage space and stores
approximately 84,000 SKUs. Deliveries of regular orders are made within one business day.

**_Light Vehicle International_**

Our Light Vehicle International segment generated revenues of €461.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019, and is supported by two partially automated logistics platforms: Doyen Auto and OVAM/
Ricauto. Collectively, they have approximately 60,000 square meters of storage space and stock approximately
100,000 SKUs.

_Benelux_

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 37,000 square meters of storage capacity in Benelux that
stocked approximately 90,000 SKUs representing more than 79 brands. Our network in Benelux included 409
distributors, including 98 Doyen Auto franchisees, more than 207 “1, 2, 3 Auto Service” garages and more than
114 Requal garages in 2019. Our distribution network in Benelux makes up to two deliveries per day, with
delivery times under three hours. In the 2011 to 2019 period, the Doyen Auto Group’s revenue in Benelux grew
organically at a CAGR of 4.6%. Revenue organic growth in the Netherlands is currently 7.1% per annum.

In 2016, we acquired the Doyen Auto Group, giving us access to the Belgian and Dutch markets through
Doyen Auto’s network of affiliated distributors (API) and two networks of branded garages (1,2,3 AutoService
and Requal). The acquisition of the Doyen Auto Group also gave us exposure to the web dealer channel in
Benelux and strengthened our position with web dealers in France and also expanded our market share in France
through Doyen Auto Group’s light vehicle spare parts distribution operations in France. Doyen Auto’s activities
are managed on an international level from Belgium. Since the acquisition of Doyen Auto, we have exported the

130


-----

Autodistribution concept, network and platforms to these new markets, while developing a complementary offer
that targets differentiated customers (such as smaller distributors).

In 2018, we acquired Geevers, an independent retailer of light vehicle spare parts in Benelux, which stocks
over 100,000 spare body parts and offers approximately four million products, and Verviers Freins, a Belgian
multi-brand distributor of mechanical parts, bodywork, paint, tools and garage equipment in the Liège region.

The map below shows our network in Benelux as of December 31, 2019.

Our customers in Benelux are API distributors (wholesalers with an API distribution contract), web players,
repairer groups (such as Auto 5, First Stop and Midas) and wholesalers (independent auto parts distributors).

_Italy_

As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately 36,000 square meters of storage capacity in Italy that
stocks approximately 200,000 SKUs representing more than 150 brands. Our network in Italy includes 2,200
distributors.

In 2017, we acquired three Italian players, OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car, making us the number two player
in Italy. OVAM operates in five distribution locations (operating in the Padua and Treviso area under the “Sarco”
brand and in the Florence area under the “Sarpi” brand) which serve a network of 900 installers/repairers and
offers approximately 100,000 SKUs. Ricauto and Top Car operate in two distribution locations (mainly in the
Padua area) and offer approximately 65,000 SKUs. In March 2018, we expanded further into Italy with the
acquisitions of Sarco and FGL. In 2017, Sarco and FGL operated one distribution site each, stocking 40,000
SKUs and 35,000 SKUs, respectively. In June 2018, we acquired G-Group which operates in southern Italy and
serves a network of 1,000 installers or repairers with approximately 140,000 active SKUs.

The map below shows our presence in Italy as of December 31, 2019.

We are working on capturing synergies in Italy through a local CPU which is modeled on our CPU in
France, and by replicating our negotiating strategy with suppliers in France.

_Spain_

In 2019, we acquired a 75.1% stake in AD Bosch, a distributor offering a variety of products and specialized
services in the automotive industry. Its activities are mainly focused on the distribution of spare parts, the sale of
lubricants and other chemicals, the sale of machinery for repair and washing stations, after-sales support services,
industrial supplies and a range of services such as training and technical assistance. AD Bosch is the leading
distributor in Catalonia and has a network of 27 stores, primarily in the Barcelona and Girona area.
AD Bosch is one of the largest members of AD Parts, a leading independent auto parts network of
purchasing, distribution, manufacturing and services in Iberia that regroups approximately 27 independent
affiliated distributors. AD Parts comprises approximately 490 distribution centers in Spain and Portugal and has
historically demonstrated a strong growth track record, gaining market share from its competitors.

Since the acquisition of AD Bosch in August 2019, we have approximately 51,700 square meters of storage
capacity in Spain that stocks approximately 106,000 SKUs representing more than 416 brands. Our network in
Spain includes five distributors.

The map below shows our presence in Spain as of December 31, 2019.

**_Trucks_**

Our Trucks segment addresses two market levels: distribution and repair and maintenance. At the
distribution level, we distribute products to garages and integrated workshops and we are able to make deliveries
in under four hours around France. At the repair and maintenance level, we offer our services through a whollyowned network of garages. In 2019, our Trucks segment generated revenue, including all network sales, of
€165.4 million.

We benefit from a scale effect, holding 18% market share in the truck IAM in France in 2019 and managing
a large network of approximately 228 locations (of which approximately 125 are service and distribution
locations and approximately 103 are AD Poids Lourds-branded garages).

133


-----

The map below shows our truck spare parts distribution and repair network in France as of December 31,
2019.

In recent years, our Trucks segment has experienced challenges due to difficult market conditions as well as
a lack of truck spare parts specialization embedded in the light vehicle business, a lack of central focus and
performance monitoring and underperforming locations.

Over the 2015 to 2019 period, our Trucks segment revenue increased by 3.4%, from €160.0 million to
€165.4 million. Our Trucks segment’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to
€2.8 million and 1.8%, respectively, in 2015 and increased to €5.6 million and 3.4%, respectively, in 2019.

Our value-added services approach for our Trucks segment is based on and adapted from the same approach
we use in our light vehicle segments and includes:

   - _Best-in-class delivery times: We have approximately 10,000 square meters of dedicated logistics_
platform space for our Trucks segment and stores approximately 25,000 SKUs.

   - _Commercial support: We employ locally-based sales teams, comprising 121 professionals in 2019, of_
which 67 were commercial managers, 9 were sales managers, 7 were key accounts managers and 38
were call center managers or salespersons.

   - _Training and technical support: We run a training center, “Institut AD” and a technical support_
platform dedicated to our Trucks segment through a partnership with IMA Technologies.

   - _Strong commercial concept and integrated branding: As in our light vehicle segments, we employ an_
integrated, single brand approach in our Trucks segment, leading to strong lock-up of affiliates (both
distributors and garages). AD Poids Lourds is a unique brand with the highest brand recognition (64%
unprompted awareness) among independent players in France in 2019, with more than two times
higher awareness than the number two player. Demonstrating the power of this brand awareness, we
are a partner of choice for truck fleet operators and garages and there are early signs of success as
measured by improved monthly revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2019.

134


-----

   - _Business focus on key accounts: In 2019, 20% of our revenue in our Trucks segment was generated_
from national key accounts (such as Veolia and Geodis), with 60% of revenue in our Trucks segment
generated from national and regional key accounts collectively.

   - _Online tools: We offer a dedicated online portal, Truckissimo, for our Trucks segment, which includes_
continuously updated technical databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use tool outlining
repair methods and connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price comparison
tools by brand and inventory access. We also offer our customers digital support through AD Connect.

We also seek to capture upside from our partnership with Alltrucks, a joint venture created by OESs to
establish a network of affiliated workshops. Founded in 2013 and present in ten countries as of 2018, Alltrucks
offers our affiliated workshops exclusive multi-brand diagnostics and trainings, technical assistance and access to
a pan-European workshop network. We benefit from our membership in Alltrucks, and our Level 2 accreditation
with three OESs grants us an improved access to parts and gaining access to foreign truck operations that are
active in France.

Our Trucks segment is supported by one specialized, partially automated logistics platform, Bremstar.
Bremstar was established in 1995 and was acquired by us in 2008. Bremstar operates from our hub in SaintFargeau-Ponthierry, France. It has approximately 10,000 square meters of storage space and stores approximately
25,000 SKUs. Deliveries of regular orders are made within one business day.

**_Digital B2C_**

In July 2018, we acquired a 4.95% ownership stake in Oscaro for consideration of €10 million. On
November 13, 2018, we increased our total ownership stake in Oscaro to 82.49% for incremental consideration
of €81.3 million, which included a capital investment of €55 million in Oscaro. Indenoï, the holding company of
Oscaro’s founder Pierre-Noël Luiggi, retains a share of up to approximately 17.5% in Oscaro. Mr. Luiggi does
not hold any operational role in the company.

Oscaro is an independent online distributor of light vehicle spare parts and was established in 2001. It is the
leader in online sales of light vehicle spare parts in France, which is the fastest growing independent aftermarket
distribution channel, and has an online market share of approximately 50% in France based on online sales.
Oscaro’s e-commerce platform allows car owners to buy automotive parts online from a range of manufacturers,
without going through automotive dealers. Oscaro’s product offering includes new spare parts from
manufacturers and wholesalers which include Bosch, Continental, Contiteck, Luk, SKF, TRW Automotive and
Valeo, and we have been one of the key spare parts suppliers of Oscaro. Oscaro generates revenue primarily from
its B2C (DIY) segment and operates mainly in France and, to a lesser extent, in other markets such as Spain. In
2019, we served approximately 2.5 million customers in France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, received
approximately 12,000 orders a day and offered a portfolio of approximately 1 million SKUs through Oscaro.
Oscaro has a strong leadership in the growing French online light vehicle spare parts aftermarket with an
approximate market share of over 47% in 2019, mainly due to its high brand awareness and customer loyalty.

Since the completion of the acquisition, we implemented various initiatives following the acquisition of
Oscaro to bring Oscaro back to profitability. These initiatives were successful, with Oscaro returning to
profitability in third quarter of the year 2019 and reaching positive EBITDA for the full year 2019. As of
December 31, 2019, Oscaro had more than 7.2 million customers and benefits from a high brand awareness in the
French market (approximately 62%), more than three times as much as its closest pure online competitor
(approximately 17%).

**Sales and marketing**

Our success is largely attributable to the loyalty of our customers and we commit substantial time and
resources to understanding, communicating and meeting the needs of our customers.

Our sales department is responsible for managing relationships with existing customers and establishing
relationships with new customers, setting sales targets and implementing sales policies, which includes customer
payment terms in cooperation with the finance and control department and managing payment collection in
cooperation with the administration department.

Our marketing department is located at our headquarters in Arcueil, France, and is focused on improving
awareness and perception of our brands. We market our distribution services to both affiliated independent
distributors and garages, and engages in joint marketing campaigns with our suppliers that target customers. This
integrated branding approach increases our visibility and helps us recruit new branded garages.

135


-----

We continuously invest in our marketing efforts in order to sustain sales and upgrade our existing offerings.
Our websites are one of our main marketing tools. Our websites (excluding Oscaro.com) received an average of
820,000 individual visitors per month in 2019. We also regularly organize promotional campaigns for certain of
the spare parts that we distribute.

**Customer service**

We provide support to our customers through call centers, mobile technology, training programs and
customer outreach. We have structured our customer service around the principle of bringing business to our
customers, leveraging the various value-added services it offers customers to help them grow their own sales and
services offerings.

**Information technology**

Our business depends on having advanced, secure information systems and capacity to store, retrieve,
process and manage large quantities of information. Our IT teams play an important role in our distribution
process and operations by providing support for sales, inventory and supply chain logistics, accounting and
internal controls.

Our IT strategy is currently structured around local IT teams that are adapted to our business needs in
specific locations, while taking a unified approach for our financial reporting systems. This has enabled us to
leverage our acquisition target’s IT systems that are in place at the time of an acquisition. Additionally, following
our recent international expansion, we plan to implement a transformation of our global IT strategy, which is
focused on leveraging best practices and coherence and consistency among our IT systems.

Our IT systems are supervised by our information officer and are managed in-house by teams of IT
professionals who are supported by third parties. In addition, our online activities are overseen by managers with
e-commerce experience.

Two data centers support the continuity and connectivity of our IT systems and our data is backed up daily.
Various business continuity plans have been created to respond to possible future incidents. These plans are
regularly reviewed, tested and updated.

Our IT systems provide a full range of business process support and information to our management,
logistics platforms and customers. We utilize a combination of customized and industry standard software
systems to provide various functions related to:

   - inventory management;

   - e-commerce fulfillment;

   - quality control;

   - front office and back office applications; and

   - contact with our suppliers.

Our IT teams, in coordination with the sales department, have developed software, including customized
licensed software, such as Autossimo and Truckissimo to integrate our logistics platforms with an electronic
interface that allows customers to place orders online and obtain information regarding product availability, sales
terms, conditions and shipping times. In 2012, our IT teams also developed a tablet-based “e-book” program that
allows our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and make suggestions for purchases based on
customer profile.

Our IT teams collaborate with the logistics department, primarily to update the software and algorithms used
to determine adequate inventory levels at our warehouses, product flows and optimal shelf positioning for
products. We have recently upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT management system of our
light vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage inventory more efficiently. Our IT system also
enables it to determine product availability in real time and update the inventories in our warehouses accordingly.

**_Intellectual property_**

Our intellectual property comprises a combination of complementary rights, including the following:

   - _Copyrights. We maintain a policy of filing preliminary copyright applications (enveloppes Soleau) with_
the French Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle for our product designs. We submit our
drawings and designs to a bailiff (huissier), which identifies us as the inventor and is intended to
prevent competitors from copying our designs.

136


-----

   - _Trademarks. We own the right to the “Autodis Group” and “Autodistribution” names, our most_
important trademarks, which we have registered with the European Community Trademark and
International Trademark Registration. Autodistribution also owns the right to certain other names that
we use in ordinary course of business, including Garage Expert AD, Auto Primo, Autossimo, AD PL,
the “AD” logo and ISOTECH, which we have registered with the European Community Trademark
and International Trademark Registration.

   - _Database rights. We own certain rights with respect to our customer database, in compliance with_
European and French regulations, in particular with the regulations promulgated by the French
National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des
_libertes) relating to notification of the use of “cookies.”_

   - _Domain names. We own a portfolio of domain names and have registered them with the relevant_
authorities.

Some of our products integrate third-party technologies. In order to obtain the rights to use these third-party
technologies, we have entered into license agreements in connection with certain software that it uses for our
back-office, finance, human resources and store management systems.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2019, we employed a total of 7,347 people. The following table sets forth the number
of employees as of December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.

**Year ended December 31,**

**2017** **2018** **2019**

In the last three years, we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as a result of strikes,
work stoppages or other labor disputes that were specific to us. We believe that our relations with our employees
are good.

We attach great importance to providing high-quality and expert service to our customers. Maintaining and
repairing complex light vehicles and trucks requires well-trained and skillful employees. Selling light vehicle and
truck spare parts and equipment and tools also requires expertise regarding the products and their use. We
therefore provide our employees with a broad range of training.

**Property, plant and equipment**

The majority of our sites are leased. As of December 31, 2019, we leased and owned the following property,
plant and equipment:

**Environment and sustainable development**

**_Environmental regulations_**

In connection with our operations, we are generally subject to environmental laws and regulations in each of
the countries where it operates and distributes our products. Although we do not manufacture the products we
distribute, the storage of spare parts subjects our facilities and operations to environmental and occupational
health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. These laws govern, among
other things, discharges of pollutants, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and the
clean-up of contaminated properties.

Environmental authorizations or permits required for some of our operations may be reviewed, modified or
revoked by the issuing authorities. We believe that we are in material compliance with the environmental laws
applicable to our business. Our environmental and occupational health and safety costs have not significantly
affected our results of operations or financial position during the previous twelve months.

**_Environmental and sustainable development policy_**

We pay close attention to the environmental impact of our business in the management of our sites and we
are committed to corporate social and environmental responsibility.

For example, we carried out an audit of the energy performance of each of our subsidiaries in 2016. In
addition, as part of our acquisition process, we carry out systematic environmental due diligence for all
acquisition targets. If phase I of the environmental due diligence reveals environmental matters needing
resolution, a phase II audit is carried out and we do not enter into any transaction before the resolution of the
matters that were identified in phase I of the due diligence. Regarding pollution risks, our insurance broker
carries out preventative site inspections and, when pollution cases are reported to us, a remediation plan is
deployed.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary operation of our business, including
property and casualty insurance policies that are typical for the industry in which we operate, at levels that we
believe are appropriate when taking into account our size and the risks incurred.

Our global insurance programs are negotiated and coordinated by our headquarters, which is responsible for
identifying our insurable risks, quantifying their potential consequences for us, and designing or structuring
adequate insurance programs with the support of leading insurance brokers with international networks. We aim
to ensure that they maintain sufficient coverage for all our activities and locations worldwide. We have
established internal claims procedures for each of our insurance policies in the event we experience a loss. We
also periodically review our insurance coverage in light of innovative and new risk transfer solutions offered by
the insurance markets in order to ensure that the terms and conditions of our coverage are adequate, to verify that
our deductibles and premiums are at reasonable levels and to reflect changes in our risk profile that arise as a
result of events such as mergers and acquisitions, new fields of activity and the development of new
technologies.

Our global insurance programs generally take the form of master policies, which apply to our operations
worldwide. We enter into local insurance policies generated from these master programs to comply with local
insurance-related regulatory obligations, as applicable in certain countries. We do not operate, rent or own any
captive insurance vehicles.

Our main insurance policies, entered into with reputable insurance companies, cover lines of exposures
including the following:

   - general liability insurance, which covers general corporate liability;

138


-----

   - IT insurance, which covers technology based services;

   - workers’ compensation insurance;

   - property damage and business interruption insurance;

   - environmental liability insurance;

   - transit freight insurance;

   - director and officer liability insurance; and

   - fleet insurance.

Our insurance policies contain exclusions, caps and deductibles that could expose us to unfavorable
consequences in case of a significant event or legal action against us. Moreover, we may be required to
indemnify third parties for certain damages that are not covered by our insurance policies or to incur significant
expenses that may not be covered, or may be insufficiently covered, under our insurance policies.

**Legal proceedings**

We become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our
business, such as employee claims, disputes with our suppliers, disputes with our lessors at the renewal of our
commercial leases and intellectual property disputes. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings
which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be difficult to
predict and we offer no assurance in this regard.

**REGULATION**

_We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. Some of the most pertinent to the business sector_
_in which we operate are laws and regulations that pertain to the light vehicle and truck wholesale sector and_
_light vehicle inspections. The paragraphs below briefly describe some of those laws and regulations (focusing on_
_French and EU laws and regulations). This section does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the_
_laws and regulations to which we are subject and that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes._

**European Union**

The sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts wholesale, and repair and maintenance, services are
currently regulated in the European Union by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”), which replaced
Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) in 2010. Unlike BER 2002, the New BER does not apply to
the purchase, sale or resale of new motor vehicles, which are covered by Regulation 330/2010/EC. Accordingly,
the material scope of the New BER is now limited to the distribution of spare parts and the provision of repair
and maintenance services for motor vehicles.

The New BER also applies to (i) the general EU competition law and (ii) the General Vertical Block
Exemption Regulation (Commission Regulation (EU) n°330/2010 of April 20, 2010 on the Application of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices
(the “General BER”)) and the corresponding EU Guidelines on Vertical Restraints.

These provisions aim to ensure fair competition in these markets in order to safeguard that original and
equivalent spare parts manufacturers competing with those branded by the light vehicle (referred to as “passenger
cars” under the New BER) and truck (referred to as “commercial vehicles” under the New BER) manufacturers
have full access to the market.

Pursuant to these rules, agreements relating to the sale or distribution of light vehicle and truck spare parts
and repair and maintenance services are exempted from the application of Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”), which prohibits anticompetitive agreements and concerted
practices, if they comply with the provisions of both:

   - the General BER, which only applies if:

(a) both parties have less than 30% of the market share in their respective markets; and

(b) the agreement does not contain any of the hardcore restrictions provided in the General BER; and

   - the New BER, which implies that:

(a) no restriction may be imposed on the business of independent garages by way of a selective
distribution system under which a member of the network is prohibited from selling goods or
services to independent garages;

(b) no limitations may be imposed on any supplier of spare parts, repair tools, diagnostic or other
equipment to freely sell such goods to independent or authorized distributors, garages or end-users; and

(c) no restrictions may be imposed on suppliers of components for the initial assembly of motor
vehicles limiting their ability to place their own trademark or logo effectively and easily on the
components supplied or on spare parts.

Furthermore, the European Commission may declare that both the General BER and the New BER are not
applicable where parallel networks with similar competition restraints cover more than 50% of a relevant market.

The agreements relating to the sale and distribution of spare parts that do not fulfill the conditions of the
General BER and/or of the New BER (which, according to the European Commission, is likely to be the case for
most agreements) may nonetheless benefit from an individual exemption if they fulfill the conditions provided in
Article 101(3) of the TFEU.

In this regard, however, notice no. 2010/C 138/05 (European Commission’s Supplementary Guidelines on
Vertical Restraints in Agreements for the Sale and Repair of Vehicles and for the Distribution of Replacement Parts
for Vehicles) (“notice 2010/C 138/05”), which provides some guidelines on the application and interpretation of the
New BER, further specifies that it is very doubtful that selective distribution agreements that would contain any of
the two following restrictions could benefit from an exemption under Article 101(3) of the TFEU:

   - failure for the motor vehicle manufacturer to provide independent operators (including independent
repairers, spare parts manufacturers and distributors, manufacturers of repair equipment or tools,

140


-----

publishers of technical information, automobile clubs, roadside assistance operators, operators offering
inspection and testing services, and operators offering training for repairers) with appropriate access to
the brand-specific technical information required to perform repair and maintenance work on branded
motor vehicles in fair competition with authorized garages and distributors; and

   - explicit or implicit reservation of repair services by the supplier to the members of its authorized
network only. As Recital 69 of notice no. 2010/C 138/05 clarifies, the legal or extended warranty may
not, for example, be conditioned either (i) on the obligation for the end-user to have the repair and
maintenance services not covered by the warranty exclusively performed by a member of the network
or (ii) on the obligation for the end- user to use spare parts branded by the manufacturer in respect of
replacements not covered by the warranty.

The foregoing provisions aim essentially to foster access to the repair and maintenance services marketed by
independent garages and facilitate the identification of compatible spare parts of alternative suppliers, thereby
fostering competition between such articles (known as “equivalent” parts) and those bearing the manufacturer’s
trademark.

As further specified by the European Commission in notice no. 2010/C 138/05, the New BER also aims to
protect access by spare parts suppliers to the motor vehicle aftermarkets, thereby ensuring that competing brands
of spare parts continue to be available to both independent and authorized repairers, as well as to parts
wholesalers. The European Commission emphasizes that the availability of such spare parts entails significant
advantages for consumers especially since there are often large differences in price between parts sold by the
manufacturer and alternative parts. In particular, the following may be employed as substitutes for spare parts
bearing the manufacturer’s trademark: (i) original parts manufactured and distributed by original equipment
suppliers; and (ii) replacement parts of “equivalent quality” to the original components. In the same notice, the
European Commission specifies that in order to be considered of “equivalent quality,” spare parts must be “of a
sufficiently high quality that their use does not endanger the reputation of the authorized network” that employs
them. The European Commission places the burden of proving that a part does not satisfy the requirements for
being considered of “equivalent quality” on the vehicle manufacturer.

In France, the New BER, as well as the General BER, are binding and directly applicable. Accordingly, the
French courts and the French Competition Authority assess vertical agreements entered into in the sectors of light
vehicle and truck spare parts wholesale and repair and maintenance services in light of these regulations and of
the corresponding guidelines.

**Inspection**

European light vehicle inspections are currently regulated by the Directive of the European Parliament and
the Council of Europe dated as of April 3, 2014 (“Directive 2014/45/EU”), as amended, providing for periodic
technical inspections of each vehicle matriculated in a Member State.

With regard to light vehicles with fewer than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat) and trucks permitted to
operate up to 3.5 tons, Directive 2014/45/EU requires inspections to be made (i) four years after the first
utilization and (ii) every two years thereafter. With regard to light vehicles with more than eight seats (excluding
the driver’s seat), trucks authorized to carry more than 3.5 tons, taxis and ambulances, such controls must be
performed within one year from the first utilization and every year thereafter.

In France, the requirements set forth in Directive 2014/45/EU have been provided for in the French
Highway Code since 2004. If vehicles are not inspected when due, pecuniary penalties can be imposed and may
be increased for repeated violation or for vehicles on the road that were suspended as a result of the inspection
and may also entail the impoundment of the vehicle or the confiscation of the vehicle registration certificate
(Articles R.323-1 et seq. of the French Highway Code).

**Protection of design and models for “visible” parts**

In the absence of EU harmonization, each Member State remains free to govern the legal protection of designs
and models for “visible” parts. In France, according to the French Intellectual Property Code, the distribution of
“visible” parts (such as wings, bumpers and windscreens) is protected by industrial design rights (Articles L-511-1
and seq. of the French Intellectual Property Code). Consequently, only the manufacturer has the right to distribute
these parts to various repairers. However, it must be noted that the French Competition Authority has recently
recommended the gradual removal of the restriction on the distribution of “visible” spare parts destined for repairs.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and structure_**

On November 12, 2015, Dakar (BC) Luxco S.à r.l. and Dakar Acquisition S.A. entered into a Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement among, inter alios, the Issuer (upon its accession on December 8, 2015), J.P. Morgan
Limited, Credit Suisse International and BNP Paribas S.A. as arrangers, the financial institutions named therein
as original lenders, the institution named therein as Agent and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as Security Agent
(each as defined therein), which was amended on October 3, 2016, October 26, 2016, November 3, 2016, and
March 18, 2020 (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”). Borrowings available under our Revolving Credit
Facility were increased from €50.0 million to an aggregate principal amount of €80.0 million on a committed
basis as of June 13, 2018, and further increased to €90.0 million on a committed basis on July 13, 2018, and to
€100.0 million on a committed basis on March 18, 2020.

The committed facility made available under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Revolving
Credit Facility”) may be utilized by any current or future borrower (“Borrower”) under the Revolving Credit
Facility in euro, pounds sterling, U.S. dollars and any other currency approved by the lenders by the drawing of
cash advances, the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit and by way of ancillary facilities. Subject to
certain exceptions, amounts may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed at any time. Borrowings will be available
for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, for capital
expenditure, acquisitions and investments not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

In addition, subject to certain conditions, the Total Commitments under and as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement may be increased at any time up to an amount which, together with any other credit
facilities or debt securities ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility in right of payment and right to
receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral, would not exceed the basket for such permitted credit
facilities or debt securities under the Indenture, including by way of (i) an increase in the Total Commitments in
respect of the Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) the inclusion and making available of commitments in respect of
one or more additional facilities.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized
until the date falling one month prior to the Termination Date (as defined below) of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantor are each a Borrower and Guarantor under and as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Issuer and, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles (as defined therein), the Guarantors. A mechanism is included in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement to enable any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries in France, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg and any other agreed jurisdiction to accede as an Additional Borrower under the Revolving Credit
Facility subject to certain conditions.

**_Maturity and repayment requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the earlier of (i) September 18, 2024 and (ii) the date falling
three (3) months prior to the final scheduled maturity date of the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes and
the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, if the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes and the
Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes have not been refinanced in full on or prior to such date with
Refinancing Indebtedness (as such term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) which has a final
scheduled maturity falling not earlier than December 18, 2024 (the “Termination Date”).

Each utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating
thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under
the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility is the rate per annum equal to the
aggregate of the applicable margin and EURIBOR or LIBOR (as applicable, subject to a 0% floor). The margin

147


-----

under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be 3.50% per annum for the first twelve months of its term. From the
date falling twelve months from December 8, 2015 (the “Closing Date”), and subject to certain conditions, the
margin on utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to a ratchet as follows:


**Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio**


**Margin**

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from (and including) the Closing Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for
the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the
availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in
full or on the date on which a lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agent”) and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and fronting fees to the issuing bank under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and letter of credit fees to the Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) in an amount equal to the then applicable margin of the Revolving Credit Facility (and (if
applicable) an additional facility loan) with respect to an issuance of letters of credit (subject to certain conditions
and exclusions).

**_Guarantees_**

Each Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement has provided a senior secured guarantee of
all amounts payable to the finance parties by each other obligor (including any additional borrowers that accede
to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests”)._

**_Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the Collateral. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may
from time to time benefit from certain guarantees and security, in addition to the Collateral, which do not
guarantee or secure the Notes.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of security in respect of the
Collateral (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay
indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Notes.

**_Representations and warranties_**

**_Notes purchase condition_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides that the Issuer may prepay/redeem/repurchase/ defease/
otherwise retire for value any senior secured notes issued by the Issuer, including senior secured notes issued
under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, prior to their scheduled maturity (a “Note Purchase”)
without any obligation to make any pro rata prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility commitments where
such redemption or repurchase is (a) made: (i) following a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and as further described in “ —Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a change of
_control or a sale” below), provided that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in respect_
of a Change of Control are complied with; (ii) from the proceeds of any indebtedness that refinances any senior
secured notes, including senior secured notes issued under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, that
complies with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement; or (iii) from the proceeds of new equity
subscriptions, debt subordinated to the Revolving Credit Facility in right of payment, amounts available to be
distributed to the Parent Guarantor in accordance with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, Intercreditor
Agreement, senior secured notes issued by the Issuer, including senior secured notes issued under the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Indentures; or (b) provided no Event of Default (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) is continuing or would result from such Note Purchase, in an amount not exceeding 50% of the
aggregate amount in existence and uncancelled on the Closing Date of: the aggregate face value of the senior
secured notes issued by the Issuer, including senior secured notes issued under the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures; over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding for these purposes (i) any fees, make-whole
payments, call premiums and other amounts not constituting principal with respect to such Note Purchase and
(ii) proceeds of any indebtedness that refinances any senior secured notes issued by the Issuer, including senior
secured notes issued under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures (the “Note Purchase Basket”).

Where the Issuer makes Note Purchases in excess of the Note Purchase Basket and which are not otherwise
made in accordance with paragraph (a) above, the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments shall be
cancelled, and if applicable, prepaid in the same proportion until the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments
have been reduced to not more than €20,000,000.

**_Additional covenants_**

The additional covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information, including

**_Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a change of control or a sale_**

Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which includes the sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries and, subject to certain
conditions, an Adverse Corporate Decision (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)) the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility Lenders”) shall not be obligated
to fund utilizations (other than rollover utilizations), and if a Revolving Credit Facility Lender requests and gives
notice to the Revolving Credit Facility Agent, within 30 days of receiving notice of such Change of Control, that
its commitments shall be cancelled and that it requires payment of all of its share of the outstanding utilizations
and all other amounts owing to it, the Revolving Credit Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Issuer that such
Revolving Credit Facility Lender shall be required to be prepaid or replaced and its commitments cancelled in
full on the date falling 30 days after such Revolving Credit Facility Lender has given notice to the Revolving
Credit Facility Agent.

149


-----

**_Financial covenant_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we are required to test the drawn super senior leverage
covenant, being the ratio of drawn super senior net debt under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA, of 0.7:1 (the “Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant”) if, on any Test Date
(commencing on the first Test Date to occur after two full Test Periods have elapsed after the Closing Date), the
Test Condition has been met. The financial covenant is calculated and tested quarterly, provided that exceeding
the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant on any Test Date should only result in a drawstop under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and shall not constitute or result in a default or an event of default and shall
not operate as a drawstop in respect of any rollover loans or other rollover utilizations.

To the extent that the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant has been exceeded on a Test Date, subject to
certain limitations as more fully detailed in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer may cure that
covenant (i) automatically where the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant is not exceeded on the following
Test Date or the Test Condition is not met on the following Test Date or (ii) through the receipt of new
shareholder injections and/or subordinated shareholders loans by the date falling no later than 20 business days
after the date that the quarterly financial statements for that relevant period were due to be delivered, in an
amount sufficient to, subject to certain limitations and at the election of the Issuer ensure such Drawn Super
Senior Leverage Covenant would have been met had the proceeds from such new shareholder injection or
subordinated shareholder loan been applied (A) towards consolidated pro forma EBITDA or (B) in reduction of
drawn super senior net debt immediately prior to the end of the relevant period.

“Relevant Period” means each period of twelve months ending on or about the last day of each Test Date.

“Test Condition” means, on any Test Date, the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans under the
Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility by way of letters of credit
(or bank guarantees) or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any OID) on the last day of the
Relevant Period exceeds 35% of the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments as of such date or if higher, the
total Revolving Credit Facility commitments as at the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

“Test Date” means each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31.

“Test Period” means the period commencing on the day immediately following a Test Date and ending on
the next occurring Test Date.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for the same events of default (with certain adjustments
as necessary) as will be provided for under the Indenture.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for customary events of default, all of which are subject
to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as
appropriate, including: (i) misrepresentation; (ii) unlawfulness and invalidity; (iii) breach of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (iv) the repudiation and rescission of finance documents.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection
with it are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law although the restrictive
covenants certain information undertakings and certain events of default, which are included in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, are interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by, and shall be governed by, English law).

**PGE Loan**

On July 1, 2020, we entered into a super senior liquidity facility agreement among, inter alios, the Issuer, as
company, BNP Paribas S.A. and Société Générale, as Original Lenders, U.S. Bank Global Corporate Trust
Limited, as Agent, and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as Security Agent (the “PGE Loan”). The PGE Loan
provides for a term loan facility in principal amount of €25.0 million to finance (i) general corporate needs of the
Group triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak and required to maintain the Group’s business activity and
employees in France, including the Group’s liquidity and working capital needs and (ii) fees, costs and expenses
arising in connection with the PGE Loan. Drawing under the PGE Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the publication of a decision (arreˆte´ ministe´riel) by the French government to confirm the
guarantee of the loan by the French State. We cannot guarantee that the French government will issue this arreˆte´
_ministe´riel and that we will be able to draw on the PGE Loan. The PGE Loan will remain outstanding following_
the completion of the Refinancing.

150


-----

The obligations under the PGE Loan are guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by the Collateral. In
addition, the French State guarantees up to 80% of the principal, interest, penalties and otherwise (capital,
_intérêts et accessoires) with respect to the PGE Loan. The PGE Loan also benefits from certain guarantees and_
security, in addition to the Guarantors and the Collateral, which guarantee and secured the Revolving Credit
Facility but do not guarantee or secure the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from
the enforcement of security in respect the Collateral (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be
required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan
in priority to the Notes.

The PGE Loan will mature on the date falling twelve months after the date of funding, which we expect to
occur in the first half of July 2020. The Issuer has the option to extend the maturity date by one, two, three, four
or five years at its sole discretion. The Issuer is subject to certain mandatory prepayments under the PGE Loan
prior to its maturity date upon the occurrence of certain events, including (i) a change of control, (ii) an initial
public offering, (iii) certain issuances of debt securities or refinancing, and (iv) a loss of the guarantee by the
French State or non-compliance with the Undertaking (as defined below).

The interest rate on the PGE Loan is the rate per annum equal to the aggregate of the applicable margin and
EURIBOR (as applicable, subject to a 0% floor). The margin under the PGE Loan is 1.30% per annum for the
first twelve months of its term, and a margin to be agreed between the Issuer and the lenders afterward.

The PGE Loan contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and related definitions (with certain
adjustments) that will apply to the Notes. In addition, the PGE Loan contains restrictions on (i) the distribution of
dividends, as this term is understood for purposes of the Engagement de responsabilité pour les grandes
_entreprises bénéficiant de mesures de soutien en trésorerie published in May 2020 (the “Undertaking”), or any_
payment pursuant to a share buyback, except in accordance with the provisions of the Undertaking; and (ii) the
ability for the French entities of the Group to have tax headquarters or subsidiaries without economic substance
in a Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction, as these terms are understood for purposes of the Undertaking.

The PGE Loan and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with French law although the restrictive covenants certain information
undertakings and certain events of default, which are included in the PGE Loan, are interpreted in accordance
with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the PGE Loan is governed by, and shall be governed by,
French law).

Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities”), that is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit
Facility Documents, the Existing Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing
Senior Unsecured Note Document to rank equally with any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, subject
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Senior
Unsecured Notes Creditors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides for any credit facility constituting a “Credit Facility” under the
Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the Existing
Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Document
to receive priority in respect of the proceeds of the enforcement against the Collateral (each such facility being a
“Credit Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities” and each finance
document relating thereto (but excluding any Hedging Agreement), a “Credit Facility Document”). Each lender
under a Credit Facility is a “Credit Facility Lender” and excluding any Hedging Liabilities, the liabilities of the
Debtors to the Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the “Credit Facility Lender Liabilities.”

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the
terms of a Debt Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will
prevail.

By purchasing a Note, holders of the Notes shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Trustee to accede into the Intercreditor
Agreement on their behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not
restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety.

-----

**_Ranking and priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted payments described
below, that (i) the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities; (ii) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Hedging
Agreements entered into in relation to interest rate hedging in respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Notes or any
Senior Unsecured Notes or (2) in respect of Pari Passu Debt (the “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities” and,
together with the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities and the Creditor Representative Liabilities owed to the Credit
Facility Agent, the “Super Senior Liabilities” and the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities, the “Super Senior
Creditors”); (iii) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Hedging Agreements entered into in relation to
foreign currency hedging in respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Notes or the Senior Unsecured Notes or (2) in
respect of Pari Passu Debt (the “Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities” and the creditors of the Non-Super
Senior Hedging Liabilities, the “Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties”); (iv) the Notes Liabilities; (v) the
Existing Notes Liabilities; (vi) the Pari Passu Liabilities (together with the Notes Liabilities and the Non-Super
Senior Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Liabilities,” and the creditors of the Senior Secured Liabilities,
the “Senior Secured Creditors”); (vii) the liabilities of the Issuer and the Debtors in respect of the Senior
Unsecured Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities”) and (viii) certain other unsecured liabilities, will
rank in right and priority of payment in the following order:

   - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the liabilities of any Debtor to an arranger under the Revolving
Credit Facility (the “Arranger Liabilities”), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the liabilities owed to the
Security Agent will rank pari passu and without any preference between them; and

   - second, the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities will rank pari passu and without any
preference between them.

The intercompany obligations (the “Intra Group Liabilities” and the documents creating or evidencing such
Intra Group Liabilities being “Intra Group Debt Documents”) of any member of the Group that is party to the
Intercreditor Agreement in such capacity to any other member of the Group (each an “Intra Group Lender” and
collectively the “Intra Group Lenders”) which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement in such capacity are
postponed and subordinated to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors (as defined herein).
The liabilities owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Issuer (or any holding company
or subsidiary of the Issuer or any other subsidiary of any such holding company that is not a member of the
Group) and any of their respective transferees or successors (the “Shareholder Liabilities” and the documents
creating or evidencing such Shareholder Liabilities being “Shareholder Debt Documents”) are postponed and
subordinated to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors.

In this section the Shareholder Liabilities and the Intra Group Liabilities are together referred to as the
“Subordinated Liabilities.”

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement have agreed or will agree, as applicable, in the Intercreditor
Agreement that the Transaction Security ranks and secures the following liabilities (but only to the extent that
such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

   - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Arranger Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities will rank
and secure such liabilities first, pari passu and without any preference between them; and

   - second (to the extent only of any security granted in favor of the Security Agent over the shares, loans,
bonds or other equity or debt instruments issued by the Issuer to the Parent Guarantor or by any
holding company of the Parent Guarantor to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer (the “SUN Shared
Security”)), the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities.

The Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities and the Subordinated Liabilities will not be secured by any of the
Transaction Security unless permitted by the Credit Facility Documents, the Existing Notes Documents and any
Pari Passu Debt Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities shall be
secured by the SUN Shared Security, if any. The Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities are senior obligations of the
Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer. Until the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes
Creditors may not take any steps to appropriate the assets of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer in connection
with any enforcement action other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all Proceeds from Enforcement of the Collateral and certain other
recoveries will be applied as provided under “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction
_Security.”_

153


-----

**_Further security and incremental borrowings_**

The creditors in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities (the Super Senior
Liabilities, the liabilities owed to Creditor Representatives (as defined herein, other than in paragraph (f) of that
definition), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Arranger Liabilities, together, the “Secured Liabilities,” and the
creditors thereof, the “Secured Parties” and the documents evidencing the Secured Liabilities, the “Secured Debt
Documents”) may take, accept or receive the benefit of additional security and additional guarantees, indemnities
or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Secured Liabilities, provided that,
if and to the extent legally possible, such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is also
granted to the Security Agent as agent and trustee of the other Secured Parties. Any such additional security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss will rank in the same order of priority as referred to above
and the proceeds of the enforcement of any such security will be applied as provided under “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security.”_

The Intercreditor Agreement contemplates the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring incremental borrowing
liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities under; or (ii) refinancing the borrowing liabilities incurred under the
documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or in respect of any Credit Facility, the Existing Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes, the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt or the
Subordinated Liabilities (such documents or instruments together with Transaction Security Documents, the
Shareholder Debt Documents and the Intra Group Debt Documents being referred to collectively as the “Debt
Documents”) and/or incurring guarantee liabilities in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with any
such refinancing (such incremental borrowing liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being
referred to as “Additional Indebtedness”) which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with and/or
share pari passu in any Transaction Security with any existing liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing
liabilities and/or to share in the Transaction Security behind such existing liabilities. The Secured Parties and the
creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities (the “Subordinated Creditors” and, collectively with the
Secured Parties and the Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors, the “Creditors” and each a “Creditor”) confirm in the
Intercreditor Agreement that, provided such financing or refinancing and such ranking and such security is
permitted or not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, they will (at the Debtors’ cost) enter into
such documentation as may be necessary (including entering into a new intercreditor agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement) to ensure that the Additional Indebtedness (and the liabilities and
obligations of the Debtors in respect of such Additional Indebtedness) will have the ranking permitted to be
conferred upon it in accordance with the terms of the Debt Documents, provided that such documentation does
not in any significant respect have a material adverse effect on the interests of any of the Secured Parties.

**_Security: Pari Passu Creditors and Notes Creditors_**

The Pari Passu Creditors and Notes Creditors may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

(a) security in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities and Existing Notes Liabilities in addition to the
Transaction Security if, at the same time, it is also granted either:

(i) to the Security Agent as trustee for the other Secured Parties in respect of their secured obligations;

(ii) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be granted in favor of the
Security Agent as trustee for the Secured Parties:

A. to the other Secured Parties in respect of their secured obligations; or

B. to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure for the benefit of the other Secured
Parties; or

(iii) in the case of any security granted after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement, to some of the
Secured Parties provided that such security is incremental to the Transaction Security that has
already been granted in favor of all other Secured Parties and any proceeds derived from the
enforcement of such security will be shared with the Secured Parties in accordance with the payment
waterfalls set forth in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security.”

and ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in “—Ranking and priority”; and

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities in
addition to those in:

(i) the original form of the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the documents or instruments creating or
evidencing the Existing Notes Liabilities (the “Existing Notes Documents”);

154


-----

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given for the benefit of all the Secured
Parties in respect of their Secured Liabilities;

only if, in each case (1) the grant of such security or the giving of such guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss is permitted by the Credit Facility Documents and (2) at the same time, it is also granted to the Credit
Facility Lenders and granted to the other Secured Parties in respect of their respective Secured Liabilities and
ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in “—Ranking and priority.”

**_Permitted payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, prior to the occurrence of an acceleration event in respect of a Credit
Facility, the Pari Passu Liabilities and the Existing Notes Liabilities (a “Secured Debt Acceleration Event”),
payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes Documents and Pari
Passu Debt Documents, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Credit Facility Agreement, the
Existing Notes Documents and Pari Passu Debt Documents, but subject to, in the case of payments in respect of
the Pari Passu Liabilities and Notes Liabilities, any restrictions under the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes
Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents then outstanding. Following the occurrence of a Secured Debt
Acceleration Event, subject to certain exceptions, payments can only be made by the Debtors applying the
amounts received by the relevant Debtor under the process described under “—Application of proceeds from
_Enforcement of Transaction Security.” The restriction in the foregoing sentence shall not apply (i) where,_
provided that the Majority Super Senior Creditors constitute the Instructing Group in accordance with
“—Enforcement decision,” a payment block suspension notice has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent to
the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) to the extent that such
Secured Debt Acceleration Event has subsequently been cancelled and/or irrevocably revoked in writing by each
relevant Creditor Representative.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments in respect of Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee
Liabilities prior to the Secured Debt Discharge Date (as defined below) to be made by the Debtors under the
Senior Unsecured Notes Documents including if (a) (i) the payment is of any principal amount of the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer Liabilities which is either not prohibited from
being paid by the Credit Facility, the Existing Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Document or is paid on
or after the final maturity date of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is a
date not earlier than one year after the Termination Date at the time of issuance of such Senior Unsecured Notes)
or is a payment of any amount that is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest or a corresponding
amount under the relevant proceeds loan for the Senior Unsecured Notes (such amount including all scheduled
interest payments, including if applicable, special interest or liquidated damages) and default interest on the
Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Debt Document, additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in the relevant indenture for the
Senior Unsecured Notes and/or applicable proceeds loan, (ii) no notice of a Secured Debt Event of Default (as
defined herein) has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) (as the case may be); and (iii) no payment default under any Credit Facility, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indentures (above an agreed threshold) and the Pari Passu Debt Documents (above an agreed
threshold) has occurred and is continuing; (b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined herein) and the
Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) give prior consent to that payment being made;
(c) the payment is of amounts owing to the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee (the “Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee Amounts”); (d) the payment is of administrative and maintenance costs, fees, expenses and taxes of the
Issuer (in acting as the issuer of the Senior Unsecured Notes) including any reporting or listing requirements, as
permitted under the terms of the Credit Facilities; or (e) the payment is of costs, commissions, taxes, premiums
and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Senior Unsecured
Notes Documents in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes
Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments to be made from time to time when due to lenders owed
any Intra Group Liabilities (“Intra Group Liabilities Payments”) if at the time of payment no Secured Debt
Acceleration Event or an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities has occurred and
is continuing (an “Acceleration Event”). The Intercreditor Agreement permits Intra Group Liabilities Payments if
(i) an Acceleration Event has occurred prior to the date on which the Super Senior Liabilities are discharged in
full (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Instructing Group (as defined, and further

155


-----

described, in “—Enforcement decision”); (ii) an Acceleration Event has occurred after the Super Senior
Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Senior Secured Liabilities are discharged in full (the “Senior
Secured Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through their
Creditor Representatives); (iii) an Acceleration Event has occurred after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but
prior to the later of the date on which the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities are discharged (the “Senior
Unsecured Notes Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (as
defined herein) (acting through their Creditor Representatives); (iv) that payment is made to facilitate payment of
the Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Secured Liabilities; or (v) to the extent a Secured Debt Acceleration Event
has subsequently been cancelled and/or irrevocably revoked in writing by each relevant Creditor Representative,
the payment is made to facilitate payments of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities that are permitted to be paid
under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and, if such payment is made pursuant to Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantees, it would be permitted at such time. At any time prior to an Acceleration Event, each Debtor may
convert its Intra Group Liabilities into equity.

Payments may be made on Shareholder Liabilities from time to time when due if: (i) the payment is not
prohibited by a Credit Facility, the Existing Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the Senior
Unsecured Notes Documents; (ii) the payment is to be made to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer in respect of
any Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer Liabilities made in order to make a corresponding payment in Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities which is then due and payable by the Senior Unsecured Issuer pursuant to the Senior
Unsecured Notes Documents (or in the case of a payment in respect of scheduled interest, such payment will
become due and payable within three business days) to be made at the time such payment of Shareholder
Liabilities is made to the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer; (iii) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group (as defined below) gives written consent to such payment being made; (iv) on or after the
Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give written consent to such payment
being made; or (v) after the Secured Debt Discharge Date but prior to Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, the
Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give
written consent to such payment being made. At any time prior to an Acceleration Event, Shareholder Liabilities
may be converted into equity.

**_Creditor Representative_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties will appoint various creditor representatives. “Creditor
Representative” means:

(a) in relation to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the facility agent under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement;

(b) in relation to the Credit Facility Lenders under any other Credit Facility, the facility agent in respect of
that credit facility (an “Additional Credit Facility Agent,” and, together with the facility agent under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, a “Credit Facility Agent”);

(c) in relation to the Existing Noteholders, the Existing Notes Trustee;

(d) in relation to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders, the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(e) in relation to any Pari Passu Creditors, the creditor representative for that tranche of Pari Passu
Creditors (each a “Pari Passu Debt Representative”); and

(f) in relation to any Hedge Counterparty, such Hedge Counterparty (which shall be its own Creditor
Representative).

**_Issue of Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice_**

(a) Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date (the “Secured
Debt Discharge Date”), except with the prior consent of the Credit Facility Agent, the consent of the
Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s), and subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement which deal with the effects of an insolvency event, the Issuer shall ensure that no
member of the Group shall make, and no Senior Unsecured Noteholder may receive from any member of
the Group, any payment in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes which would otherwise be permitted as
referred to above (other than the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amount) if:

(i) a payment default under the Secured Debt Documents (a “Secured Debt Payment Default”) has
occurred and is continuing; or

156


-----

(ii) an event of default under a Credit Facility Document, the Existing Notes Documents or the Pari
Passu Debt Documents (other than a Secured Debt Payment Default) (a “Secured Debt Event of
Default”) has occurred and is continuing, from the date on which the Credit Facility Agent or the
Existing Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative (as the case may be) (the “Relevant
Representative”) delivers a notice (a “Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to that Secured Debt Event of Default to the Senior Unsecured
Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee, until the earliest of:

A. the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;

B. the date on which a Senior Unsecured Notes Default (as defined below) occurs for failure to
pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes;

C. in relation to payments of Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, if a Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of that Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Senior Unsecured Standstill Period
expires;

D. the date on which the relevant Secured Debt Event of Default is no longer continuing and, if
the relevant Secured Liabilities have been accelerated, such acceleration has been rescinded;

E. the date on which the Relevant Representative delivers a notice to the Senior Unsecured
Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee cancelling the
Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;

F. the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and

G. the date on which the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee takes any enforcement action that it is
permitted to take under the Intercreditor Agreement.

(b) Unless the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee waives this requirement:

(i) a new Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days
have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;
and

(ii) no Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Secured Debt Event
of Default more than 60 days after the date the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee or the Pari
Passu Debt Representative (as applicable) received notice of that Secured Debt Event of Default.

(c) The Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) may
serve only one Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances but this shall not, subject to paragraph (b) above, affect the right of the Credit Facility
Agent, the Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) to issue a Senior Unsecured Payment
Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

(d) The Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) may not serve a
Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to a Secured Debt Event of Default that had been
notified to each of them at the time at which an earlier Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice was
issued.

**_Cure of payment stop: Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

If at any time following the issuance of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Secured Debt Payment Default:

(a) the Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or the Secured Debt Payment
Default ceases to be continuing, as the case may be; and

(b) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents and which would have
been permitted payments but for that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or Secured Debt Payment
Default, then any Event of Default that may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments
shall be waived and any Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice (as defined below) that may have been
issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being
required on the part of the Senior Unsecured Noteholders.

157


-----

**_Restrictions on enforcement/certain challenges by Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

Until the Secured Debt Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by the Instructing
Group, no Senior Unsecured Noteholder shall take or require the taking of any enforcement action in relation to
the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities except as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (see
_“—Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement” below)._

**_Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement_**

(a) The above restrictions on enforcement will not apply if:

(i) an event of default (or event or circumstance which would, with the expiration of a grace period,
the giving of notice, the making of any determination provided for in the relevant definition of
“Event of Default” in the Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture or any combination of the foregoing,
be an event of default) under any Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture (a “Senior Unsecured Notes
Default”) (such default being a “Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default”) is continuing;

(ii) the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s)
have received a notice of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default from the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(iii) a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period.

(b) Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Unsecured Notes Default, the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee may, by notice (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Credit Facility
Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) of the existence of such
Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

**_Senior Unsecured Standstill Period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default, a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period shall mean
the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date”) the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee serves a Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice on the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee
and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) in respect of such Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default and
ending on the earliest to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period”);

(b) the date the Secured Parties take any enforcement action (excluding any action taken to preserve or
perfect any Collateral as opposed to realizing it) in relation to a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor,
provided that the Senior Unsecured Noteholders may then only take the same enforcement action in
relation to the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor as the enforcement action taken by the Secured
Parties against such Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Group;

(c) the date of an insolvency event in relation to a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor against whom
enforcement action is to be taken;

(d) the date on which a Senior Unsecured Notes Default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original
scheduled maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes; and

(e) the expiration of any other Senior Unsecured Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiration occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy).

The Senior Unsecured Noteholders may take enforcement action as described above in relation to a
Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Unsecured Standstill Period
or at any later time, a further Senior Unsecured Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Relevant
Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

158


-----

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee that it is enforcing Transaction
Security created over (directly or indirectly) shares of a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor, no Senior Unsecured
Noteholder may take any action referred to in “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement,”
against that Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor while the Security Agent is, in accordance with the instructions of
the Instructing Group, taking steps to enforce that Collateral where such action might be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Enforcement instructions_**

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or taking any other enforcement
action unless otherwise instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as further described in “—Enforcement
_decision” below)._

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms and subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent as to
the enforcement of the Transaction Security as they see fit provided that the instructions as to enforcement given
by the Instructing Group are consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (as defined herein).

**_Enforcement decision_**

If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through their
Creditor Representatives) (the “Instructing Group”) wish to instruct the Security Agent to commence
enforcement of any Transaction Security, such group of creditors must deliver a copy of the proposed
instructions as to enforcement (the “Proposed Enforcement Instructions”) to the Security Agent and the Creditor
Representative for each of the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate). The
Security Agent shall promptly notify each Creditor Representative of the Super Senior Creditors, the Existing
Notes Trustee and each of the Pari Passu Representatives upon receipt of such Proposed Enforcement
Instructions.

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received any Proposed Enforcement
Instructions, then the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security in
accordance with the instructions of the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (and the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders shall be the Instructing Group for the purpose of “—Enforcement instructions” above, in each case,
acting through their respective Creditor Representative) provided that such instructions are consistent with
certain Security Enforcement Principles (as referred to below) and failure to give instructions will be deemed to
be an instruction not to take Enforcement steps.

In the event that:

(a) from the date that is three months after the date upon which the first Proposed Enforcement
Instructions (including such instructions not to take Enforcement steps) are delivered, the Security
Agent (acting on the instructions of the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders) has not taken any
Enforcement Action of the Transaction Security; or

(b) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of the date upon
which the first such Proposed Enforcement Instructions (including any such instructions not to take
Enforcement steps) are delivered,

then (with effect from the date of the earlier to occur of such events), the Majority Super Senior Creditors shall
become the Instructing Group for the purposes of “—Enforcement instructions” above.

If at any time the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action of the Transaction
Security notwithstanding the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, a
Creditor Representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders, as the case may be, may at any time provide immediate instructions as to Enforcement to the Security
Agent. If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith
(and notify the Creditor Representatives of the other Super Senior Creditors, the Notes Creditors, the Pari Passu
Creditors and the Security Agent) the delay in taking Enforcement Action of the Transaction Security could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security,

159


-----

and the Security Agent shall act with respect to the relevant asset or Debtor that is the subject of the
determination pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, in accordance with the first such notice of determination and
instructions as to Enforcement received by the Security Agent (provided in each case that such instructions are
consistent with certain Security Enforcement Principles (referred to herein)).

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any Debtor or Security Provider (other than
an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to
the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the
instructions received from such Majority Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent
has received Proposed Enforcement Instructions from the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security
Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari
Passu Required Holders until such time as the Creditor Representative for the Majority Super Senior Creditors
issues enforcement instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such
prior instructions given by the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

Other than where the preceding two paragraphs apply, if, prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (in each case, acting reasonably)
consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a manner that is not consistent with the
Security Enforcement Principles (as referred to herein), the Creditor Representatives for the relevant Super
Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors shall give notice to the Creditor Representatives for the other Super
Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate), after which the Creditor Representatives for the
other Super Senior Creditors, the Existing Notes Trustee and each Pari Passu Debt Representative shall consult
with the Security Agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the relevant Creditor Representatives
may agree) with a view to agreeing to the manner of enforcement provided that such Creditors’ Representatives
shall not be obligated to consult in the manner referred to in this paragraph more than once in relation to each
enforcement action.

After the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions provided by the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

**_Limitation on enforcement of shareholder liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Shareholder Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement action in
respect of such liabilities prior to the last to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured
Discharge Date and the Senior Unsecured Notes Discharge Date (the “Final Discharge Date”) save that, prior to
the Final Discharge Date and after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any Debtor or member of
the Group or grantor of Transaction Security, each such Creditor may only (unless otherwise directed by the
Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf
of that Creditor in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), and shall, if so directed by the
Security Agent, exercise any right it may otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Shareholder Liabilities or declare them prematurely due
and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member
of the Group in respect of any Shareholder Liabilities;

it,

but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Limitation on enforcement of Intra Group Liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Intra Group Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement action in
respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date except that, prior to the Final Discharge Date and after
the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Group or grantor of Transaction Security,
each Intra Group Lender may only (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent

160


-----

has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Intra Group Lender in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) and shall, if so directed by the Security Agent, exercise any right it may
otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that Group member’s Intra Group Liabilities or declare them prematurely due and
payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member
of the Group in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities;

that member of the Group; or

(d) file claims, or claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the Intra Group
Liabilities owing to it, but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Security Enforcement Principles_**

A Creditor Representative may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with the following
security enforcement principles (the “Security Enforcement Principles”):

(a) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to achieve
the security enforcement objective, such objective being to maximize the recovery by the Super Senior
Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors so far as such recovery is consistent with prompt and
expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Transaction Security (the “Security
Enforcement Objective”);

(b) without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will be enforced and
other enforcement action will be taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as further described in “—Application
_of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security”); or_

(ii) in the case of enforcement by the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, sufficient proceeds from
Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are
applied in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and_
discharged in full in cash (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise); and

(c) to the extent that the Transaction Security that is the subject of the proposed enforcement action is:

(i) securing assets other than shares in a member of the Group where the aggregate book value of
such assets exceeds EUR 1 million (or its equivalent); or

(ii) over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group,

then the Security Agent shall, if requested by the Instructing Group, and at the expense of the Issuer (to the extent
that financial advisors have not adopted a general policy of not providing such opinions) appoint an
internationally recognized investment bank or accountancy firm or, if it is not practicable for the Security Agent
to appoint any such bank or firm on commercially reasonable terms (including for reasons of conflicts of interest)
as determined by the Security Agent (acting in good faith), another third-party professional firm that is regularly
engaged in providing valuations in respect of the relevant type of assets (in each case not being the firm
appointed as the relevant Debtor’s administrator or other relevant officer holder) selected by the Security Agent
(a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert that the consideration received from any disposal is fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances (a “Financial Advisor’s Opinion”);

(a) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of
a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement. Prior to making
any appointment of a Financial Advisor, the Security Agent is entitled to ensure that cost cover (at a
level it is satisfied with, acting reasonably) has been provided;

(b) the Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation
to any other enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security
Enforcement Objective has been met;

161


-----

(c) where the Instructing Group is the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor’s Opinion where sufficient Proceeds from
Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are
applied in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of proceeds
_from Enforcement of Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in_
full; and

(d) in the event that an enforcement of the Transaction Security is conducted by way of Public Auction (as
defined below), no Financial Advisor shall be required to be appointed, and no Financial Advisor’s
Opinion shall be required, in relation to such enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall be
entitled (but not obligated) to appoint a Financial Advisor to provide such advice as the Security Agent
deems appropriate in relation to such enforcement by way of Public Auction.

The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Existing Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders
of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt and the Security Agent.

“Public Auction” means an auction or other competitive sale process of assets, by or on behalf of the
Security Agent pursuant to an enforcement of Transaction Security (or by a member of the Group in
circumstances that are a Distressed Disposal (as defined herein)), the process of such sale or disposal having been
conducted as follows:

(a) prior to the sale or other disposal, the Security Agent shall, in respect of such auction or other
competitive sale process, consult with an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting
firm selected by the Security Agent (acting reasonably) with respect to the procedures which may
reasonably be expected to be used to obtain a fair market price in the then prevailing market conditions
(taking into account all relevant circumstances and in order to facilitate a prompt and expeditious sale
at a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions although there shall be no obligation to
postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price);

(b) the Security Agent shall have implemented (to the extent permitted by law) in all material respects the
procedures recommended by such bank or firm in relation to such auction or process;

(c) the Secured Parties shall have a right to participate; and

(d) HoldCo shall not have the right to participate without the consent of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (excluding the Hedge Counterparties), the Existing Notes Required Holders and the Pari
Passu Debt Required Holders of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt if such auction or competitive sale
process is in respect of SUN Shared Security or assets that were secured by such SUN Shared Security
before foreclosure thereof.

For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above:

(i) the Security Agent shall be entitled to retain any such internationally recognized investment bank
or accounting firm as its and/or any of the other Secured Parties’ financial advisor to advise and
assist in the proposed sale or disposition for such remuneration as the Security Agent in good faith
determines is appropriate for the circumstances;

(ii) except as required by applicable law, the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to any
person to engage in or to use reasonable efforts to engage in a listing of any or all of any equity
interests the subject of such auction or other competitive sale process, including, without
limitation, if recommended by such investment bank or accounting firm; and

(iii) by reason of certain prohibitions, or exemptive or safe-harbor provisions from such prohibitions,
contained in law or regulations of any applicable governmental authority, the Security Agent may,
with respect to any sale of all or any part of such equity interests or assets:

limit purchasers to those who meet the requirements of such governmental authority or exemptive or safeharbor provision (as applicable) and/or make representations and undertakings satisfactory to the Security Agent
relating to compliance with such requirements and/or provisions; and/or

limit purchasers to persons who will agree, among other things to acquire such shares for their own account,
for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof;

(iv) the Security Agent and other Secured Parties shall not under any circumstances be required to
make representations, warranties or undertakings to any actual or proposed purchaser (other than

162


-----

customary representations in a security enforcement as to power to transfer the relevant equity
interests pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents) or to indemnify any actual or proposed
purchaser against any costs, liabilities or similar expenses or losses; and

(v) without limitation to the other circumstances of the sale or other disposition that the Security
Agent and such investment bank or accounting firm may take into consideration, the Security
Agent may (but is not required to) in all circumstances specify that no offer to purchase equity
interest or other assets will be entertained unless such offer:

A. is for all (and not some only) of the equity interests being sold or otherwise disposed;

B. is for cash consideration payable at closing (and therefore not including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any element of deferred compensation) and is not subject to any financing conditions;
and/or

C. contemplates a closing of the sale of the equity interests or other assets in not more than three
(3) months (or such longer period as the Security Agent may specify) from the time of
initiation of the sale or disposition process; and

(vi) a “right to participate”:

A. means any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that a Secured Party makes shall be
considered by the Security Agent or such investment bank or accounting firm against the
same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential
bidder. For the avoidance of doubt, if after having applied that same criteria, the offer or
indication of a potential offer made by a Secured Party is not considered by the Security
Agent or such investment bank or accounting firm to be sufficient to continue in the sale or
disposal process, such consideration being against the same criteria as any offer, or indication
of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder (such continuation may include
being invited to review additional information or being invited to have an opportunity to
make a subsequent or revised offer, whether in another round of bidding or otherwise) then
the right to participate of that Secured Party under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be
deemed to be satisfied; and

B. shall not apply if the Security Agent believes in good faith that it may (or there is a risk that it
may) result in a violation of any applicable laws or that it may (or there is a risk that it may)
result in a requirement for registration under any applicable securities laws.

For the purposes of paragraph (a) above, such investment bank or accounting firm may be instructed by the
Security Agent to take the limitations set out in subparagraphs (i) to (vi) (inclusive) above into account and to
formulate recommendations that are consistent with them.

**_Exercise of voting rights_**

Each Creditor (other than the Credit Facility Lenders, the Revolving Credit Facility Agent, the Existing
Notes Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee) will cast its vote
in any proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of
any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as
instructed by the Security Agent and the Security Agent shall give instructions for these purposes as directed by
the Instructing Group, provided that such instructions have been given in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Turnover_**

_Turnover by Primary Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any creditor in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities, the
Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the Existing Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities or the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities (the “Primary Creditors”) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of
any Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency event) other than in accordance with the
payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security,” that
Primary Creditor will, subject to certain exceptions:

(a) in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold that amount in
trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in

163


-----

accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the
amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Turnover by Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors and Subordinated Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor or any creditor of any
Subordinated Liabilities receives or recovers:

made, received or taken by the relevant creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any amount on account of, or
in relation to, any of such liabilities after the occurrence of an Secured Debt Acceleration Event or the
enforcement of any Transaction Security (a “Distress Event”) or as a result of any other litigation or
proceedings against a Debtor or a member of the Group (other than after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in respect of that Debtor or that member of the Group), other than, in each case, any
amount received or recovered in accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;_

(d) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any amount by way of set-off
in respect of any of such liabilities after the occurrence of a Distress Event; or

(e) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any distribution in cash or in
kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of such liabilities that is not made in
accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of
_Transaction Security” below and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an insolvency_

exceptions:

(i) in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (A) hold that amount
on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) promptly pay an amount equal to the
amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the

Notes Documents); and the balance, if any, in payment or distribution to the Security Providers, any

**_Release of the Guarantees and the security_**

_Non-Distressed Disposal_

In circumstances where a disposal of an asset of the Group which is subject to the Transaction Security is
not being effected (a) by enforcement of the Transaction Security; (b) at the request of the Instructing Group,
after the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (c) in the case of a disposal to a person or persons
outside the Group, after a Secured Debt Acceleration Event or a Distress Event has occurred (each a “Distressed
Disposal”) and is otherwise permitted by the Credit Facility Documents, the Existing Notes Documents, the Pari
Passu Debt Documents and the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents (together the “Senior Debt Documents,” and
such disposal, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent is
authorized (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document over the
relevant asset; and (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release the Transaction
Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document over the assets of that Debtor and the shares in and
assets of any of its subsidiaries, provided that if an asset which is the subject of a Non-Distressed Disposal is
transferred to another member of the Group the release of the Transaction Security must be permitted under the
terms of the Credit Facilities, the Existing Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents and, to the
extent that replacement Transaction Security is required from the transferee under the terms of the Debt
Documents, such Transaction Security will (subject to any other requirements relating to the release, retaking,
amendment or extension of the Transaction Security under the Debt Documents) be granted at the same time as
(or before) the relevant disposals are effected.

If any proceeds from a Non-Distressed Disposal are required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of any
of the Secured Liabilities or to be offered to any Secured Party pursuant to the terms of the Secured Debt

165


-----

Documents, then such proceeds will be applied in or towards payment of such Secured Liabilities or shall be
offered to the relevant Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of the relevant Secured Debt Documents and
the consent of any other party will not be required for that application.

_Distressed Disposal_

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
Security Agent is authorized: (a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to
release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor; (ii) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt
Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Primary Creditors), its liabilities as
guarantor in respect of the Debt Documents and any trading or other liabilities it may have to an Intra Group
Lender or another Debtor (“Other Liabilities”); and (iii) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor or another
Debtor over the relevant assets; and (b) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a holding
company of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that holding company and any
subsidiary of that holding company; (ii) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed
by the Issuer to the Primary Creditors), its liabilities as guarantor in respect of the Debt Documents and any
Other Liabilities; and (iii) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over the relevant assets.

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the
Security Agent is authorized if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a
holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities of that Debtor or holding company or any
subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company under the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed
by the Issuer to a Primary Creditor) or any liabilities owed by such Debtor, holding company or subsidiary to
another Debtor (“Debtor Liabilities”):

(i) if the Security Agent does not intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any
agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or all (but
not part) of such Debtor Liabilities; or

(ii) if the Security Agent does intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor
or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any agreement to
dispose of all (but not part) of such liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor and all or any part of
such Debtor Liabilities and any other liabilities under the Debt Documents, on behalf of the
relevant creditors and Debtors.

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the
Security Agent is authorized, if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a
holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent decides to transfer to another
Debtor all or any part of that Disposed Entity’s obligations (or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity) in respect of Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities, to enter into any agreement to agree the transfer
and acceptance of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on
behalf of the Debtors that owe such liabilities and the Debtors to which such liabilities are to be transferred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market
price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have an obligation to postpone
any Distressed Disposal or any disposal of Liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If on or after the first date on which Senior Unsecured Notes are issued but before the Senior Unsecured
Notes Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantees
will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

A. the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee has approved the release on the instructions of the
Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders; or

B. where shares or assets of a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(ii) all present and future obligations owed to the Secured Parties under the Credit Facility
Documents, Hedging Agreements, the Existing Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt

166


-----

Documents by a member of the Group, all or part of whose shares are pledged or charged in favor
of the Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such enforcement action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the Transaction
Security Documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of
a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

C. the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the finance parties under
the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Note Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors
(respectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged; and

D. the Credit Facility Agent, Existing Notes Trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) serve
a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same, in which case the
Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such purchaser
(or an affiliate of such purchaser); and

(i) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(ii) pursuant to a Public Auction; or

(iii) where a Financial Advisor confirms that the sale, disposal or transfer price is fair from a financial
point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, although there shall be no
obligation to postpone any such sale, disposal or transfer in order to achieve a higher price.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities owed to a
Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction
_Security,” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent_
that any disposal of liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities has occurred, as if that
disposal of liabilities or Debtor Liabilities had not occurred.

_In this section:_

of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Existing Notes, in accordance with the Existing Notes
Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining whether the Existing Noteholders of the required principal

relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents or, if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the
majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding relevant tranche of Pari Passu Debt, in accordance with
the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining whether the Pari Passu
Creditors of the required principal amount of relevant tranche of Pari Passu Debt have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, relevant Pari Passu Debt owned by any Debtor, or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with any Debtor (other than an
independent fund established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans or debt securities and
which has not been set up solely to make purchases of any of the commitments or amounts outstanding under the

holders holding at least a majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes, in
accordance with the relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining
whether the Senior Unsecured Noteholders of the required principal amount of the relevant tranche of Senior
Unsecured Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Senior Unsecured Notes owned by any
Debtor, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common
control with any Debtor other than an Independent Debt Fund, will be considered as though not outstanding
except that for the purpose of determining whether the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee will be protected in
relying on any such direction, approval, waiver or consent, only Senior Unsecured Notes that the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee knows are so owned will be disregarded.

**_Amendment_**

In addition to customary minor, technical or administrative matter amendments by the Security Agent, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that it may be amended with only the consent of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, the Existing Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders, the Senior Unsecured
Notes Required Holders, the Issuer and the Security Agent, unless it is an amendment, waiver or consent that has
the effect of changing or which relates to: (a) any amendment to the order of priority or subordination set forth in
the Intercreditor Agreement; (b) any amendment to the payment waterfall, turnover provisions or enforcement
provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement; (c) certain provisions relating to the giving of instructions to
the Security Agent or the exercise of discretion by the Security Agent; or (d) the amendment of provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, which shall not be made without consent of:

(i) the Credit Facility Lenders;

(ii) the Existing Notes Trustee (acting in accordance with the terms of each of the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Indentures);

(iii) the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee (acting in accordance with the terms of the relevant Senior
Unsecured Notes Indenture), insofar as the amendment or waiver might adversely affect the rights,
ranking, immunities or protections of the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee or the Senior Unsecured
Noteholders;

(iv) in the case of any Pari Passu Debt constituting an issuance of debt securities, the relevant Pari Passu
Debt Representative (acting in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents);

(v) in the case of any Pari Passu Debt constituting a credit facility, the Pari Passu Creditors in that tranche
of Pari Passu Debt;

168


-----

(vi) each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the
Hedge Counterparty);

(vii) the Issuer; and

(viii) the Security Agent.

If, however, an amendment, waiver or consent affects only one class of Secured Party and could not
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the interests of the other classes of Secured Party, only
agreement from the requisite affected class is required.

Subject to the paragraphs above and certain other exceptions, no amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor
Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any party to the
Intercreditor Agreement without the prior written consent of the affected party.

**_Option to purchase: Notes Creditors and Pari Passu Creditors_**

After a Distress Event, by giving not less than ten days’ prior written notice to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agent and, if applicable, the Hedge Counterparties, the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Creditor
Representative, at the direction and expense of and having obtained all necessary approvals from the Existing
Noteholders and Pari Passu Creditor Representative(s) (as applicable) (the “Purchasing Senior Secured
Creditors”), will have the right to acquire or procure that a nominee acquires by way of transfer all (but not part
only) of the rights and obligations of the Credit Facility Lenders and the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in
respect of Super Senior Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (the “Super Senior Acquisition
Debt”). If more than one Purchasing Senior Secured Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Super
Senior Acquisition Debt, each such Purchasing Senior Secured Creditor shall acquire the Super Senior
Acquisition Debt pro rata, in the proportion that its principal amount outstanding under the Existing Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes and its principal amount outstanding under the Pari Passu Debt Documents (“Senior
Secured Credit Participations”) bears to the aggregate Senior Secured Credit Participations of all the Purchasing
Senior Secured Creditors.

Any such purchase will be on terms which will include, without limitation, payment in full in cash of an
amount equal to the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities then outstanding and relevant hedging purchase amount (as
determined in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), including in respect of any broken funding costs, as
well as certain costs and expenses (including legal fees) of the Super Senior Creditors and Super Senior Hedge
Counterparties; after the transfer, no Super Senior Creditor or Super Senior Hedge Counterparty will be under
any actual or contingent liability to any Debtor or any other person under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Credit
Facility Document or any Hedging Agreement (in relation to Super Senior Hedging Liabilities only) for which it
is not holding cash collateral in an amount and on terms satisfactory to it; the purchasing holders of Existing
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and Pari Passu Creditors (other than the Existing Notes Trustee and the Pari
Passu Debt Representative(s)) indemnify each Super Senior Creditor and Super Senior Hedge Counterparty for
any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount received by such Super Senior Creditor or
Super Senior Hedge Counterparty; and the relevant transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, any
Super Senior Creditor, save that each Credit Facility Lender and Super Senior Hedge Counterparty will be
deemed to have given the following representations and warranties on the date of the transfer:

(a) in the case of a Credit Facility Lender, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party
interests (other than any arising under the relevant finance documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the Revolving Credit Facility finance documents or the Credit Facility
Documents purporting to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(b) in the case of a Super Senior Hedge Counterparty, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and thirdparty interests (other than any arising under the relevant Hedging Agreements or by operation of law)
of all rights and interests under the relevant Hedging Agreements purporting to be transferred by it by
that transfer;

(c) it has the power to enter into and make, and has taken all necessary action to authorize its entry into
and making of, that transfer;

(d) the Credit Facility Lenders and Super Senior Hedge Counterparties are satisfied with the results of any
“know your client” or other similar checks relating to the identity of any person that they are required
by law to carry out in relation to such a transfer; and

169


-----

(e) the Senior Unsecured Noteholders have not exercised the purchase rights described in “—Option to
_purchase: Senior Unsecured Noteholders” below or, having exercised such rights, have failed to_
complete the acquisition of the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities under the
Hedging Agreements, the Existing Notes Liabilities and the Pari Passu Liabilities.

**_Option to purchase: Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

The Senior Unsecured Noteholders (the “Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors”) may, after a
Distress Event, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Credit Facility Agent, the Existing Notes Trustee
and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) (together, the “Relevant Representatives”), require the transfer to them
(or to a nominee or nominees) of all (but not part only) of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the
Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Acquisition Debt”). If more than
one Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Senior Secured
Acquisition Debt, each such Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor shall acquire the Senior Secured
Acquisition Debt pro rata, in the proportion that its principal amount outstanding under the Senior Unsecured
Notes Documents (“Senior Unsecured Credit Participations”) bears to the aggregate Senior Unsecured Credit
Participations of all the Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors.

Any such purchase will be on terms that will include, without limitation, payment in full in cash of an
amount equal to the Secured Liabilities then outstanding, including in respect of any broken funding costs, as
well as certain costs and expenses (including legal fees) of the creditors in respect of the relevant Secured
Liabilities; after the transfer, no Credit Facility Lender, Hedge Counterparty, Existing Notes Creditor or Pari
Passu Creditor will be under any actual or contingent liability to any Debtor or any other person under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Credit Facility Document, any Hedging Agreement, any Existing Notes Document
or any Pari Passu Debt Document for which it is not holding cash collateral in an amount and on terms
satisfactory to it; the Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors, other than the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee (or if required by the Credit Facility Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Noteholders or Pari Passu Creditors,
a third party acceptable to the Credit Facility Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Notes Creditors or Pari Passu
Creditors), shall provide on the date of the transfer an indemnity to each Credit Facility Lender and each other
finance party under such Credit Facility Document, Hedge Counterparty, Notes Creditor or Pari Passu Creditor
(each, an “Indemnified Party”) for any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount received by
such Indemnified Party; and the relevant transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, any Primary
Creditor, save that each such Primary Creditor will be deemed to have given the following representations and
warranties on the date of the transfer:

(a) in the case of a Credit Facility Lender, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party
interests (other than any arising under the Credit Facility Documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the Credit Facility Documents purporting to be transferred by it by that
transfer;

(b) in the case of a Hedge Counterparty, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party interests
(other than any arising under the Hedging Agreements or by operation of law) of all rights and interests
under the Hedging Agreements purporting to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(c) in the case of an Existing Notes Creditor, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third- party
interests (other than any arising under the Existing Notes Documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the Existing Notes Documents purporting to be transferred by it by that
transfer;

(d) in the case of a Pari Passu Creditor, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and third-party interests
(other than any arising under the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents or by operation of law), of all
rights and interests under the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents purporting to be transferred by it by
that transfer;

(e) it has the power to enter into and make, and has taken all necessary action to authorize its entry into
and making of, that transfer; and

(i) the transferring Primary Creditors and Hedge Counterparties are satisfied with the results of any
“know your client” or other similar checks relating to the identity of any person that they or any
Representative are required by law to carry out in relation to such a transfer.

**Description of the Senior Secured Notes**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”
under the heading “—Certain definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,”
references to the “Issuer” refer only to Parts Europe S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, references to “we,”
“our,” and “us” refer to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, references to the “Parent Guarantor” refer
only to Parts Holding Europe S.A.S. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, references to “Luxco 6” refer only to
Dakar Acquisition S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, references to “Luxco 5” refer only to Dakar (BC)
LuxCo S.à r.l. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, and references to the “Sponsor SPVs” refer only to Luxco 6 and
Luxco 5.

The Issuer will issue €300.0 million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes due 2025
(the “Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of, 2020 (the “Indenture”), between,
_inter alios, the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, the Sponsor SPVs, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such_
capacity the “Trustee”), and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security
_Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The_
Indenture will not incorporate or include terms of, or be subject to any of the provisions of, the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Senior Secured Notes” also
refers to “book entry interests” in the Senior Secured Notes, as defined herein. The Senior Secured Notes will be
secured by the Collateral as described under “—Security.”

The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the Offering to (i) fund the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate
Notes Redemption, (ii) fund the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Redemption and (iii) pay the
fees and expenses Incurred in connection with the Refinancing.

The Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms
of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and
security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement
action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of
the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture and the
Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such
documents are available as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance:

   - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer
under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes
and certain future Hedging Obligations (if any);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries,
including the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and certain
future Hedging Obligations (if any), secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior
Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets;

173


-----

   - be Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors;

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors and, to the extent drawings are borrowed by such
Subsidiaries, obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility;

   - mature on, 2025; and

   - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-entry, delivery and
_form”)._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement, however, provides
that the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only
after certain super senior priority obligations have been repaid in full, including (i) obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain future Hedging Obligations (if any).

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes will be Guaranteed,
jointly and severally, by the Parent Guarantor and Autodistribution (each, a “Guarantor” and each such
Guarantee, a “Notes Guarantee”). In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain
_covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the_
future.

The Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

   - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including such Guarantor’s obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes
and certain future Hedging Obligations, if any);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor,
including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and future Hedging
Obligations (if any) that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee, to
the extent of the value of such property and assets; and

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness, including obligations to trade
creditors, of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable
law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, under
French corporate benefit rules, the Notes Guarantee of Autodistribution is expected to be limited in value to an
amount not greater than the outstanding amount under existing proceeds loans, which is approximately
€330 million and corresponds to the aggregate of the existing proceeds loans made available to on-lend the
proceeds of prior issuances of Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes to Autodistribution. Other
Indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_indebtedness and the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the_
_Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our_
_indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case_
_may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce_

174


-----

_your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and_
enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations
described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the security interests.”_

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

**Principal and maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €300.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Senior Secured Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior
Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will
not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not
be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay. The Issuer will make each
interest payment for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are Global Notes to the Holders of record of the Senior
Secured Notes at the close of business (in the relevant clearing system) on the Clearing System Business Day
immediately before the due date for such payment, where “Clearing System Business Day” means a day on
which each clearing system for which the Global Note is being held is open for business, or to the extent
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below) have been issued, to the Holders of record of the Senior Secured
Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding each interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing
on, 2021.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already
been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, and we may issue an unlimited principal
amount of additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”) under the Indenture from
time to time after this Offering. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in
compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens”). Any series of Additional Senior Secured Notes_
shall have terms substantially identical to the initial Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, except in respect of
any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) supplied to the
Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall
bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates
on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the
record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis
upon which such interest will be calculated;

175


-----

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be denominated and
the currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Senior Secured Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Senior Secured Notes.

Additional Senior Secured Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as
the initial Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, in some cases may not be fungible with the initial Senior
Secured Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as provided in the Indenture, will be
allocated a separate ISIN and common code, as applicable. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured
Notes offered hereby and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture.

**Methods of receiving payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its
nominee).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for_
such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by
check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Secured
Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes”
below.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents (the “Paying Agent”) for the Senior Secured Notes for
so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial
Services DAC. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior
Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the
Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Senior Secured Notes
without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. For so long as Senior Secured Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer
will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment obligation
resulting from a Change of Control, will be Guaranteed, jointly and severally, on the Issue Date by the
Guarantors, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles. The Guarantors also
guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and the Existing Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes subject to certain guarantee limitations as set out therein.

In addition, as described below under “—Certain covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that Guarantee the

176


-----

Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain other Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture may also be
required under the Indenture to enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes
and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions or to comply with corporate
benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, under French corporate
benefit rules, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors which are subsidiaries of the Issuer and the
amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds
of the Senior Secured Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any
indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under
intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by
such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. As a consequence, in particular, the Guarantee of Autodistribution
is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the aggregate amount outstanding under the
existing proceeds loan of €330 million made available to on-lend the proceeds of prior issuances of Existing
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes to Autodistribution. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and
_the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the_
_Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the_
_Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the_
_Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be_
_favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under_
_the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” In addition, he validity and enforceability_
of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in
“Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and
_the security interests.”_

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the Issuer depends on the
cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.
Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those
Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if
any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior
Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade
creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than any Guarantors)
and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As at and for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2020, the revenue, EBITDA and total assets (excluding equity investments in
wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) of the non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries
represented 93.2%, 74.7% and 69.7% of the consolidated revenue, consolidated EBITDA and consolidated total
assets of the Parent Guarantor, respectively, and, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, the
non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries would have had approximately €245 million of Indebtedness, of which
approximately €156 million would have been incurred in connection with lease liabilities. Although the
Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not
impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

**_Notes Guarantees release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than the Parent Guarantor) will terminate and release:

   - upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of any Capital Stock of the relevant
Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company as a result of which such Guarantor
would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture;

177


-----

   - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes issued under the Indenture or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge
of the Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and discharge”;

   - in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

   - as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

   - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”;_

   - with respect to a Guarantor that is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation
or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—
_The Subsidiary Guarantor”; or_

   - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; provided that, subject to the exceptions and limitations
described in the proviso under “—Additional Guarantees,” such Guarantor fully and unconditionally
provides a substantially equivalent Notes Guarantee as soon as reasonably practicable following such
Permitted Reorganization.

The Notes Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor will terminate and be released upon the circumstances
described in the third, fourth, fifth and eighth bullet point set forth above and under “—Certain covenants—
_Merger and consolidation—The Parent Guarantor.”_

Upon any occurrence giving rise to the release of a Notes Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject
to the receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture, shall take all reasonably necessary
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by
the Trustee without any additional consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the
Trustee. The Issuer may in its sole discretion elect to have any Notes Guarantee remain in place, as opposed to
being released.

**Transfer and exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without
interest coupons, as follows:

   - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A
Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

   - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes,
the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

   - Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

   - Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully
under “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in
Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to
customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

178


-----

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation
_S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written_
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a BookEntry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will
become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000
in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee
at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes
in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be
Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and certain
perfection requirements, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over:

(1) all issued Capital Stock of Luxco 6;

(2) all issued Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor;

(3) the Parent Guarantor’s material bank account and the Parent Guarantor’s material intragroup
receivables;

(4) all issued Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings);

(5) certain assets of the Issuer, including the Capital Stock of Autodistribution, Magenta Auto Pièces S.A.
and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, the Issuer’s material bank accounts and the Issuer’s material
intragroup receivables;

179


-----

(6) the Capital Stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest
S.A.S. held by Autodistribution;

(7) Autodistribution’s material bank accounts; and

(8) Autodistribution’s material intragroup receivables (collectively, the “Collateral”).

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary therein, the Indenture will provide that any obligation to cause
a Restricted Subsidiary to accede to the Indenture as a Guarantor or to pledge assets as Collateral will be limited
pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles.

The assets that comprise the Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes and certain future Hedging Obligations. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the
covenants described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain covenants—
_Limitations on Liens,” the relevant security providers will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in_
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including
Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral only after certain super senior priority obligations have been repaid in full,
including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to
the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain future Hedging Obligations.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent as parallel debt
creditor on behalf of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are
secured by the Collateral. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests — France — Parallel debt — trust.” Any other_
security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, any
Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to any
Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the Issuer,
the Guarantors and the Sponsor SPVs, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain
exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate
the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part
of the Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash
dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits
or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing).

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the PGE Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes as well as certain Hedging Obligations and any
Additional Senior Secured Notes and may also secure certain future Indebtedness, certain of which is entitled to
payment from the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Senior Secured Notes. The
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Senior Secured Notes
on the Issue Date. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at
all. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the
_Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or_
_diluted under certain circumstances.”_

180


-----

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan, (b) the counterparties under certain future Hedging Obligations,
(c) the Trustee and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture, (d) the Trustee and the holders
of the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted
to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
which provides, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan, the
Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, certain future Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes
are secured equally and ratably by first-ranking Security Interests; provided, however, that the Holders of Senior
Secured Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain super senior
priority obligations have been paid in full, including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the
PGE Loan, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to
the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain future
Hedging Obligations. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In
addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the
Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness, including Indebtedness that is entitled to
rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral. See
“—Release of Liens,” “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain definitions—
_Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by
the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the
Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties
(including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
PGE Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and, if applicable, the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, including France, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of security interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created
under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in
certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The security
_over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Notes.”_

Each of the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall procure that each of their
respective Subsidiaries shall, at their own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such
assurances as the Security Agent may require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral
in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security
Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization
of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all
powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the
Collateral. Each of the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall procure that each of their
respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that
property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the
Security Agent may request.

The Indenture will also provide that the Security Documents may be enforced only in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture will provide and the Intercreditor Agreement provides that, to the extent
permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents
on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As a consequence of such contractual
provisions, Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject

181


-----

to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. Each Holder, by
accepting a Senior Secured Note, appoints the Security Agent as its agent under the Security Documents and
authorizes it to act as such. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders may, individually or collectively, take any direct
action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the
Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security
Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture without requiring any consent of the Holders.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security
Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture have been
discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture may be
released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Sponsor SPVs, the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency,
bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge
to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders
may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_indebtedness and the Notes.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts, and the Indenture will restrict, the ability of the Holders and the
Trustee, on behalf of the Holders, to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security
Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan, certain hedging counterparties and certain future indebtedness
permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank senior to the Senior Secured
Notes. These limitations are described under “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the security interests.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in_
relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan, the holders of the Existing Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee
have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent
to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness,
including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan, the
holders of the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by
the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to
have, authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that
are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security
Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent on its behalf.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Collateral will be released from the Liens over such Collateral under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than any Liens over the Capital
Stock of the Parent Guarantor and the Parent Guarantor’s material intragroup receivables owed to
Luxco 6, if any) to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation”), if such sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of
_assets and Subsidiary stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (b) any_
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of
Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging
receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant
property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Senior
Secured Notes following such sale or disposal (and subject to the Agreed Security Principles);

182


-----

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest”;_

(4) as described under the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Liens”;

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as
provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(6) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”;_

(9) (i) in respect of Collateral granted by a Sponsor SPV, upon a Change of Control (other than in the
context of an enforcement of Collateral granted by a Sponsor SPV not involving a release in
accordance with the next paragraph below) or (ii) in respect of Collateral granted by Luxco 5, upon the
final release and discharge of the Liens granted over such Collateral in respect of the Existing Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes (the “Luxco 5 Release”); or

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with
an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
(b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest.”_

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action requested by the
Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, or the relevant Security Document, as applicable. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless
action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and
rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of Liens has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by accepting such Senior Secured
Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on
its behalf).

See the sections entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The security over
_the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Notes” and “Description of certain financing_
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

183


-----

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Additional
_intercreditor agreements.”_

**Optional redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for taxation reasons,” the Senior
Secured Notes are not redeemable until January, 2022.

On and after January, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Secured
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if
any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month

Prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture (including the original principal amount
of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an
aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of
% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the original
principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under the Indenture (excluding
Senior Secured Notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) remain outstanding after each such
redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem during each calendar year
up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the original principal amount
of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption
price of 103.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, prior to January, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior
Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Calculation of the Applicable Premium_**

“Applicable Premium” means the greater of:

(a) 1% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Note; and

(b) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price of such Senior Secured Note
at January, 2022 (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being
set forth in the table above under “—Optional redemption” (excluding accrued and unpaid
interest)), plus (2) all required interest payments due on such Senior Secured Note to and
including January, 2022 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon the

184


-----

redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate at such redemption date plus 50
basis points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Secured Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the
Trustee or any Paying Agent.

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct
obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as
officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that have become publicly available at
least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial
statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected in good
faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) most nearly equal to the period
from the redemption date to January, 2022; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date
to January, 2022, is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of
Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation
(calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the
Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption
date to January, 2022, is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations
of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used; provided further,
that in no case shall the Bund Rate be less than zero.

**_General_**

Notice of any redemption or offer to purchase, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, Change of
Control, Alternate Offer, Asset Disposition Offer (each as defined herein) or other transaction or event or
otherwise, may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion or occurrence thereof, and any such
redemption, offer to purchase or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering, Change of
Control, Asset Disposition or other transaction or event, as the case may be. The Issuer may redeem Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of
redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice
may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption dates. In
addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state
that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (but no more
than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent, unless such notice was sent in
connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Alternate Offer, in which case the redemption or repurchase
date may be delayed by more than 60 days) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole
discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed, or that such
notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such
conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer to purchase
that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to
such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice” below. If the optional
redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the
close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured
Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer of any series of Senior Secured Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such offer in
lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than

185


-----

60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Senior Secured
Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each
other Holder in such offer (which may be less than par) plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the redemption date, subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to
or on the redemption date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Senior
Secured Notes in a tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, as
applicable, Senior Secured Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any
Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender
offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, as applicable.

The Issuer, its direct and indirect equityholders, including the Initial Investors, any of its Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates and members of our management may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time
and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

**No sinking fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes.

**Redemption at maturity**

On, 2025, the Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been previously
redeemed or purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon
and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**Selection and notice**

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Senior Secured
Notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-entry, delivery and form,” based on a method that most
nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Paying Agent or the Registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless
otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee, the Paying
Agent and the Registrar will not be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For Senior Secured Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear for communication to entitled
account Holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are
listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer
will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes and, in
connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a
Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will
be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Secured Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or
portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for taxation reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon
giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (which
notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with

186


-----

accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due and which
will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuer determines
in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice or guidance) (each of the foregoing in clauses
(1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would
be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor,
only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can
make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided
by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a
new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and
become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a
Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior
Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to
the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to
its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional
Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts
as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without
further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including
the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional
amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder

187


-----

(or beneficial owner) in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such
deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have
been received by each Holder (or beneficial owner) in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note
or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant
Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a
citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment or
having a place of management present or deemed present in, or being physically present in, the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the
exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or
the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor
addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such
matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such
Tax but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior
Secured Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date on
which the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that
the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Notes been
presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the Senior
Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment by or on behalf of
a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant
Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state
of the European Union;

(7) any Taxes imposed pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or otherwise
imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as of the Issue
Date (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future
regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any similar law or regulation
implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or
settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have
been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior
Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified
copies or other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such

188


-----

copies or other evidence shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made
available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” there
is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto)
or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, issuance,
registration, initial resale, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Senior Secured Notes, any
Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case,
in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this Offering and limited, solely to the extent of
such Taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the
Senior Secured Notes, to any such Taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses
(1) through (3) and (5) through (7)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or
any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any
Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control Triggering Event**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a Change of Control Offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or concurrently delivered a
redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (provided that Senior_
Secured Notes of €100,000 or less may only be tendered and repurchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to
the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash (the “Change of Control
_Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and_
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date
falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the
Issuer will deliver (or cause to be delivered) notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by
first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control
_Triggering Event,” and that all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of_
Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

189


-----

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days
from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as
described below;

(3) that any Senior Secured Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue
interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Senior Secured
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Senior Secured Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer will be required to surrender such Senior Secured Notes, with the form entitled “Option of
Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Senior Secured Notes completed or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to the paying agent
specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third
Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders whose Senior Secured Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Senior
Secured Notes and such new Senior Secured Notes will be equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Senior
Secured Notes must be equal to at least €100,000 or any integral multiple or €1,000 in excess thereof;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that
the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering
Event and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than
60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such
repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of
Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the
Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or
waived;

(8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control Triggering
Event covenant, that a Holder must follow; and

(9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Senior Secured Notes and their election to
require the Issuer to purchase such Senior Secured Notes; provided that the applicable paying agent
receives, not later than the close of business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of
the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of
the Senior Secured Notes, the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes tendered for purchase, and a
statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Senior Secured Notes, or a specified portion
thereof, and its election to have such Senior Secured Notes purchased.

While the Senior Secured Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the
purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or withdraw such election through the facilities of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, subject to the applicable rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in
the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the
staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer;

190


-----

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Senior Secured Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions
thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of
Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds
may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us. Subject to the limitations discussed
below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that
could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or
credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on
_Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in_
principal amount of all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change
of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the
Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Senior
Secured Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has
purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Except as described
above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made
in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event,
if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control
Offer or Alternate Offer.

A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Senior Secured Notes, Guarantees and/or
Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such
consents).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially
_all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to_
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control
Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Senior Secured Notes may require the Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of
_Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of_
all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes.

**IPO Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”), the Issuer shall be entitled
to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the

191


-----

Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date
specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that: (i) references to the Issuer and Restricted
Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted
Subsidiaries from time to time; (ii) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions
shall exclude any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed
at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown
Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and provided, further, that nothing in
this paragraph, including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action related
thereto taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to but in connection with it being deemed to be the Issuer, shall,
or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the
Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings,
covenants or Events of Default, as applicable, in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the other collateral documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown
Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or
otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute
or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each
Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any
security granted by any such Holding Company; (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each Person
which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Debtor” (as such
term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Issuer,
that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as
a Debtor and shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as a Debtor); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to
become party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor; and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from
or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a Debtor
as a consequence of this paragraph, any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any Person be a Debtor or that any liabilities
or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be
deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this provision).

The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any
amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or the other
collateral documents required by the Issuer in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in
order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this covenant (collectively,
an “IPO Pushdown”); provided, that such amendment or replacement will not impose any personal obligations
on the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto or adversely affect the personal rights,
protections, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee, the Security Agent or any other
agents party thereto under the Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or collateral documents. The Trustee, the
Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders
of the Senior Secured Notes (without any consent by the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes) to execute any
such amended or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so
on the reasonable request of and at the cost of the Issuer).

For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer notified to the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in
relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a Holding Company
of such Restricted Subsidiary).

If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant in
relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the
occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is

192


-----

revoked in accordance with this paragraph: (i) the provisions of clauses (i) to (vii) of the first paragraph of this
covenant shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a
replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any Person party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a “Debtor” has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-clause (vii) of the
first paragraph of this covenant in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably
practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in the immediately preceding paragraph shall prohibit or otherwise
restrict the Issuer from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO
Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly
constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by
any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or
otherwise).

**Certain covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur

to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, provided
that the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this sub-clause (1) by
Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors will not exceed the greater of €60.0 million and 27.5% of
Consolidated EBITDA; and (2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
no greater than 3.75 to 1.0.

Subsidiary of Indebtedness of any joint venture in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not exceeding the greater of €30.0 million and 14.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,

Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and

193


-----

(4)


any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted

considered Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including any Parent
Senior Notes) and that is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the Indenture; provided, however,
that the proceeds of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (e) shall be excluded for

not to exceed (I) the greater of €22.0 million and 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of
Incurrence, plus (II) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving pro forma effect to

would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction
and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness and (y) to the extent that the Indebtedness Incurred under

owning such assets, provided that the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental or
improvement or is created within 365 days thereafter, and (iii) Leases other than in the ordinary course
of business and, in each case, any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such

or a Restricted Subsidiary and other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated
Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution or an Excluded Amount) of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash
Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted
Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (18) of the third paragraph of the covenant
described below under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary Incurs Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received
or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to
the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph
and clauses (1), (6) and (18) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon; and_

(14) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness consisting of local lines of

Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant that is secured by a
Lien on the Collateral that is accorded super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of
enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(including the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan) may not be reclassified;

(3) in any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any provision of this
covenant or secured pursuant to the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens” is or may be based
on Consolidated EBITDA, the amount that may be Incurred and/or secured under such provisions shall
be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, restructure, defease or
discharge any Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this covenant or secured pursuant to the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on
_Liens,” the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur and/or secured_
pursuant to this covenant and/or the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens” shall not be deemed
to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations
in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such
Lien will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such
refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue);

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

196


-----

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),
(11), (13) or (14) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(9) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant, nor to be the
Incurrence of a Lien under the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens”; provided that the Lien
securing such originally Incurred Preferred Stock or Indebtedness was secured in accordance with the
Indenture. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value
thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount,
or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness;

(10) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing; and

(11) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” or any Permitted Collateral
Lien, the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or use of clauses
(1) through (14) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and
including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the
Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into
or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date)
or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other
provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed
or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date
pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date
for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture,
and, to the extent the usage of clauses (1) through (14) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be
deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such
amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Issuer
may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.

197


-----

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the “Euro Equivalent” of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro
Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the Euro Equivalent
of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated
in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts
payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into
account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s
or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or
in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any
such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its Capital Stock
other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any direct or
indirect Parent of the Issuer held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than
in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire
for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any
Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment,
purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other
than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person (each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase,
redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to
in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted Payment”).

Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph, and, in each case, any Permitted Payments or
Restricted Payments made prior the Issue Date pursuant to similar provisions included in any of the
indentures governing the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility)

Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or
any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the AD Acquisition

with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable securities, received by the

or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the
Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) from the disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the disposition or repayment of
any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment made after the AD Acquisition Completion Date;

(v) in the case of the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or all of the
assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or

100% of such amount received in cash and the fair market value of any property or marketable
securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such redesignation,
merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, excluding the amount of any Investment in such
Unrestricted Subsidiary that constituted a Permitted Investment made pursuant to clause (11) of
the definition of “Permitted Investment”; and

(vi) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary after the
AD Acquisition Completion Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such
dividend or distribution does not reduce the amount of Investments outstanding under clauses
(11) or (18) of the definition of “Permitted Investment”;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the_
preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included in the foregoing clauses (iv),
(v) or (vi). The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding
sentence shall be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts described in this paragraph, the “Excluded
_Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments_
pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts
result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities received in
contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control Triggering
Event pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose of the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or
assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer so that a Change
of Control Triggering Event would not occur (that is, without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or
assets or marketable securities, a Change of Control Triggering Event would have occurred) and (3) no Change
of Control Offer is made in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) any Restricted Payment made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the exercise of a
conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional
shares pursuant to clause (11) of this paragraph) for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially
concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a
substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than the issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preference Shares or as an Excluded Contribution or Excluded Amount) of the Issuer;
_provided, however, that to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value (as_

securities, from such sale of Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution
will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that, in each case, is permitted to be
Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” above;

(4) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated
Indebtedness:

(a) (i) from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted under “—Limitation on sales of assets and
_Subsidiary stock,” but only if the Issuer shall have first complied with the terms described under_
“—Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock” and purchased all Senior Secured Notes

**_Limitation on Liens_**

None of Luxco 5 (prior to the Luxco 5 Release), Luxco 6, the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer will, and the
Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien
upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the
Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is
securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does
not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the
Senior Secured Notes and all payments due under the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or
prior to (in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness) the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes
Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged without any further action by the Trustee or the Security Agent upon (i) the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of
_Liens.”_

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to
any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit
Facility and the PGE Loan), (b) the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the indenture governing the
Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents,

Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness
Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or
into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the
purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer, the Successor Issuer or the
Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (each as defined under “—Merger and consolidation”), any Subsidiary
thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer or

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are (i) no less favorable in
any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of
Senior Management of the Issuer) or (ii) customary in comparable financings and where, in the case of
this sub-clause (ii), the Issuer determines at the time of Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such

make principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock
of the joint venture;

imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person
of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or
assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the Senior
Secured Notes or the Indenture, together with the security documents associated therewith, and the
Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management of the Issuer) or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in
the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the
Issuer are customarily Incurred in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing and that are

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition
unless:

less than the fair market value of the Capital Stock, property or other assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such

as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in
respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness and Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that is no longer a

each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in sub-clauses (a) through (g) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds of the
Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable,
to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; provided, however, that, in
connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (1), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so
prepaid, repaid, purchase or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem (a) the Senior Secured Notes and/or (b) Indebtedness (other than the Senior

Notes (including Indebtedness with super priority status in respect of the proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral) at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such
applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets
which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) and at a price of no more
than 100% of the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption;

(2) purchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided, however, that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected
to purchase any amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a price not less than par, to the extent Holders
elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount
of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered, and such amount shall not increase the
amount of Excess Proceeds;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clauses (1) through (6) of
this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as a
permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration
of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
_Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce_

206


-----

revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by
the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day, if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been
entered into after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €40.0 million and 18.5% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will be
required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition
Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than)
100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu
Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants
contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any
Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders,
collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate
principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating
the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by
converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer
that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition
Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period
of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
_Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it_
elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition
_Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior_
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that
such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the
terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not
later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a
new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent),
upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note

207


-----

will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so
accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of
this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed
to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition offer prior to the
expiration of the 365-day (or 545-day, as applicable) period mentioned in this covenant.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €15.0 million
and 7.0% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€30.0 million and 14.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related
transactions have been approved or ratified by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested members
of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(B) of the third paragraph of the covenant_
described under “—Limitations on Restricted Payments”) and any agreement related to such Restricted
Payments or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs
(1)(b), (2), (11) and (14) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Capital Stock, options, other equity-related
investments or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise

collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar
agreement and other compensation arrangements, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans

employees);

as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed,

replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the
extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and
performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to
which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax return,
or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or
management purposes in the ordinary course of business; provided that payments under such Tax
Sharing Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described under
clause (7) of the definition of “Parent Expenses” and that the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services which are
fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the
Issuer (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or an Associate or similar entity, including any joint
venture, that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock, or Subordinated

their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any
Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; provided further that
such Subordinated Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified, will be deemed to be
Subordinated Shareholder Funding for all purposes under the Indenture;

favorable terms and (iii) in the case of securities, the investment constitutes less than 5% of the issue
amount of such securities, and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such transaction is
with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders) and such Affiliates are treated
no more favorably than all other holders of such class generally; and

(17) transactions related to a Permitted Change of Control, the payment of Permitted Change of Control

Guarantor, a report containing a description of such event,

_provided that the reports required in each of clause (1) and (2) above shall include in such report a reasonably_
detailed description of material differences, if any, between the financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and
the Issuer for any period after the Issue Date.

210


-----

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to post such report on the Issuer’s website. The Issuer will also provide copies of
all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the
Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the
Exchange so require, to the Exchange.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be
described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may,
in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as
provided below, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or any Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not
of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to
contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Parent Guarantor’s (a) total revenue or
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent quarter for which annual or
quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports” will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer or any Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if
filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications,
exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such
Parent, as applicable, is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

The Issuer may comply with the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant by providing
consolidated financial information and reports of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries instead of the Parent Guarantor.
The Issuer may also comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant
by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer (if such entity is
different from the Parent Guarantor) so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) (a) meet the
requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2) of this covenant as if references
to the Parent Guarantor therein were references to such Parent and (b) include condensed consolidated financial
information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Issuer on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the foregoing
requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent or IPO
Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated
markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Paris Stock Exchange) and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO
Entity is subject to the Admission and Disclosure Standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to
trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of
equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange or the Paris Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such

211


-----

annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would
be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange pursuant to such Admission and Disclosure Standards (or
the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or
the Paris Stock Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided, that
such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Paris Stock Exchange, as applicable, the
Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports” covenant is for
informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

**_Merger and consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer,
lease, sell or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
_Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European_

reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an

transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as
applicable, would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as applicable, and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the terms of the Indenture and an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that in the case of the Successor Issuer, such supplemental indenture (if any) has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as
to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor Person
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

212


-----

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “Merger
_and consolidation—The Issuer” covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted_
Subsidiary of the Issuer.

_The Parent Guarantor_

The Parent Guarantor will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign,
convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Parent Guarantor is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Parent Guarantor”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member
state of the European Union, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor
Parent Guarantor (if not the Parent Guarantor) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Parent Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture and (b) all obligations
of the Parent Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents (or the Successor Parent Guarantor shall have entered into security documents
creating Liens over the relevant Collateral on substantially the same terms as the corresponding
Security Documents then in force), as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Successor Parent Guarantor as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Parent Guarantor or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; and

(3) the Parent Guarantor or the Successor Parent Guarantor, as applicable, shall have delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the terms of the Indenture and
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, in the case of the Successor Parent Guarantor, such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid
and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may
rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor, which
properties and assets, if held by the Parent Guarantor instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent Guarantor on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to
be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent Guarantor.

The Successor Parent Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Parent Guarantor under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets,
the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or its Notes Guarantee.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

_The Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement substantially concurrently with such
consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition) will, directly or
indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of
all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the other Person is the Issuer or, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any Restricted Subsidiary that is
a Subsidiary Guarantor or becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor substantially concurrently with such
consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease, sell or other disposition;

213


-----

(2) (a) either (x) a Subsidiary Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable (such resulting, surviving or transferee Person, the “Successor Subsidiary Guarantor”); and
(b) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing; or

(3) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the
Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply
to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Subsidiary
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor; (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor
from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another
Subsidiary Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the
Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer”
shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining
with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however,
that clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (1) through (3) under the heading “—The
_Subsidiary Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction._

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

None of Luxco 5 (prior to the Luxco 5 Release), Luxco 6, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer shall, and the
Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit
of the Trustee and the Holders, and none of Luxco 5 (prior to the Luxco 5 Release), Luxco 6, the Parent
Guarantor or the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person
other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described
in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any
interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) Luxco 5 (prior to the Luxco 5 Release), Luxco 6, the
Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable) and the Security Agent may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for
the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) Luxco 5 (prior to the Luxco 5 Release), Luxco 6, the
Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable) and the Security Agent may amend,
extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the
purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization or a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth
under “—Merger and Consolidation,” (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the
Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity,
mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) Luxco 5 (prior to the Luxco 5 Release), Luxco 6,
the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable) and the Security Agent may
amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders of the Senior Secured Notes in
any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (v) above, the Security Documents may not be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (a) a solvency opinion,
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (b) a certificate from the

214


-----

Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the
solvency of the Issuer or the relevant Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, or (c) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its
satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Revolving Credit Facility) unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on
which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes
Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor
to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee would be inconsistent with the Agreed
Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous
restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes)
other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (2) undertaken in
connection with, such Notes Guarantee which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on
such Guarantor’s liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantees releases.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (1) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the
Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or (2) there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor
as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate
any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the
Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Certain insolvency law considerations
_and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**_Additional intercreditor agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7), (11) or (13) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness

215


-----

in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially
the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided
that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement,
(2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to
the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured
Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the
Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or
(8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material
respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer
shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and waivers,” and
the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Suspension of covenants on achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status
and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have Investment
Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions
will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock”;

216


-----

(6) the provisions of clause (3) of the covenant described under “—Merger and consolidation—The
_Issuer”;_

(7) “—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

(8) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary,”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action
taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The covenant set forth under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not
during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension_
Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant set
forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate transactions,” and (b) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on restrictions on distribution from Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the
second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on restrictions on distribution from Restricted
_Subsidiaries.”_

In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date
on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes
no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in
the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition
for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged
to notify Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Status.

**_Financial calculations for Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted
Payments and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such
option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether
any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed
to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are
entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable notice, declaration of a Restricted Payment or
similar event), if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments,
Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the
relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and
conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been

217


-----

complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness
is committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial
statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its
sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which
case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of
such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios,
tests or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after
the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related
thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and
Asset Dispositions) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will
be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin contained in any financing
commitment documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as
reasonably determined by the Issuer in good faith.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets
for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test
Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such
ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or total assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to
such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or
failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions
(including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction
was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been
complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default),
such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and
such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating
the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such
Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which
such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for
redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is
terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any
such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition
Transaction, except that in the case of an acquisition, merger or consolidation, any calculation of Consolidated
EBITDA for purposes other than Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or the making of Restricted Payments (in
each case, not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) or the calculation of the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event shall not reflect such transaction until it
has been consummated.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Indenture when due
and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary or, solely in connection with
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” Luxco 5 (prior to the Luxco 5 Release) and Luxco 6, to_
comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes with their respective other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether
such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default: (a) is
caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the

218


-----

expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or (b) results in the
acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration provision”), and, in each
case the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates an amount equal to the greater of €45.0 million and 20.5% of Consolidated
EBITDA or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”) (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Permitted Reorganization);

(6) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of an amount equal to the greater of €45.0 million and 20.5% of Consolidated
EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for),
which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes
final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral
having a fair market value in excess of an amount equal to the greater of €20.0 million and 9.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, or any
such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable
and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Notes Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor or a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to
be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the
Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or the Parent Guarantor or
any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its
Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) the Issuer
does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) as applicable, of this
paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and
the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture to be due and
payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and
payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event
of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness,
or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after
the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior
Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all
existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

219


-----

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as
provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Additionally, the
Indenture shall not include any provisions incorporating, giving effect to, or otherwise reflecting the provisions
of Section 316(b) of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture
by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default
(except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior
Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived with the consent of Holders holding
90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding under the Indenture)) and
rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the
payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense
caused by taking or not taking such action. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest
when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of such security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given
the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers
to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is
unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior
to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to
it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture
will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the
Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the
Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any
Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding
notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of

220


-----

any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is
taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default
for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any
such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances,
but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction in its sole discretion. It may not be possible for
the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances
the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one
or more specified series of Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture, only the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding relevant series of Senior Secured Notes (and not the consent
of the holders of the majority of all Senior Secured Notes), as the case may be, shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) of this
paragraph, 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes affected (or alternatively,
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes held by such Holder only, the consent of an affected Holder) (provided,
_however that if any amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one or_
more specified series of Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture, only the consent of the holders of at
least 90% (or, in the case of clause (8) of this paragraph, 75%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding relevant series of Senior Secured Notes will be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the time at
which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional
_redemption”;_

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if
any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or
amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption
from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct
Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

221


-----

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, changes to the governing law of the Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes
shall be permitted pursuant to the first sentence of the first paragraph of this section entitled “Amendment and
_waivers.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material
respect under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer) for the
issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for a Notes Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Additional Guarantees,” to
add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of
the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of
any Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment
in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of
the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to
any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility, in
any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect
on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required
to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied
with;

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreement”; or

(11) to provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior
Secured Notes (provided that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are issued in registered form for
purposes of 163(f) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code).

222


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by subsections (3) and (6) of the preceding paragraph in respect of providing for a Notes Guarantee, it
shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture or Notes Guarantee of such additional Guarantor to be
duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any
Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will
not be rendered invalid by such tender.

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issue will
be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and
obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_covenants—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of control” and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant
Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision (other than in respect of the Issuer) and the
security default provision described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Secured
Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment
of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other
than with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor), (6), (7) or_
(8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash_
in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as
the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an opinion of tax counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the
relevant Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax

223


-----

purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such opinion of tax
counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling received from, or published by, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law occurring after the Issue
Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the
Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior
Secured Notes, and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and
thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or
(b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due
and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for
this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as
applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not
previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date
of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Indenture and all sums payable to the Trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under
the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with,
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to_
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (5)).

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the
SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and certain agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set
forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of
the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person

224


-----

would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any Agent becomes the Holder, beneficial
owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not the
Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such Agent.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the
Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or
expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Each such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be deemed to have been given on the later date of its publication and the seventh day
after being so mailed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its
sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above,
it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the
Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed six years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency indemnity and calculation of euro-denominated restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors,
if any, under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer,
any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from
the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the
extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that
other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that
date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Senior Secured Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss
sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify
the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the
Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give

225


-----

rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of
a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in
full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any
sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for
permission to be granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be
no assurance that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be
approved or that permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the
Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to jurisdiction and service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of
the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide that the Issuer, the Sponsor SPVs and each
Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state
court located in the City of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, changes to this “Consent to Jurisdiction and
_Service” paragraph may be effected pursuant to the first sentence of the paragraph entitled “—Amendments and_
_waivers.”_

**Governing law**

The Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt,
changes to this “Governing law” paragraph may be effected pursuant to the first sentence of the paragraph
entitled “—Amendments and waivers.”

**Certain definitions**

“Acquired Indebtedness” means Indebtedness (1) of a Person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at the time
such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or (2) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from
such Person, in each case whether or not Incurred by such Person in connection with such Person becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or such acquisition or (3) of a Person at the time such Person merges with or
into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. Acquired Indebtedness
shall be deemed to have been Incurred, with respect to clause (1) of the preceding sentence, on the date such
Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and, with respect to clause (2) of the preceding sentence, on the date of
consummation of such acquisition of assets and, with respect to clause (3) of the preceding sentence, on the date

recent fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which internal consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer are available, in each case calculated with such pro forma and other adjustments as are
consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on
the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant set forth under

(x) Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA
for the period of the four most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which
internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available. In the event that the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise
discharges any Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the
calculation of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”), then the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in
good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer) to such Incurrence, assumption,
guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the

234

proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter reference period
and may give effect to cost savings or cost reduction synergies that have occurred; provided, however, that the
pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to
the provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness Incurred clause (5)(II) of the second paragraph of the_
covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (ii) the discharge on the
Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred
pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Certain
_covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than Indebtedness Incurred under clause (5)(II) of the second_
paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”).

related financing transactions and including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are
Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or
prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on or substantially concurrently with the
Calculation Date or with all or a portion of the proceeds of any Indebtedness Incurred on the
Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible
accounting or financial officer of the Issuer) as if they had occurred on the first day of the reference
period;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date,
will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period
(taking into account anticipated cost reduction synergies resulting from any such disposal, as
determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer responsible for
accounting or financial reporting);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been
a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any
Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of
the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS;
and

(7) the difference between: (i) the total pro forma consolidated amount received or receivable pursuant to
CICE for the four-quarter reference period as determined on the basis of CICE applicable to all
relevant entities of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as at the end of the period, and (ii) the total
amount received or receivable pursuant to CICE already included in Consolidated EBITDA for that
period, shall be added to Consolidated EBITDA.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as determined in
good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (including in respect of anticipated
expense and cost reductions and synergies as though the full effect of such expense and cost reductions and

235

synergies were realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated
full run-rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer
of the Issuer) of cost savings programs, business optimization programs, centralized purchasing programs or
other restructurings or reorganizations that have been initiated by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
as though programs, restructurings or reorganizations had been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant
reference period (regardless of whether these cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost
synergies could then be reflected in pro forma financial statements to the extent prepared); provided that such
anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies and cost savings are reasonably anticipated to be realized
within 24 months after the consummation of the cost savings program, business optimization program,
centralized purchasing program, restructuring, reorganizations or any operational change or the purchase or sale
or other event which is expected to result in such anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies and cost
savings) and (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of determination and Fixed
Charges for the relevant period, pro forma effect shall be given to any Incurrence, repayment, repurchase,
defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of Indebtedness as if such transaction had occurred on
the first day of the relevant period.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent permitted under “—Financial calculations for Limited Condition
_Transactions,” the Consolidated EBITDA and all outstanding Indebtedness of any company or business to be_
acquired pursuant to a signed purchase agreement (which may be subject to one or more conditions precedent)

Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (the “Rule
144A Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes
will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of
Euroclear, and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”) under the U.S.
Securities Act will be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common
Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable
transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States
or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your
ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their
interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or its respective agents and neither the Paying Agent, the
Registrar, nor the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to
the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes
if:

   - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the
Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor;

   - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

   - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current
procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners
of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable

259


-----

(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer
Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered
Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in
respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as
applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1 in excess thereof will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and
delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable
in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or its appointed
agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met.
We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an
indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Definitive
Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, we in
our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer
Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary
will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the
Common Depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable
Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial
redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption
of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less
than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will in turn make such
payments to the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such

260


-----

payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. We will make payments of all such
amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments
or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required
to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes,”
we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the
Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts
that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest,
as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book- Entry Interests held through such
participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying
Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective
nominees)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book- Entry Interest;

   - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant; or

   - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Notes will be paid to holders of
interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither we nor the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any
holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or
resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect
of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or
have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves the right
to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered
Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may
change from time to time. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any
reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge
such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture.

261


-----

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed in
“Transfer restrictions.”

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of
the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer restrictions.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule
144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor or a written certification (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is
a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes
only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and exchange” and, if required, only
if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See
“Transfer restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly,
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Application will be made to the Authority to list the Notes represented by the Global Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any of our or their
respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system**

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the
Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable or will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.

262


-----

Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who
wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular
day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if
Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**Clearing information**

We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream.
The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes are set forth under “Listing
_and general information—Clearing information.”_

**_Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any of our or their respective agents take any responsibility
for these operations and procedures and we urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to
discuss these matters.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in
several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account
holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take action in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. We understand that, under existing
industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if
an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under
the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest
to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action
or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive
form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners
of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

263

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain French tax considerations**

Except where specifically stated below, the following is a summary of certain material French tax
considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes by a holder of the Notes who (i) is
not a French resident for French tax purposes (ii) does not hold the Notes in connection with a business or
profession conducted in France, or a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in France and (iii) who is
neither a shareholder of the Issuers nor a related party of the Issuers within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of the
French Tax Code.

This summary is based on the French tax laws and regulations, as currently in effect and applied by the
French tax authorities, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different
interpretations.

This summary is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all
of the French tax considerations that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular circumstances.
Furthermore, this summary does not address any French estate or gift tax considerations.

Prospective investors in the Notes are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors as to the French
tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Notes in light of their particular circumstances.

In addition, Article 1649 AC of the French Tax Code imposes on financial institutions within the meaning
of Article 1 of Decree n°2016-1683 to review and collect information on their clients and investors, in order to
identify their tax residence, as well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign tax authorities
(via the French tax authorities) on an annual basis.

**_Payments of interest and other revenues with respect to the Notes_**

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by a debtor that is established in France with respect to
a particular debt (including debt in the form of notes such as the Notes) are not subject to the withholding tax set
forth under Article 125 A, III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are made outside France in certain
non-cooperative States or territories (Etats ou territoires non coopératifs) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A
of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”). If such payments are made in a Non-Cooperative State
other than those mentioned in Article 238-0 A, 2 bis-2° of the same code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable
(subject to certain exceptions, certain of which are set forth below and to the more favorable provisions of any
applicable double tax treaty). The 75% withholding tax is applicable irrespective of the noteholder’s tax
residence or registered headquarters. The list of Non-Cooperative States is, in principle, updated each year. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our business—The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list
_of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where we operate may_
_impact our financial results.”_

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest on debt and other assimilated
revenues paid by a debtor or an issuer of notes that is established in France may not be deductible from the
debtor’s or the issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a
Non-Cooperative State or paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located in such a
Non-Cooperative State within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code. Under certain conditions,
any such non-deductible interest and other assimilated revenues may be recharacterized as deemed dividends
pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case it may be subject to the withholding tax set
out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at a rate of (i) 75% if they are paid on an account opened in a
financial institution located in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in Article 238-0 A, 2 bis-2°
of the same code, (ii) 28% if they are paid to non-French tax resident corporate or other legal entities (it being
noted that according to the French Finance Law for 2020 such withholding tax rate shall vary in line with the
reduction of the common rate of French corporate income tax provided for by Article 219 I of the French tax
Code for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2020) or (iii) 12.8% in cases where the holder is a non-French
tax resident individual, in each case subject to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax provided by Article 125 A, III of the
French Tax Code nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate to genuine
transactions and is not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the non-deductibility set out under Article 238 A
of the French Tax Code and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code
which may be levied as a consequence of such non-deductibility, will apply in respect of a particular issue of

264


-----

debt instruments (including debt in the form of notes such as the Notes) provided that the debtor or the issuer can
prove that the main purpose and effect of such issuance is not to enable payments of interest or other assimilated
revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

Pursuant to French administrative guidelines in the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts
referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211 no 550 and 990 (the “Administrative Guidelines”), an issue of notes
benefits from the Exception without the issuer having to provide any evidence supporting the main purpose and
effect of such issuance of notes, and accordingly will be able to automatically benefit from the Exception (the
“Safe Harbor”), if such notes are:

   - offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State that is not a Non-Cooperative State. For
this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer
document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or

   - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system,
provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and the operation of
such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other
similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or
entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

   - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities settlement
system manager within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or
of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or operator is
not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Notes qualify as debt securities under French commercial law. Considering that (i) as of the date of
their admission to trading, the Notes will be admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange, which is a
regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and that such
market is operated by a market operator that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and/or (ii) at the time of
their issue, the Notes will be admitted to the clearing operations of Euroclear and Clearstream, both securities
settlement systems managers within the meaning of Article L. 561 2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code
which are not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments of interest and other revenue in respect of the Notes
made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will fall under the Safe Harbor.

Accordingly, payments of interest and other assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will be exempt
from the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A, III of the French Tax Code. Moreover, under the same
conditions and to the extent that the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relating to genuine
transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, they will be subject neither to the
non-deductibility set forth under Article 238 A nor to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis, 2 of the
French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located
in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in such a Non-Cooperative
State.

**_Withholding tax applicable to French tax resident individuals_**

Pursuant to Article 125 A of the French Tax Code (i.e., where the paying agent (établissement payeur) is
located in France), subject to certain exceptions, interest received by French tax resident individuals is subject to
a 12.8% levy withheld at source, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the
year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are
also levied at source at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on interest paid to French tax resident individuals. Holders of
Notes who are French tax resident individuals are urged to consult their usual tax advisor where the paying agent
is not located in France.

**_Taxation on disposal_**

Pursuant to Article 244 bis C of the French Tax Code, a Noteholder who is not a resident of France for
French tax purposes and who does not hold the Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed
place of business in France should not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the
gains realized on the sale, exchange or disposal of the Notes.

265


-----

**_Transfer tax_**

No transfer taxes or similar duties are payable in France in connection with the transfer (sale, disposal, or
redemption) of Notes, provided that such transfers are not recorded in a deed registered with the French tax
authorities and that the FTT does not become applicable and except in the case of filing with the French tax
authorities on a voluntary basis.

**Certain general tax considerations—payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject
to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.

**Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This summary
is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for the discussion under “
_—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than_
U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This
summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), by a U.S. holder who
acquires Notes upon original issuance at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the
Notes of a series is sold to investors for cash, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created
or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election
in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a
U.S. person.

This summary is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including provisions of the Code, the
Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of
which are subject to change at any time. Changes in such rules, or new interpretations thereof, may have
retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. We
have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the
conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree
with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of
litigation. A different tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes from those discussed
below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment
in the Notes.

This summary is general in nature and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation or all
tax considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances. In addition, it
does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:

   - tax consequences to holders of the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes;

   - tax consequences to holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to
use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions,
individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities and investors in such
entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

266


-----

   - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or
conversion transaction, or a straddle;

   - tax consequences to a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

   - tax consequences to U.S. expatriates or expatriated entities;

   - tax consequences to persons who are not U.S. holders;

   - persons who are resident in France or any other jurisdiction other than the United States or who have a
taxable presence therein;

   - persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or value);

   - alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences of the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment
income or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax consequences under Section 59A of the Code;

   - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes
being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (within the meaning of Section 451 of
the Code); or

   - any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership considering an investment in the Notes, or a partner in
such a partnership, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The following discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is for informational purposes
only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. If you are considering the purchase of the Notes,
you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under any
other tax laws, under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.

This summary assumes that the Notes will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Pushdown (as described under “Description of the
_Notes—IPO Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt_
Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things the Issuer (and all related provisions) will
now refer to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding company of
the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the indenture governing the Notes. Such a
modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed
exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange
could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners
of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a
deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the New
Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair market value of such Note or such New Note at the time
of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, such Note or such New Note were considered “publicly traded” for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, a U.S. holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the IPO Pushdown generally
will commence on the day after the IPO Pushdown, and tax basis in such New Note would generally equal the
issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed exchange will be
taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of a Note.” If the issue
price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at maturity by more than a de minimis amount,
such New Note will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In such event, U.S. holders would be required to include that original issue discount in their income as
it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. holders should consult their own
tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection
with the IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and
resulting OID, if any.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on
the Notes (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes”) or make additional
payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (as
described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control”). Although the issue is not free
from doubt, we intend to treat the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments
in redemption of the Notes, as not resulting in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments
under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the
date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or
incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. holder,
unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. holder
acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the
IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on
its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the
yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and
conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or
other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. holder
should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Notes (including any non-U.S. taxes withheld from payments thereof and any additional
amounts paid in respect of such withholding taxes) generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income
at the time it is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. holder that receives an interest payment in foreign
currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of
receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest
payment denominated in foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the
amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual
period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period
within the taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis
of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year).
Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual
period, an electing accrual basis U.S. holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by
the U.S. holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable
to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, an
accrual basis U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of
receipt) in respect of an accrual period and the amount previously accrued during such accrual period (as
described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss
generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes will be treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the issue
price of the Notes is less than their stated principal amount by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily

268


-----

defined de minimis amount (1/4 of 1 percent of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the number of
complete years to maturity from their original issue date).

If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on a Note, a U.S. holder (whether a
cash or accrual method taxpayer) will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it
accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this
income. The amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily
portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. holder holds the
Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” (other than the
initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual
period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will equal (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the
Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determined on the basis of
compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less
(b) the stated interest on the Notes allocable to the accrual period. The “yield to maturity” is the discount rate
that, when applied to all payments under a Note as of its issue date, results in a present value equal to the Note’s
issue price. The amount of OID allocable to any initial short accrual period generally may be computed under
any reasonable method. The amount of OID allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the
stated principal amount of the Note and the adjusted issue price of the Note at the beginning of the final accrual
period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note as of the beginning of any accrual period generally will equal its
issue price, increased by previously accrued OID. Under these rules, a U.S. holder of a Note generally will be
required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. A U.S. holder
may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on any Note as OID and calculate the
amount includible in gross income under the method described above. The election must be made for the taxable
year in which the U.S. holder acquires the Note and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S.
holders should consult their own tax advisors about this election. A U.S. holder of Notes must (i) determine OID
allocable to each accrual period in euro using the constant yield method described above, and (ii) translate the
amount into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above under “—
_Payments of Interest.”._

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when an amount attributable to accrued
OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable
to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and
the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all
receipts on an Additional Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued
OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as
receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as
U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

A U.S. holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes, if any, imposed on interest and accrued OID
(including additional amounts), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit taxes
applies to all of such U.S. holder’s other applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest and accrued
OID on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive
category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax
laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for
foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax
credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. holder’s
particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility
of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes_**

If a U.S. holder sells or exchanges a Note, or if a Note that a U.S. holder holds is retired, such holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount such holder realizes on the
transaction (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest that such holder has not previously
included in income, which amount will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in

269


-----

income) and such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. holder will
generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of
purchase increased by any previously accrued OID. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be
based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the
case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if
it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by
translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election
available to accrual basis U.S. holders with regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes traded on an
established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special
election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the
sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss that a
U.S. holder recognizes on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S.-source capital gain or
loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such holder has held the Note for more than one year
on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals)
generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note
generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss, respectively, and generally will be treated as ordinary
income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a
Note is the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will equal the difference, if
any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date
the U.S. holder disposes of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined
at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may realize exchange gain or loss
attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest, and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated
as discussed under “ —Interest.” or “ —Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will realize any foreign
currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued interest) only to the
extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

**_Disposition of foreign currency_**

Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, redemption or retirement of a
Note will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received or at the
time such proceeds from disposition are received. The amount of gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on
the sale or other disposition of such foreign currency for U.S. dollars will be equal to the difference between
(1) the amount of U.S. dollars and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency. Upon any
subsequent exchange of such foreign currency for property, a U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange
gain or loss equal to the difference between (1) the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency paid for such
property based on the spot rate of exchange for such foreign currency on the date of the exchange and (2) the
U.S. holder’s tax basis in the foreign currency so exchanged. As discussed above, if the Notes are traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (or an electing accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine
the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of
exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition. A U.S. holder that purchases a Note with
previously owned foreign currency will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference,
if any, between such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency and the U.S. dollar fair market
value of such note on the date of purchase. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale or other disposition of
foreign currency (including their use to purchase Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) generally will be
U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax shelter
transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency

270


-----

transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an
individual or a trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to
an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

Certain U.S. holders who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value exceeding certain
threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax
returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting
requirements, unless the Notes are held in a financial account at certain financial institutions.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for noncompliance

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated interest on the
Notes, the accrual of OID, and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient (such as a
corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor (which may be us or an
intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments
if: (i) the U.S. holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption
from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the
U.S. holder is incorrect; (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the
Code; or (iv) the U.S. holder has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer
identification number, that it is a U.S. person, and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. holder that it is subject
to backup withholding under the Code.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A U.S. holder may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the
IRS and furnishing any required information.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax on interest
income (including accrued OID) paid on a debt obligation if such interest income is treated as a “foreign passthru
payment” attributable to certain U.S. source payments. However, under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations
issued in December 2018 (and upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued), such
withholding does not apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two years after
the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued.
Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final
Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued generally would be “grandfathered” unless
such obligations are materially modified more than six months after such date. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated
as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period.
Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements
with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. holders
should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event
any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no
additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain Luxembourg tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain material Luxembourg tax consequences of purchasing, owning and
disposing of the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all possible tax situations that may be
relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. It is included herein solely for preliminary
information purposes. It is not intended to be, nor should it construed to be, legal or tax advice. This summary
does not allow any conclusion to be drawn with respect to issues not specifically addressed. The following

description of Luxembourg tax law is based on the Luxembourg law and regulations as in effect and as
interpreted by the Luxembourg tax authorities on the date of this Offering Memorandum. These laws and
interpretations are subject to change that may occur after such date, even with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax
consequences of subscribing, purchasing, holding and disposing the Notes, including the application and effect of
any federal, state or local taxes under the tax laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and each country of which
they are residents or citizens.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy impost or other
charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that
a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités),
municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi)
and personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu des personnes physiques). A corporate taxpayer may further be
subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune), as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax,
municipal business tax, as well as the solidarity surcharge, invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident of
Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and to the solidarity
surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Luxembourg taxation of non-resident holders_**

Holders of the Notes will not be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on business in Luxembourg
solely by reason of the holding, execution, performance, delivery, exchange and/or enforcement of the Notes.

Subject to FATCA described above, under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, there is no
withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to non-resident holders of Notes, or on
accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon
redemption or repurchase of the Notes held by non-resident holders of Notes.

Non-resident holders of Notes not having a permanent establishment or a permanent representative with
whom the holding of the Notes are connected are not subject to any other taxation in relation with the Notes.

Non-resident holders of Notes having a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in
Luxembourg with whom the holding of the Notes are connected are liable to pay Luxembourg income tax on any
interest received or accrued, as well as any reimbursement premium received at maturity and any capital gain
realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes and must include this income in their
taxable income for Luxembourg tax assessment purposes.

**_Luxembourg taxation of Luxembourg resident holders_**

_Luxembourg resident individuals_

Subject to the discussion of FATCA contained herein, under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in
force, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident
corporate holder of Notes by the Issuer or the Guarantors.

Under the law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the “Relibi Law”), payments of interest or similar
income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for the benefit of an individual
beneficial holder who is resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Responsibility for
the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments of interest under the
Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law would be subject to withholding tax of 20%.

An individual holder of Notes may also opt for the application of a 20% tax in full discharge of income tax
in accordance with the Relibi Law, which applies if a payment of interest on the Notes has been made or ascribed
by a paying agent established in an EU Member State (other than Luxembourg), or in a member state of the
European Economic Area (other than an EU Member State). The option for this levy must cover all interest
payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial owner during the entire civil year.
The Luxembourg resident individual who is the beneficial owner of interest is responsible for the declaration and
the payment of such final levy.

An individual Luxembourg holder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is
subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under
the Notes, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the Relibi Law.

272


-----

Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realized upon the sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes by a
Luxembourg holder, who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and who acts in the course of the
management of his/her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal
took place more than six months after the acquisition of the Notes and the Notes do not constitute zero coupon
notes.

An individual Luxembourg holder, who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and
who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes, must further include the portion of the gain corresponding to
accrued but unpaid interest income in respect of the Notes in his/ her taxable income, insofar as the accrued but
unpaid interest is indicated separately in the agreement, except if a final withholding tax or levy has been levied
in accordance with the Relibi Law.

Luxembourg resident individual holders acting in the course of the management of a professional or
business undertaking to which the Notes are attributable, must include any interest received or accrued, as well as
any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in any form whatsoever, in their taxable income for
Luxembourg income tax and municipal business tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the
difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower
of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

_Luxembourg resident companies_

Luxembourg corporate holders must include any payments, on the Notes received from the Issuer or the
Guarantor (except repayments of nominal), as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in
their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax and municipal business tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains
are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including but unpaid interest) and
the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

_Luxembourg resident companies benefiting from a special tax regime_

Luxembourg holders who benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for example, undertakings for
collective investment subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010, specialized investment funds governed
by the amended law of February 13, 2007, family wealth management companies governed by the amended law
of May 11, 2007, or reserved alternative investment fund treated as specialized investment funds for
Luxembourg tax purposes governed by the amended law of July 23, 2016 are exempt from income taxes in
Luxembourg and thus income derived from the Notes as well as gains realized thereon, are not subject to income
taxes.

**_Net wealth tax_**

Luxembourg resident holders and non-resident holders who have a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which or to whom the Notes are attributable, are subject to Luxembourg net
wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder is (i) an individual, (ii) an undertaking for collective investment
subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010, (iii), a securitization company governed by the amended law
of March 22, 2004, (iv) a company governed by the amended law of June 15, 2004, on venture capital vehicles,
(v) a specialized investment fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, (vi) a family wealth
management company governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007, (vii) a professional pension institution
governed by the amended law of July 13, 2005 and (viii) a reserved alternative investment fund vehicle governed
by the amended law of July 23, 2016.

However, (i) a Luxembourg resident securitization company governed by the amended law of March 22,
2004, on securitization, (ii) a professional pension institution governed by the amended law of July 13, 2005, (iii)
a reserved alternative investment fund vehicle (opting for the treatment as a venture capital vehicle) governed by
the amended law of July 23, 2016, and (iv) and a Luxembourg resident company governed by the amended law
of June 15, 2004, on venture capital vehicles shall be subject to the minimum net wealth tax (“MNWT”) charge
according to the amended law of October 16, 1934, on net wealth tax.

The MNWT levied on companies having their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg. For
entities for which the sum of fixed financial assets, transferable securities, such as the Notes, and cash at bank
exceeds 90% of their total gross assets and €350,000, the MNWT is set at €4,815. For all other companies having
their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg which do not fall within the scope of the €4,815
MNWT, the MNWT ranges from €535 to €32,100, depending on the company’s total gross assets.

273


-----

**_Other taxes_**

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in
Luxembourg by the holders as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of these taxes be payable
as a consequence of a subsequent transfer, redemption or repurchase of the Notes (except in the case of voluntary
registration in Luxembourg).

Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual holder is a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax
purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are included in his/her taxable base for inheritance tax purposes.
On the contrary, no estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the Notes upon death of a holder in
cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes at the time of his/her
death. Luxembourg gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of the Notes if the gift is recorded in a deed
executed before a Luxembourg notary or otherwise registered in Luxembourg.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security
interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or the Collateral is being provided. It is a summary
only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions
and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in
multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely
affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the
security interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law
in France.

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Guarantors in France and the security providers in France are incorporated under the laws
of Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the
“EU Insolvency Regulation”), which became fully effective on June 26, 2017 (except with respect to the
obligation of the Member States to establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings that came into on
June 26, 2018, and the obligation of the European Commission to interconnect such registers that will come into
force on June 26, 2019) and applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of the Member
State in which a debtor’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The
determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member
States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the centre of main interests, or “COMI” of a
“debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a
debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to
another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central
administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive
assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other
Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29,
2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in
determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the
debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the
debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but
is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency
proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary
(territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member
State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for
commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations
where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main
insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”

275


-----

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be
secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced
in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot
be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or
(b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor which is domiciled,
habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation
of the establishment or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the
Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main
or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex
_fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_
proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a
Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is there) may
exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove
assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to
the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
debtor has assets.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main
insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and
insolvency practitioners. It also provides for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in
order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming
part of the same group. As from June 26, 2018, the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of
insolvency proceedings and, as from June 26, 2019, the European Commission shall establish a decentralized
system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers.

**France**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of the Issuer
or any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in France, they could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings
affecting creditors, i.e. mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope of the EU
Insolvency Regulation). In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where the EU Insolvency
Regulation does not apply, their main centre of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French
Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France or they have an establishment in France, they could also be subject
to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings, accelerated
safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or
_sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial_
liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or
exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in
turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in turnover, and (ii) commencement of proceedings with
respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency
Regulation or, in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main
center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having
international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific
control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may,
for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all
proceedings in respect of members of the group.

276


-----

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes
and/or the Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests in the Collateral.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France would be
subject to French main insolvency proceedings and any company of our group having an establishment in France
and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary
insolvency proceedings. The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law
for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to
holders of the Notes.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to
holders of the Notes. Such proceedings will likely be amended in the context of the transposition of the
Restructuring Directive into French law with respect to which French statute n° 2019-486 dated 22 May 2019
(“Loi Pacte”) grants the French government twenty-four months to enact appropriate measures through
ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive.

**_Grace periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article
1343-5 of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial
position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment
dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or
rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as
published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment
of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due
during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

**_If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the_**
**_course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted proceedings”_**
**_below)._**

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its due debts with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account available
credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court
ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier
date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date
of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an
agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning
of the hardening period (see below).

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government,
Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020, as modified by Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, modified
the above test and provides that, until 23 August 2020 included, the insolvency test above will be considered in
light of the debtor’s situation on 12 March 2020, absent fraud. As a result of this change, debtors who, absent
these two Ordinances, would have met the insolvency test above between 13 March 2020 and 23 August 2020
are not required (but still have the ability) to file for insolvency proceedings within 45 days, which means that
such debtors would still have access to court-assisted proceedings and safeguard proceedings as described below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, debtors may petition for judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation
proceedings during the period between 13 March 2020 and 23 August 2020 should they meet the insolvency test,
prior to its modification by Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020 as modified.

277

**_Court-assisted proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court- assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders (e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness).

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice,_
mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see
“—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law. They are carried out under the
aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under
the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the
mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or
her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be
negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by
the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending
proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but
those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so for their duration. In any event,
the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French
Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is
not formally approved by it.

Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”) or has not been
insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law. They are carried out under the
aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under
the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur
being able to request a one- month extension). The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating
an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g.
providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be
negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by
the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending
proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but
those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so for their duration and creditors
may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against
the debtor. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor
retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5
of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on
notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may
condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is
acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate
in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the
debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement,
such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the
implementation of the agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of
the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular,
performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to
obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a
judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the
request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works
council or employee representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is insolvent or the conciliation
agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively
ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the

278


-----

rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement
(constatation) as described above, except that in addition:

   - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the
amount of any New Money Lien (as defined herein) and the guarantees and security interests granted to
secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except
vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the
conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office
(greffe) of the Court;

   - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services
designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing
new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all
pre-commencement and post-proceedings claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement
employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent
safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

   - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings,
claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and
their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or
reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders
general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate);

   - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is transmitted to its
statutory auditors; and

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency test”), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as
defined herein—see “—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and
_liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval_
(homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in the case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de
_l’accord) during its execution, and while the agreement is in force:_

   - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

   - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a
grace period in accordance with Article L.611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code and pursuant to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods”), in relation to claims of creditors
(other than public creditors) party to the conciliation proceedings that are not already subject to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliateur
(provided that the terms of his or her appointment included monitoring the implementation of the
agreement, as referred to above); and

   - a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect
to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as
from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of
the court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation
proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual
proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement
are suspended and/or forbidden. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically
put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the
payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to
meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will be a mandatory preliminary step of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the conciliation proceedings have been
consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or

279


-----

total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) which
could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings.
Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad
_hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or_
liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an
ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation
of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end
or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the
commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers
retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being
reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any
specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of
insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed
as from the end of the previous ones.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government,
Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, have modified
conciliation proceedings to provide that:

1. the duration of conciliation proceedings is increased by five months, thereby increasing the maximum
duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of 5 months previously);

2. until 31 December 2020, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request
made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation
proceedings, the debtor may request from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte
proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:

      - the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a
payment default;

      - the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or
immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s
assets that would not have become final; or

      - the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim.

In addition, the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in
accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—France—Grace periods” above) even before
the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline
set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the
conciliation.

**_Court-administered proceedings—safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (en état
_de cessation des paiements) (see “—Insolvency test”). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to_
attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following
the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is
(except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to
investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the
court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the
outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is
also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate
among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of
the debtor assisted by the court- appointed administrator and overseen by the court. The court-appointed
administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto
control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of
the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

280


-----

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_
representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the
safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert such proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) after
commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or
the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) before
commencement of the proceedings, (ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own initiative or upon
request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in the case
where the debtor is insolvent, or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or
the public prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the
bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if
the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end. At any time during the
observation period, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is
insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

(i) the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) above, the court
may act upon its own initiative; and

(ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government,
Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, modified safeguard proceedings to provide that:

   - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization
proceedings, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 provides for a new safeguard or
reorganization privilege (the “S/R Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between
22 May 2020 and the earlier of the date of implementation of EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023
dated 20 June 2019 and 17 July 2021. The S/R Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory
preference enjoyed by financing granted after commencement of the proceedings, with the approval of
the bankruptcy judge, after for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period.

   - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a
share capital increase, by any person:

(a) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its
sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge, or

(b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e. within the plan as approved or
modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment must
mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts.

   - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and
the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings.

   - Such claims may be not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to
the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for
prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or
to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the
safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by
the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

281


-----

_Standard consultation: This applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or_
prepared by a chartered accountant, or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million
or less.

In such a case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court- appointed
creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt
remissions and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is
justified by the difference in the situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’
representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of
claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum possible length of
the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals where the maximum is
fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than
debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it, except when the proposal includes debt for
equity swap. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the
debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were_
submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New
Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the
maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in
which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may
be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5%
of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the
initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the
amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in
accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

_Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, the accounts of which are certified by a_
statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and
with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s
request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’
committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior
to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

   - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in
favor of the debtor, but excluding noteholders (the “credit institutions committee”); and

   - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the
claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the
court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including
capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities
will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of
whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee. Accordingly,
a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee.

282


-----

The proposed plan:

   - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

   - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

   - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring
the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the creditors may subscribe to such share capital increase by
way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where
applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may
also prepare an alternative safeguard plan that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the
bondholders’ general meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same
two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by
the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own
alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period
may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority
vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors’ committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform
the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or
(ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The courtappointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the
creditors’ committees/ bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon
by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the courtappointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In
addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a
payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do
not need to be consulted on the plan or take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval
to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of
creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved
(arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that
required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the
safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who
did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting are consulted in accordance
with the standard consultation process referred to above.

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting
within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they
reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator
for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the
committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within
the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones
applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the
shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving
access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple
majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least
half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to
quorum and majority shall apply.

283


-----

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the bondholders’
general meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the
State prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it
appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would
certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that
are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed
in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or
mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the
framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax
administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. With regard to indirect taxes, relief may only be granted
from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Court-administered proceedings—accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard_**

A debtor that is the subject of conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed
to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those:

   - which publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial
Code; or

   - which publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant
and have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3.0 million (excluding VAT) or
(iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 provides that only the publication of consolidated accounts as
provided for above will be required for proceedings commenced between 22 May 2020 and the earlier of the date
of implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023 dated 20 June 2019 and 17 July 2021, the above
mentioned thresholds will no longer be required.

If the debtor does not exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above), the
court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the
debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

   - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

   - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement
of the proceedings;

   - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a
position to overcome; and

   - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a
going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render
likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial
accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of
three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a month
following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by
an additional month).

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions
committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan

284


-----

through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying to any creditor to
whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any
amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or
(ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor. Such amounts may be
paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors
other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are
not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and
payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committeebased consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde
_accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and_
creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not
bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “committee-based consultation”)),
to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard
proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two
months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions
relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard
or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to vote on the
proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of
accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for
rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their
consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court
shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the
committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 provides that for proceedings commenced
between 22 May 2020 and the earlier of the date of implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023
dated 20 June 2019 and 17 July 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within
the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor
may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened. If
a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall
terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee
process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be
deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as
applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make
such a filing (see below).

**_Court-administered proceedings—judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming
insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have
deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability in the event that judicial
liquidation proceedings should be subsequently commenced against the debtor.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order

285


-----

the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the
debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial
reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings
observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) or the State prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial
reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the
time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having
heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the
workers’ representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation
of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of
share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by
the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months,
and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor with the debtor’s help, or for the sale of the
business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court- appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making
management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management
and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a
manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the
judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to
them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the
debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State
prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order
the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the
outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to
provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “France—Court-administered Proceedings—
_Safeguard”).In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the_
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a
shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if
the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies)
undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the
total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within
the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and (iii) the
modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or
regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then following (x) the
review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or of the State prosecutor and (y) at least three months have elapsed from the court decision
commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of
the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the
insolvency court may either:

   - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share
capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the
reorganization plan; or

   - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or
part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital increase and holding,

286


-----

directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights
(including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s
shareholders’ meetings; the minority shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and
request that their shares be purchased by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of
the reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which
is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in
judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to
represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities
to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order
for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the
debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

(a) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period
of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and
organize such sale of the business as a going concern via an asset sale, i.e. a sale plan (plan de cession),
any third party being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business); or

(b) a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

(i) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

(ii) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude
the sale agreement with the bidder); or

(iii) in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process
whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being
disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility of
implementing such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has
varied.

If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to
the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds
to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due
to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

   - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the
difficulty of selling the assets; or

   - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in
charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits
between the remaining creditors.

**_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months
before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date
earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of

287


-----

conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the
hardening period (période suspecte), which runs from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court
decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void while others are
voidable by the court.

   - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of
other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration,
contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the obligations of the other
party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of matured debts in a manner which
is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for previously incurred
obligations, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the
attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer
of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made by way of security
for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets
or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and
notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to
article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

   - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions
for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures
(saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court
determines that the creditor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions
relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the
six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings.

**_Status of creditors during safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial_**
**_reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of
the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued
operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against
the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract,
diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization
proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909,
which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts
(contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the courtappointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even
though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its contractual
obligations post-filing (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, absent
consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation
proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court
orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business”
(plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration
of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business”
(plan de cession) or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

(a) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment which is deferred for at least one year (however, accrued interest can no
longer be compounded);

(b) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and
payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery
is justified by the continued operation of the business);

288


-----

(c) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings
unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor;

(d) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered or
goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will
be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain
limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed
within one year of the expiration of the observation period;

(e) creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the
debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated
safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the
court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (i) to obtain an
order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require
that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (ii) to
terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (iii) to enforce the creditor’s
rights against any assets of the debtor except (x) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the
applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or
(v) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable—is located in another
EU Member State, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the
insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation;
and

(f) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en
_cours), will be required._

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan
(“plan de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de
_redressement”)._

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors who fall within
the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable
in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales);
this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for
the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to
above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors on whose behalves no claims have been submitted
during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in
connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under
French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’
representative with the list of all of its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the
creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing
of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a
proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They
may also file their own proofs of claim.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of
the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory
auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may
also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as
set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two- or four-months’ time limit). Creditors who did
not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

289


-----

If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation
proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors
according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the
liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees,
post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien
or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social
charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors
whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of
priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right
over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

**_Creditors’ liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held
liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was
wrongful, in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or
guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or
guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be
cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

   - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations that would constitute prohibited financial
assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225 216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of
the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and

   - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from extending credit or guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee
unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient
return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a
real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the
benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors which are subsidiaries of the Issuer and the
amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds
of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness
previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany
loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French
Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of
the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due
by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By
virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Guarantees.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the Guarantee, an economic return that is
less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an
arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length
transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on

290


-----

the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we or the
Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should
be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to
perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock
company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account
(nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges
will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte de
titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to
be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de
_mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests_
that are not publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest
if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of
a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being
paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the
context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure.
If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the
pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and
the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by
the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the
vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition
of companies or groups of companies.

**_Security Agent_**

Ordinance n°2017-748 dated 4 May 2017 clarifies and modernizes the status of the French security agent
(agent des sûretés) by repealing former Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code and by creating a new regime for
the agent specifically designated for the purpose of taking, managing and enforcing security interest and personal
guarantees in the context of financing arrangements. This new regime applies to security agents appointed after
1st October 2017. New Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security
interests and personal guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately
from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees
will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in
cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal
actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a
debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying
its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

**_Parallel debt—trust_**

Under French law—prior to the recent reform of the security agent regime, as described above -, the pledgee
of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be
the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured
claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code.

291


-----

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be
provided for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) that
mirror the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the Notes under or
in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt
and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant
to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an
obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not
directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through
the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the
Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed
by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing
of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French
Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel
Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a
recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that
such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue
addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French
security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on
a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in
France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the
Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important
following Defaults or Events of Default (each as defined therein), and acts as trustee in the interests of the
holders of the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_
n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, inter alia, the Security Agent. To the extent that the
security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement
of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with
the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, action paulienne provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to

292


-----

which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of such debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the
safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or by any of the creditors of such debtor
outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence
of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third
parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case
of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of
the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction
knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such
knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the
security interests in the Collateral or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not
qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests
in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or
declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of
such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the
security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with
respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery
from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances,
holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the
Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for Article L. 626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that, in the context of
safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or continuation plan which is put to the vote of
the creditors’ committees takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements
between creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no
judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of validity of second or lower ranking financial securities account pledges by French courts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower
ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over
the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company
are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests that are not registered, in official
ledgers such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a
company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account
from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking
pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide
that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers
_convenu” (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the_
creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their
appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking
and the second or lower ranking secured parties. This structure has not been tested before the French courts and
no assurance can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there
is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company
are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially
adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event.

293


-----

**_Assumptions as to the enforceability of second ranking bank accounts pledges over the bank accounts_**

Certain pledges over the bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are
available for security interests that are not registered in official ledgers, such as pledges over bank accounts. As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account from granting
a second or lower ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has not been tested before the French
courts and no assurance can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.

**_Grand Duchy of Luxembourg_**

The Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and are in principle
also subject to Luxembourg insolvency law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of
Luxembourg insolvency laws.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as “insolvency
proceedings”) may be commenced against a company with a registered office in Luxembourg having its COMI
in Luxembourg or an establishment in Luxembourg within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation (in
relation to secondary proceedings):

   - insolvency proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of
its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may commence insolvency
proceedings if the Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has
lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are
satisfied, it may open insolvency proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a
creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against
the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and
the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon foreclosure of the assets;

   - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested
by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a provisional suspension of
payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors. A reorganization order
requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the
relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default
and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not
be enforceable during controlled management proceedings; or

   - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be requested
by the company (subject to obtaining the prior consent of the majority of its creditors holding 75% at
least of the claims against such company) and not by its creditors themselves. The court’s decision to
admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by
creditors.

In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected
by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the Issuer into judicial
liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public
prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or
violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as
amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Law”). The management of such liquidation proceedings generally will
follow rules similar to those applicable to insolvency proceedings. Liability of the Issuer in respect of the Notes
will, in the event of a liquidation of such Issuer following insolvency or judicial liquidation proceedings, only
rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts
of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg
law include, among others:

   - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg revenue authorities;

   - value-added taxes and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg customs and excise authorities;

   - social security contributions; and

   - remuneration owed to employees.

294


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is foreclosed upon), and subject to
application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during
the period before insolvency, or the suspect period (période suspecte), which is a maximum of six months from
the date on which the Luxembourg Commercial Court formally adjudicates a person insolvent and, as for specific
payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period
preceding the judgment declaring insolvency, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start
of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the insolvency judgment was preceded by another insolvency
proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law.

In particular:

   - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), specified
transactions (such as the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts that
have not fallen due; whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any
other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by a bill of
exchange; or the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration)
entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null
and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

   - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as
well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court
upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the insolvent party’s cessation of payments;

   - regardless of the suspect period, Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167
of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to challenge any
fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the insolvency; and

   - pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral
arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”), a financial collateral arrangement
entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization
measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against third parties,
administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in
Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves that it was
unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or
that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

In principle, an insolvency order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination
of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its
solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the insolvency order. However, the insolvency
receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the
company. As of the date of adjudication of insolvency, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis
the insolvency estate. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg
company’s business and assets and on the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.

The insolvency receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e.,
contracts existing before the insolvency order). The insolvency receiver may elect to continue the business of the
debtor, provided the insolvency receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not
cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

   - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of an insolvency constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; and

   - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts where the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the insolvency judgment
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contracts.

295


-----

The insolvency receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the insolvent party that are still to be
performed after the insolvency under any agreement validly entered into by the insolvent party prior to the
insolvency. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the insolvency and such claim
will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant
contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

International aspects of Luxembourg insolvency, controlled management or voluntary arrangement with
creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although
there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has
its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation
states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as
where board meetings are held, the location where a company conducts the majority of its business and the
location where the majority of a company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of
the place where a company has its COMI. The time when a company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the
relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the
main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in
such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency
proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one
Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the COMI of a debtor is
in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of
another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings” only in the event
that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such
other Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated
in the territory of such other Member State. If a company does not have an establishment in any other Member
State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such
company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the Issuer’s COMI is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such other jurisdictions may have
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Issuer.

**_Security interests considerations_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei
_sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is_
situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a
consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security
interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg
companies, bank account held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or
having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities that are held through an
account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets
will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with
Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of
pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration,
notification and acceptance requirements. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth the following
enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event:

296


-----

   - the direct appropriation of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation
method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets;

   - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions
_commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public auction;_

   - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following
a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

   - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to
involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security
interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be
enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or
arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under the Luxembourg Collateral Law and the powers of any
receivers or administrators, might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, particularly where
the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the
Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or
assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under
Luxembourg law and such security interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in
another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance with Article 8 of the
EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek
the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges
will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation
of law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by
operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or
unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes, in
particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of
employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (such as
social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This
general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.

**_Financial assistance_**

Any security interests granted by Luxembourg entities, which constitute breach of the provisions on
financial assistance as defined by Article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law or any other similar
provisions, might not be enforceable.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Notes, the Security Documents, the Indenture and the transaction documents (and any
document in connection therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg
is not required. Where the Notes, the Security Documents, the Indenture and the transaction documents (and any
document in connection therewith) are (i) voluntarily presented to the registration formalities or (ii) appended to
a document that requires mandatory registration, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for
instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be
payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of
security interest agreements, which are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral law.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the Notes, the security
documents, the Indenture and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) and any
judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

297


-----

**_Service of process_**

As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters between the United States and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically
recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid judgment against an issuer incorporated
in Luxembourg with respect to the Notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States,
which judgment remains in full force and effect after all appeals that may be taken in the relevant state or federal
jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent
jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur) set forth in
Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile), being:

   - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict
of laws rules;

   - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

   - the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi);

   - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matters under its
applicable rules, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local
law;

   - the judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which the decision has been rendered;

   - the judgment was obtained in compliance with the rights of the defendant, i.e., following proceedings
at which the defendant had the opportunity to appear, was granted the necessary time to prepare its case
and, if it appeared, could present a defense; and

   - the judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the laws of
Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law
and notably if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international public policy. In an action brought in
Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite
power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages.
Furthermore, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have the power to
give judgment expressed as an order to pay in a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment
against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would
be converted into euro.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

**General**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers will enter into a purchase agreement to be dated as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are
offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes
through certain of their affiliates and agents, including in respect of sales into the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S.
Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect
thereof.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set
forth on the cover page hereof. Sales of the Notes may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers or
through registered brokers.

Investment funds or accounts advised or managed by entities affiliated with Bain Capital LLC may purchase
Notes in the Offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this
Offering Memorandum and in the case of investment funds registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement between
the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict the ability of the funds and the affiliates of Bain Capital LLC
to buy or sell the Notes in the future and, as a result, these investment funds and affiliates of Bain Capital LLC
may buy or sell Notes, subject to applicable securities laws, in open market transactions at any time following the
consummation of the Offering.

**_Notes are not being registered_**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any
state securities laws. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule
144A and Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by
broker-dealers who are registered as such under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S.
Exchange Act”). Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations
and agreements described under “Transfer restrictions.” The Initial Purchasers will not offer or sell the Notes
except to persons they reasonably expect to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and sales in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and
will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)
received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the
FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in

299


-----

compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction
where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to this Offering, the
distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the resale of the Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer,
sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by the U.S. Securities Act or the safe
harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**_No sale of similar securities_**

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guarantee by, the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates (other than any securities issued by any funds managed or controlled by Bain
Capital or entities controlled by such funds that have no relationship or connection otherwise with the Issuer, the
Guarantors or their respective subsidiaries or holding companies but are affiliates solely due to the fact that Bain
Capital has an equity interest in such entity) that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the
date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the date of this Offering
Memorandum without prior written consent.

**_New issue of securities_**

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to the Authority to list the Notes
on the on the Official List of the Exchange. No certainty can be given that this application will be granted, and
we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop.

The Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as
permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes,
and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S.
Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be
liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be
favorable to you. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an
_active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

**_Initial settlement_**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the respective Notes on or about the
date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the business day (as such term
is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (such
settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to such trades expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next
succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in T+, to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of
the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisors.

**_Price stabilization and short positions_**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may over-allot the Notes or effect transactions, for a limited period after
the Issue Date, with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might
otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also create syndicate short
positions, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In
addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market
price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to

300


-----

engage in these activities and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the
_Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will_
_be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Any such stabilizing action, if begun, may
be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the Issue Date and 60
calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the
over-the-counter market or otherwise. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There
_may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

**_Other relationships_**

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and original lenders
under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and are or will be counterparties in the hedging arrangements we
expect to roll over and carry forward or enter into in connection with the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers
are lenders under our PGE Loan. The relevant Initial Purchasers and their affiliates receive customary fees and
commissions in such capacities.In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time
have provided in the past and may currently be providing and may provide in the future, investment banking,
commercial lending, consulting and advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business,
for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Also, certain Initial Purchasers
and/or their respective affiliates have various bilateral commitments and exposures to entities in our Group.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments, securities or financial instruments activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours
or our affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our
affiliates routinely hedge their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions
that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities,
including (potentially) the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities
and instruments.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each 144A Note will contain a legend substantially in the following
form:

“THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION
HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION UNLESS SUCH
TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.

THE HOLDER OF THIS NOTE BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF (1) REPRESENTS THAT IT IS A
“QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT), (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR FOR WHICH IT HAS

**ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and certain security providers are
incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Each of the documents relating to the Collateral for the Notes will
be governed by the laws of France or Luxembourg, as applicable. The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and
the Notes are governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law. Some of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since
substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and those of their respective directors and executive
officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or
the Guarantors or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium
(if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S.
federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and
the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction
of New York courts, in each case in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or
under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other
persons mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, the Guarantors or a security provider, investors
will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions in which the relevant company has assets. Even though the
enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the
Issuer, the Guarantors and certain security providers are located, you should consult your own advisors in any
pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**France**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or
principal places of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors, officers and other executives of the
French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore,
most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a
result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to
enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or
state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of
process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad
of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
claims connected with the Notes against French entities and/or French individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a
judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in
France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that
the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

   - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the
choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter;

   - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

   - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions
(i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment

307


-----

should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there
is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and
having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res
judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in
France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities
would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French and European data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing,
data files and individual liberties, as amended and Regulation (EU) 2016/479 of April 27, 2016) can limit under
certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection
with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their
contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public
policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on
the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can
sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French individuals. Pursuant to
Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in
connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French
national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other
than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not
mandatory to the extent that an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient
contact with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive
its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of
conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of December 12, 2012, regarding legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted
to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person
domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the
privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France,
regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the European
Union. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting
one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any
competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents
would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party
from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Luxembourg**

The Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated and established under the laws of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg. All of their assets are located outside the United States. Furthermore, none of their directors or
managers resides in the United States. As a result, investors may find it difficult to effect service of process
within the United States upon the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons or to enforce outside the U.S.
judgments obtained against the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons in U.S. courts, including

308


-----

judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Likewise, it
may also be difficult for an investor to enforce U.S. courts’ judgments obtained against the Luxembourg Security
Providers or these persons in courts located in jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. It may also be difficult for an
investor to bring an original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
U.S. federal securities laws against the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons. Luxembourg law,
furthermore, does not recognize a shareholder’s right to bring a derivative action on behalf of the Issuer.
Furthermore, a contractual provision allowing the service of process against a party to a service agent could be
overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process against a party in
accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party.

The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. According to
Luxembourg case law, a judgment rendered in respect of the Notes by a court of competent jurisdiction in the
State of New York would be recognized and enforced by a Luxembourg court, without reconsideration of the
merits, subject to the following conditions:

   - the judgment of the U.S. court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

   - the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction according to the Luxembourg conflict of jurisdiction rules;

   - the U.S. court must have applied to the matter submitted to it the proper law designated by the
Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (although some first instance decisions rendered in Luxembourg,
which have not been confirmed by the Luxembourg Court of Appeals, no longer apply this condition);

   - the judgment of the U.S. court must not have been obtained fraudulently, and must have been made in
compliance with procedural rules of the country in which it was rendered and, in particular, the rights
of the defendant; and

   - the judgment of the U.S. court must not be contrary to Luxembourg public policy.

The enforcement in Luxembourg of a judgment rendered in respect of the Indenture or the Notes by a court
of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York will be subject to the rules of civil and commercial procedure
as applied by the courts of Luxembourg. The term “enforceable” as used above is subject to all limitations by
reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, controlled management, general settlement with
creditors, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors of the Issuer generally.

Furthermore, a foreign jurisdiction clause does not prevent the parties from initiating legal action in
Luxembourg courts to the extent that summary proceedings (référé) seeking urgent provisional measures are
concerned. Finally, notwithstanding a foreign governing law clause, Luxembourg courts would in principle have
jurisdiction over any urgent provisional measures in connection with assets located in Luxembourg and such
action would most likely be governed by Luxembourg law.

**Statutory auditors’ review report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

To the President,

In our capacity as statutory auditors of Parts Holding Europe and in accordance with your request, we have
performed a review of the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period from
January 1 to March 31, 2020.

We highlight that we have not audited or reviewed the corresponding figures relating to the period from
January 1 to March 31, 2019.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were prepared under your responsibility on
June 29, 2020 on the basis of the information available at that date in the evolving context of the health crisis
related to Covid-19 and the challenges in assessing its impact and future developments. Our role is to express a
conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review.

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the
professional guidance issued by the French institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des
_commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement. A review of interim financial information consists of_
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
IAS 34—standard of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

This report shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with French law. The courts of France shall
have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or difference concerning the engagement letter or this
report, and any matter arising from them. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to object to an
action being brought in any of those courts, to claim that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum or
to claim that those courts do not have jurisdiction.

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

**1 Approval of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

On 29 May 2020, the Chairman approved Parts Holding Europe SAS’s condensed consolidated interim
financial statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2020.

**2 Information relating to the reporting entity**

Parts Holding Europe SAS is a simplified joint-stock company (société par actions simplifiée) domiciled in
France and registered with the Créteil Trade and Companies Registry under number 488 077 165. It was
incorporated on 18 January 2006 under the corporate name Parts Holdings (France) SAS and subsequently
changed its corporate name to “Parts Holding Europe” on 5 November 2018. The address of its registered office
is 22 Avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France.

The Group is a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux and Italy. The Group operates in the independent
aftermarkets of the Western European light vehicle spare parts distribution “core” aftermarket and the truck spare
parts distribution and repair “core” aftermarket in France.

The Parts Holding Europe has a share capital of €68.263.141 as of 31 December 2019. As a result of the
Group’s acquisition on 8 December 2015, Parts Holding Europe and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”)
are deemed subsidiaries of Dakar Acquisition SA, a Luxembourg-based limited liability company
(société anonyme) whose registered office is located at 4, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Luxembourg Findel
(Luxembourg), registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Registry under number B201035 as the
sole shareholder of Parts Holding Europe. Dakar Acquisition SA is a subsidiary of Dakar Topco Sarl., a
Luxembourg-based private limited company (société à responsabilité limitée) and is the ultimate parent company
of the Group, who is in turn a subsidiary of Bain Capital.

**3 Accounting policies and standards**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Parts Holding Europe SAS and its subsidiaries
for the three-month period ended 31 March 2020 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 – Interim
Financial Reporting. The accompanying notes therefore relate to significant events and transactions of the period
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December
2019. The accounting policies applied as of 31 March 2020 are identical to those described in the notes to the
published consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, unless otherwise noted.

The light vehicle and trucks spare parts distribution and repair market in which the Group operates is subject
to seasonal fluctuations. The Group’s results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that
may be achieved for the full financial year. The Group’s quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may
fluctuate in the future, depending upon a variety of factors, including, among other things, shifts in the timing of
holidays, weather conditions, competitive factors and general economic conditions.

Financial data is presented in millions of euros. It is rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise
indicated. In certain cases, rounding may cause non-material discrepancies in the lines and columns showing
totals.

**3.1 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB effective at 31 March 2020**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for the adoption of the following new standards and
amendments:

**Standards** **Effective date**

Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8—Definition of material . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2020

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

Other standards that were newly issued but are not yet effective at 31 March 2020 are not expected to have a
material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**4 Adjustment of AD Bosch Goodwill**

Parts Holding Europe acquired AD Bosch on August 5, 2019. This Spanish distributor was integrated into
the 2019 consolidated financial statements. This lower than one-year period did not allow for a complete
evaluation of AD Bosch group and a provisional goodwill was calculated and recorded in accordance with IFRS
3 “Business combinations”.

During 2020, the calculation of goodwill is still being currently updated, and it retrospectively impacts the
consolidated accounts. As at March 2020, identified adjustments impact inventory valuation for € 1.7 million &
is reflected in December 2019 restated balance sheet.

**5 Scope of consolidation**

**5.1 Acquisitions and disposals in the current period**

No acquisition has been made during the course of the 1[st] quarter 2020.

**5.2 Acquisitions and disposals in the prior period**

For detailed descriptions of all acquisitions and disposals in the prior periods, please refer to the Note 5.1.1
of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2019.

**6 Segment information**

The chief operating decision maker of the Group monitors profitability using revenue and adjusted
EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure which is further defined in the section “Use of adjusted EBITDA” of this note,
for the following operating segments:

   - The Light Vehicles (“LV”) France reportable segment, including headquarter costs attributable to the
LV France segment.

   - The Trucks reportable segment, including headquarters costs attributable to the Trucks segment.

   - The LV International reportable segment, which includes the following entities:

(i) Belgian Doyen Group

(ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies since May 2017 and those
acquired in 2018

(iii) Geevers group since its acquisition in 2018.

   - The Digital BtoC reportable segment created in 2018 includes Oscaro, acquired November 13[th], 2018.

The central purchasing unit (“CPU”) negotiates purchasing conditions for LV France, Trucks and LV
International, which are then sold to wholly owned distributors and to affiliated independent distributors. As part
of the new segmentation, the CPU’s income statement is now broken down between the four segments, primarily
based on the detailed supplier analysis. The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the supplier level and each
supplier is identified as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing truck parts only, providing
LV International parts only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV France, Truck and LV
International parts, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are further split based on the pro-rata value of the mix of
products purchased.

In addition to the four segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose
activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are
directly attributable to one of these segments. Costs that cannot be attributed to one of the segments are presented
in the “Headquarters” column.

**6.3 Use of adjusted EBITDA**

In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, the Group considers a variety of performance and
financial measures. The key measure used for determining how the Group’s business is performing is Adjusted
EBITDA. Management internally assesses the performance and cash flows on a consolidated basis of each
operating segment on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses and adjusted for certain items that the Group believes are non-related to ordinary activities
or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of the business, namely start-up costs related to new
businesses, income and expenses attributable to the implementation of the group transformation plan and the
sponsor fees paid to the shareholders and exceptional one-off expense related to professional conferences.

A reconciliation between Operating income from ordinary activities and Adjusted EBITDA and a
description of the nature of the adjustments are provided below:

Covid-19 identified impacts were assessed as temporary:

_Determination of the recoverable value_

**_LV France_**

At 31 March 2020, the assets tested were valued at €413.1 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use of €647.0 million, calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate of
8.8% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €582.3 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. No
sensitivity test was performed on a perpetual growth rate due to the significant margin given by the impairment
test result. Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was
recognised.

**_Trucks_**

acquisition of Bisensang group in March 2017. At 31 March 2020, the assets tested were valued at €41.2 million.
This amount was compared with their value in use of €41.7 million, calculated based on the present value of
future cash flows using a discount rate of 8.8% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was
performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €37.5 million in the event that objectives in the
business plan were achieved at 90%. No asset impairment was recognised.

**_LV International_**

At 31 March 2020, the assets tested were valued at €391.7 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use of €402.1 million, calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate of
9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €361.9 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. No asset
impairment was recognised.

**_Digital BtoC_**

At 31 March 2020, the assets tested were valued at €130.3 million. This amount was compared with their
value in use of €154.2 million, calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate of
10.4% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the valuation
would amount to €138.8 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%, above the
carrying amount of the net assets tested. No sensitivity test was performed on a perpetual growth rate because of
the significant margin given by the impairment test result. As the value in use is greater than the net book value
of the assets tested, no impairment of assets has been recognized.

Our spare parts distribution and repair activities for light vehicles and trucks were considered by the
government to be essential for the functioning of the country and appear in the list of businesses that can remain
open, by decree of March 15, 2020.

Indeed, our services allow the maintenance of mobility which has been recognized by the government as
essential, even if its exercise is limited. Our platforms and distributors are required to deliver spare parts to the
entire light vehicles and trucks repair sector, including our own network. They are involved in repairing vehicles
potentially used by medical staff or vehicles transporting them. Similarly, workshops can also be required to
repair trucks, essential for supplying stores with foodstuffs, and vehicles of people involved in all activities
which are recognised as essential, to ensure their mobility.

In this period of public transport understandable restriction, a certain number of our fellow citizens - the
medical staff but also the bakeries and supermarkets employees, retirement homes staff, cleaning staff, food
distribution platforms and transport companies employees and many more - must move in compliance with the
rules set by the public authorities. They require spare parts needed to repair their vehicles.

Keep on providing them with our service means contributing, as a responsible and civic company, to the
functioning of the country.

**17 Events after the end of the reporting period (Continued)**

However, even though we wish to contribute to the country’s Economic Continuity Plan, we note a very
significant drop in turnover in some of our entities.

At this stage, these events have a short-term impact on our operations due to the uncertainty about the
duration of the measures implemented and the catch-up effect to be anticipated over the rest of the 2020 financial
year. Furthermore, we do not anticipate any major impact in the medium term, particularly in the time frame of
our strategic plan.

In order to structurally protect the Group and our employees, the following action plan has been taken:

   - partial unemployment measures, depending on local situations.

   - implementation, for each country, of government support, including taxes and social security charges
delays.

   - renewal confidence with our banks.

   - implementation of punctual financing guaranteed by the different countries.

   - daily monitoring of cash disbursements to the most vulnerable of our partners.

In addition, the group has a very good level of cash, enabling it to largely meet its short-term maturities.

The Group therefore remains confident in its ability to overcome the negative impacts of this health crisis
and then resume normal activities as soon as the pandemic is over, without assuming its duration.

Since the end of the lockdown, Group activity gradually recovers in European countries in which the Group
operates. However, protective measures took in March still apply during the whole 1[st] semester to structurally
protect our company.

Strategic middle term plan has not been reassessed as hypothesis are still uncertain but management remains
confident thanks to lower public transportation utilization and increasing car parc age.

Refinancing are currently being negotiated in all countries, Group taking advantage of all governmental
measures to preserve business continuity.

In April 2020, Group has taken over the activity of 2 AD Belux historical customers Autovak & AD
Autoparts. These 2 companies are located in Flanders (Northern Belgium). They had an activity of € 10 million
sales in 2019. They employ c. 50 peoples in 4 shops.

This acquisition strengthens and develops Belux Autodistribution network with the opportunity to deploy its
activities, brands, concepts and programs while contributing to the Group’s overall profitability.

**Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements**

To the sole shareholder of Parts Holding Europe,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your sole shareholder, we have audited the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parts Holding Europe for the year ended December 31, 2019.
These consolidated financial statements were approved by the President, on March 26, 2020, on the basis of the
information available at that date, in the evolving context of the health crisis related to Covid-19.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and
of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019 and of the results of its operations for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

**Audit Framework**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities
_for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

**Independence**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period
from the 1[st] of January 2019 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit
services referred to in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.

**Emphasis of Matter**

We draw attention to the following matter described in Notes 4.2 and 4.3 to the consolidated financial
statements which set out the impacts regarding the first-time application of IFRS 16 “Leases”. Our opinion is not
modified in respect of this matter.

**Justification of Assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code
_de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following assessments that, in_
our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole,
approved in the conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

F-29


-----

Note 3.3 “Significant judgements and estimates” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
outlines the accounting method used by your company in terms of inventory impairment, year-end rebates
received from suppliers, staff expenses and benefits, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and deferred
tax assets, and the methods that involve estimates.

We appreciated the reasonableness of the estimates. We also verified that this note to the consolidated
financial statement provides the appropriate information.

At each closing, the group conducts an impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite
life, and also assesses whether there is any indication of impairment of the long-term assets value, as described in
notes 9.1 and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements. We reviewed how this impairment test was
implemented, the data and assumptions used, and the calculations performed by your group. We also checked
that notes 3.3, 9.1 and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements provide appropriate information.

**Specific verifications**

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific
verifications required by laws and regulations of Group’s management report of the President as approved on
March 26, 2020. With regard to the events that occurred and the facts known after the date the consolidated
financial statements were approved by the President relating to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, the
management indicated to us that they will be communicated to the sole shareholder called to approve the
financial statements.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial
statements.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the President.

**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit
does not include assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the
company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory
auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence
considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
internal control.

Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements.

Assesses the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company
to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there
is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor
is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements
and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1 Preparation and approval of the consolidated financial statements**

On 26 March 2020, the Chairman approved Parts Holding Europe SAS’s consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2019.

**2 Information relating to the reporting entity**

Parts Holding Europe SAS is a simplified joint-stock company (société par actions simplifiée) domiciled in
France and registered with the Créteil Trade and Companies Registry under number 488 077 165. It was
incorporated on 18 January 2006 under the corporate name Parts Holdings (France) SAS and subsequently
changed its corporate name to “Parts Holding Europe” on 5 November 2018. The address of its registered office
is 22 Avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France.

The Group is a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux and Italy. The Group operates in the independent
aftermarkets of the Western European light vehicle spare parts distribution “core” aftermarket and the truck spare
parts distribution and repair “core” aftermarket in France.

The Parts Holding Europe has a share capital of €68.263.141 as of December 31[st], 2019. As a result of the
Group’s acquisition on 8 December 2015, Parts Holding Europe and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”)
are deemed subsidiaries of Dakar Acquisition SA, a Luxembourg-based limited liability company
(société anonyme) whose registered office is located at 4, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Luxembourg Findel

sole shareholder of Parts Holding Europe. Dakar Acquisition SA is a subsidiary of Dakar Topco Sarl., a
Luxembourg-based private limited company (société a responsabilité limitée) and is the ultimate parent company
of the Group, who is in turn a subsidiary of Bain Capital.

**3 Accounting policies and standards**

The consolidated financial statements of Parts Holding Europe SAS and its subsidiaries have been prepared
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), as adopted by the European Union as of 31 December 2019 and available
on the following website: http://ec.europa.eu/finance/company-reporting/ifrs-financial-statements/index_fr.htm

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, except for
certain categories of assets and liabilities as indicated, in accordance with IFRS principles.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest
million unless otherwise stated.

**3.1 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB effective at 31 December 2019**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, with the exception of the adoption of the following new
standards and amendments:

**Standards** **Effective date**

IFRS 16—Leases (Impact estimation on debt done in 2018) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019
IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (IAS12) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019
Amendment to IFRS 9—Implementation and disclosures under IFRS 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019
Annual improvements to IFRS (2015—2017 cycle) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 December 2017

The balance sheet impacts of the application of these new standards are detailed in note 4.

**3.2 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB whose application is not mandatory at**
**31 December 2019**

The Group has not elected to early adopt the following new and revised standards published by the IASB
but whose application is not yet mandatory. Other standards that were newly issued but are not yet effective at
31 December 2019 are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
The process of determining the potential impact of these texts on PHE’s consolidated financial statements is
underway and without significant impact.

**3.3 Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain significant
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies.

Estimates are made based on a going concern assumption and on information available at the date of their
preparation. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations about future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. When the Group makes estimates and assumptions
concerning the future, the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual
results.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates
are significant to the consolidated financial statements are:

   - Inventory impairment—Note 7.3

   - End-of-year supplier rebates—Note 7.6

   - Employee costs and benefits—Note 8

   - Impairment of non-financial assets—Note 9.1 and 9.2

   - Deferred tax assets—Notes 13.2

**4 Change in accounting methods, adjustment of Oscaro goodwill and application of IFRS 16 and IFRIC 23**

**4.1 Adjustment of Oscaro goodwill**

Parts Holding Europe acquired Oscaro group on November 13, 2018. This group was integrated into the
2018 consolidated financial statements. This period of one and a half months did not allow for a complete
evaluation of Oscaro group and a provisional goodwill was calculated and recorded in accordance with IFRS 3
“Business combinations”.

During 2019, the calculation of goodwill was updated and it retrospectively impacts the consolidated
accounts. The calculation of goodwill is detailed in point 5.1.2.3 and the impact of the adjustments in 4.1.3.

**4.2 Impact of the standard application**

Š IFRS 16

In January 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 16 ‘Leasing’, replacing IAS 17,
which represents the first major overhaul in lease accounting for over 30 years. These changes become effective
from 1 January 2019.

IFRS 16 has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and high value
equipment—requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognising a ‘right-of-use’ asset representing its
right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. In
the income statement, this standard application results in a amortisation and interest expenses recognition.

The group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, without cumulative effects in
equity as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the current period. Prior periods have not
been restated.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

Š IFRS 16 (Continued)

The table below reconciles the amount of off-balance sheet commitments as of December 31, 2018 with the

**Additional liability for IFRS 16 application as of January 1, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **183.9**

Main assumptions and exemptions:

The selected duration of the lease term is the minimum contractual increased by potential renewals, if the
lessee is reasonably certain to exercise them. This criteria is used for the discount rate choice.

Average discount rates used in 2019:

**Duration of the lease term** **3 years** **6 years** **9 years** **12 years**

Belgium . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.65% 2.75% 3.75% 5.25%

No changes for leases with a lease term of less than 12 months and a value below 5 000 dollars which are
accounted for the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.

For those leases previously classified as finance leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are
measured at the date of initial application at the same amounts as under IAS 17 immediately before the date of
initial application.

Š IFRIC 23

Group determined whether its tax treatments should be considered as uncertain according to IFRIC 23
application. Impacts as at Dec 18 is estimated to be €0.8M of additional deferred tax liabilities.

**4.3 Impact on the consolidated statement of financial position**

Adjustments in the calculation of Oscaro goodwill have a retroactive effect on the accounts. They are
therefore recognized in an adjusted balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.

IFRS 16 and IFRIC 23 have been applied without restatement of comparative information. Reclassifications
and adjustments resulting from the standard application are not taken into account in the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2018 but are recognized in the opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.

The following Balance Sheet shows the adjustments recorded for each line item.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**5 Scope of consolidation**

_Consolidation_

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holding Europe SAS and its
controlled entities. Control is assessed as having (i) the power over the investee through voting rights or similar
rights, (ii) exposure to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and (iii) the ability to use power over
the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. Controlled entities are consolidated from the date the
Group obtains control until such time the Group ceases to exercise control.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealized income, expenses, gains and losses that are
included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal transactions are eliminated.

In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in an entity already controlled by the Group, the
difference between the acquisition price of the shares and the additional interest acquired by the Group in
consolidated equity is recorded in stockholders’ equity. The value of the entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities
(including goodwill) for consolidation purposes remains unchanged.

Entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not have control, are accounted for using
the equity method. The investments in such entities are initially recognized at cost, including the goodwill of the
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss, and is subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the
profit or loss in the investee. In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in entities that were previously
accounted for using the equity method that results in the Group obtaining control, the previously held equity
interest is remeasured at fair value and the difference between the fair value and carrying value is recorded as a
gain or loss in the income statement.

When the parent company loses control of a previously consolidated entity, assets and liabilities related to
such entity is derecognized including any goodwill and a gain or loss associated with the loss of control of the
former entity is recognized.

**5.1 Acquisitions and disposals**

Business combinations are recorded in accordance with IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. The
acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS accounting criteria are
recorded at acquisition-date fair value, including any previously held interest but with the exception of
non-current assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets
and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards. The costs directly
attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in which they are incurred.

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where appropriate,
non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s identifiable assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note 9.1 for impairment of goodwill.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities related to acquisitions recorded on a provisional basis are
recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a maximum 12 months of the acquisition
date. After the end of the allocation period, the effects are recorded directly in the income statement unless they
correspond to corrections of errors.

IFRS 10 on Consolidated Financial Statements presents a single consolidation model and provides a
definition of control that includes:

Power over the entity

Exposure, or right, to variable returns of the entity,

The ability to use its power to impact the amount of its returns

Basically a shareholder has control over the entity when it owns more than 50% of the voting rights. IFRS
10 states that an investor may control an entity with less than 50% of the voting rights and provides specific
guidance for assessing control in such situations.

In accordance with IFRS 10, in the case where the shareholder has the practical capacity to exercise its
substantive voting rights and in the case where such rights are exercisable; these rights must be taken into
account when calculating the percentage of control.

**6 Segment information**

The reportable segments reflect the segmentation used for internal reporting purposes, which is presented to
the Chief Operating Decision Maker and used for monitoring the operations and the performance of the Group.
Each reportable segment is an operating segment identified in accordance with paragraphs 5-10 of IFRS 8
“Operating Segments”. The chief operating decision maker is responsible for managing resources and assessing
the profitability of each operating segment. The chief operating decision maker of the Group was identified as the
Chairman of the Group in charge of strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker does not review
information regarding the Group’s assets and liabilities.

**6 Segment information (Continued)**

Since the beginning of 2017, the Group’s management has further aligned its internal reporting structure to
its strategic allowing improved monitoring of the Group’s two operating units in France (Light Vehicles and
Trucks) and its international operations in the rest of Western Europe. At the end of 2018, after the acquisition of
Oscaro, the Group added specific monitoring of its digital BtoC activities.

The chief operating decision maker of the Group monitors profitability by revenue and adjusted EBITDA, a
non-GAAP measure which is further defined in the section “Use of adjusted EBITDA” of this note, and by the
following operating segments:

   - The Light Vehicles (“LV”) France reportable segment, including headquarter costs attributable to the
LV France segment.

   - The Trucks reportable segment, including headquarters costs attributable to the Trucks segment.

   - The LV International reportable segment, which includes the following entities:

(i) Belgian Doyen Group

(ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies since May 2017 and those acquired
in 2018

(iii) Geevers group since its acquisition in 2018

(iv) AD Bosch Group in Spain, acquired on 31 July 2019.

   - The Digital BtoC reportable segment created in 2018 includes Oscaro acquired in the current year.

The central purchasing unit (“CPU”) negotiates purchasing conditions for LV France, Trucks and LV
International, which are then sold to wholly owned distributors and to affiliated independent distributors. As part
of the new segmentation, the CPU’s income statement is now broken down between the four segments. This
breakdown is primarily based on the detailed supplier analysis. The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the
supplier level and each supplier was identified as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing
truck parts only, providing LV International parts only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV
France, Truck and LV International parts, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were further split based on the pro-rata
value of the mix of products purchased.

In addition to the four segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose
activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are
directly attributable to one of these segments. Costs that cannot be attributed to one of the segments are presented
in the “Headquarters” column.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is monitored at the level of each segment (see Note 9.1).

**6.3 Use of adjusted EBITDA**

In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, the Group considers a variety of performance and
financial measures. The key measure used for determining how the Group’s business is performing is Adjusted
EBITDA. Management internally assesses the performance and cash flows on a consolidated basis of each
operating segment on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses and adjusted for certain items that the Group believes are non-related to ordinary activities
or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of the business, namely start-up costs related to new
businesses, income and expenses attributable to the implementation of the group transformation plan and the
sponsor fees paid to the shareholders and exceptional one-off expense related to professional conferences.

A reconciliation between Operating income from ordinary activities and Adjusted EBITDA and a
description of the nature of the adjustments are provided below:

**7 Operating performance**

Recurring operating income comprises of revenue, cost of goods sold, personnel costs, external expenses,
taxes other than on income, other operating income and expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. It
also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of services rendered
during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange gains and losses relating to
recurring operating activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**7 Operating performance (Continued)**

Cost of goods for sale includes purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories and net additions
to inventories depreciation.

Other income and expenses from operations relate to unusual and material events. Other income from
operations can include gains on the disposal of operations and on the disposal of property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets. Other expenses from operations can include losses on the disposal of operations and on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as any cost relating to past disposals, the
costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**7.1 Revenue**

Revenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good
or service to the customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset.

Sales revenue

The Group operates a distribution of spare parts for light vehicles and trucks. Revenue is recognized when
control of the products has transferred. Revenue from sales is recognized based on the price specified in the
contract, including variable considerations if any.

A receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is
unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

Direct flow sales commission

The Group also operates sales of spare parts, equipment and tools delivered directly by suppliers to
independent distributors that do not pass through the Group’s logistics platforms. When such third-party
suppliers other than the Group are involved in providing goods to a customer, the Group assesses whether the
nature of its promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods itself or to
arrange for the suppliers to provide those goods or services. The Group is considered an agent if its performance
obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods by the suppliers and revenue is recognized for the amount of
any commission to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the suppliers to provide
their goods. The commission earned is net of consideration that the Group retains after paying the suppliers the
consideration received in exchange for the goods to be provided by that supplier.

The Group has recognized the following amounts relating to revenue in the consolidated income statement

**2019** **2018**

Revenue from contracts with customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,797.4 1,465.8

**7 Operating performance (Continued)**

The Group does not have any material contract assets or liabilities other than receivables from contracts with
customers since all its performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time and there is no significant
financing or special payment terms offered to its customers. Refer to Note 7.4 for changes in receivables during
the years presented.

**7.3 Inventories**

Inventories consist primarily of goods purchased from the third-party suppliers and are typically not further
modified or transformed by the Group. Inventories are valued at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell taking into
account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks related to slow-moving items.

Cost is calculated using the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the reporting period. The cost
of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and allowances, discounts granted by suppliers, as
well as the transportation cost of purchases. Given the fast inventory turnover rate, this method of inventory
costing is deemed to be a good approximation of first-in, first-out valuation methodology.

Significant judgements and estimates

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold products
based on the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

**7.4 Trade receivables**

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such as a
probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group will not be able to
recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is
reduced using an allowance account. The impaired outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed
non-recoverable.

**7 Operating performance (Continued)**

Under all these factoring arrangements, the Group retains late payment and credit risk and therefore, the
Group continues to recognize the transferred receivables in their entirety in its balance sheet. The amount
repayable under the factoring agreement is presented as secured borrowing and is not offset against the
receivables, in accordance with IAS 39. As of 31 December 2019, the Group had a total available credit line of
€44.5 million under these arrangements, of which €13.3 million was drawn down.

In 2017, the Group entered into a new factoring agreement with Factofrance and transferred its receivable
for the amount of €93.0 million as of 31 December 2019 and for €83.8 million as of 31 December 2018. The full
amount of transferred receivables has been derecognized as the Group does no longer retain the risks and rewards
concurrent to the ownership of these receivables.

**8 Employee costs and benefits**

The Group’s employees benefit from the following plans:

   - Defined contribution plans: The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the
return on these investments. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as
an expense.

   - Defined benefit plans: In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement
benefits. These plans are largely unfunded. Actuarial gains and losses from valuation of these plans are
recognized immediately in equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

Significant judgements and estimates

An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under the defined benefit plans annually using
the projected unit credit method. These calculations include demographic actuarial assumptions concerning
mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections. Probable future benefits are discounted
using a discount rate with reference to the yield on investment-grade bonds.

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These valuations are
based on assumptions such as the discount, salary increase, staff turnover and mortality rates. Due to the
long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty around these estimates.

**8.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The salary growth rate has been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
long-term salary growth rate was adjusted for the year ended 31 December 2017 based on a study conducted by
the actuarial firm in October 2017.

For mortality rates, tables TGH 05 and TGF 05 have been used, which take into account both gender and
age factors. The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds, such as the 10-year Euro corporates bonds for AA-grade companies. The valuation assumptions used in
the calculations for the periods presented are as follows

**9.1 Goodwill**

In business combinations, goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and,
where appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s identifiable assets
and liabilities. Goodwill is tested where there are indications of impairment and at least once a year in order to
determine whether the carrying amount is less than the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference.

For the purpose of the impairment test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities of a cashgenerating unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs. A CGU is a homogeneous group of assets whose continued use
generates cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

Significant judgements and estimates

The impairment test consists of measuring the CGU’s recoverable amount and comparing it to its carrying
amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The
value in use of a CGU is determined as the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from said
assets based on the economic conditions and the operating assumptions made by the Group management. An
impairment loss recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed upon an increase in the recoverable amount.

The LV France and HGV segments each represent the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes; each segment is considered a CGU, as the synergies resulting from

F-61

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**


acquisitions in these segments benefit the activities of the entire segment due to the Group’s vertically integrated
distribution model (purchasing, logistics and distribution departments). As indicated in Note 6.3, the Group’s
management uses the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA to monitor the synergies arising from
acquisitions at segment level.

In 2019, the goodwill was allocated and tested following the following segments:



- LV Frances;

- Trucks;



- LV International.



   - Digital BtoC

_Determination of the recoverable value_


**_LV France_**

At 31 December 2019, the assets tested were valued at €479.3 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use of €789.5 million, calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount
rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €710.6 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%.
No sensitivity test was performed on a perpetual growth rate due to the significant margin given by the
impairment test result. Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment
was recognised.

acquisition of Bisensang group in March 2017. At 31 December 2019, the assets tested were valued at
€43.2 million. This amount was compared with their value in use of €45.0 million, calculated based on the
present value of future cash flows using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
test was performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €40.5 million in the event that objectives in
the business plan were achieved at 90%. No asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2019, the assets tested were valued at €329.6 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use of €332.5 million, calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount
rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €299.3 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%,
above the carrying amount of the net assets tested. No sensitivity test was performed on a perpetual growth rate
because of the significant margin given by the impairment test result. As the value in use is greater than the net
book value of the assets tested, no impairment of assets has been recognized.

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

**9.2 Other intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost. Intangible assets acquired in connection
with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Costs relating to intangible assets
created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.

In accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”, development expenses are are capitalized as an intangible
asset when the following criteria are met:

   - the technical feasibility of the project is demonstrated;

   - the intention exists to finish the project and use or sell the products created during the project;

   - the ability to use or sell the products created during the project is demonstrated;

   - a potential market for the products created during the project exists or their usefulness, in case of
internal use, is demonstrated, leading one to believe that the project will generate probable future
economic benefits;

   - adequate resources are available to complete the project; and

   - the expenditure attributable to the project during its development phase can be reliably measured.

Compliant with IAS 38, research expenses, or development expenses that do not meet the criteria set out
above, are recorded as expenses in the year in which they are incurred.

Intangible assets with a finite useful life

Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives for accounting purposes and
are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Amortization of intangible
assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on
the intangible asset’s function. The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise
Movex accounting software licenses, as well as capitalized development costs.

Amortization begins when the asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful life:

Software (licences) 5 years

Capitalized development costs 2 to 5 years

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a
year on 31 December, either individually or at the level of the CGU to which they belong, and whenever there is
an indication that they may be impaired.

Impairment

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated amortization
and impairment. The assets are tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its net carrying
amount, where the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in
use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent on
the cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in
the income statement in the appropriate expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset. An
assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously identified indication of
impairment has decreased or no longer exists. In this case, the Group estimates the recoverable amount and an
impairment loss previously recorded is reversed to the asset’s recoverable amount. When an impairment loss is
reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,
less depreciation and amortization, had no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An
impairment loss reversal is recorded in the income statement.

Significant judgements and estimates

The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a
year at the reporting date. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually
at the reporting date in order to determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment is still justified. If it is
not, the change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

For the purpose of impairment testing, value in use is determined using the projected future cash flows
based on the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee, discounted by applying a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

**9.3 Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures, are carried
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Routine maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following useful
lives:

Properties 25 years
Equipment and machinery 10 years
General fixtures and fittings 5 years
Transportation equipment 5 years
Furnishings 5 years
IT equipment 2 years

The useful lives of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified when necessary on
each annual reporting date.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized when it is disposed of or when no further future
economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from derecognizing an asset (calculated
on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on disposal and the net carrying amount) is recorded in
the income statement in the year in which it is derecognized.

**11 Provisions**

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implied) arising as a result of a
past event, when it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be necessary in
order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. In the ordinary course of
its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating to industrial disputes, commercial
disputes, etc. In such cases, in conjunction with its legal advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the
disputes and assesses the probability that an outflow of resources will be required to settle them.
When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an insurance
policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The amount of the expense
corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of any refunds.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a current rate
before tax, which reflects the risks specific to the liability. When the provision is discounted, the increase relating
to the passage of time is recorded as a financial expense.

**11 Provisions (Continued)**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automotive spare parts in France, sued
Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de Commerce) for the
sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is for approximately €2.4 million. No
provision was booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019. The Commercial
Court handed down a judgment on 23 March 2017 that exonerated Gadest and Autodistribution, and retained the
potential liability of three other subsidiaries, adding that the €0.3 million in compensation is secured by Klarius’
English parent companies in collective proceedings. This judgement is not enforceable. In this context, Group
confirms its historical position and consider that the probability of an outflow of resources has not been
demonstrated, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the lawsuit. An appeal in “cassation” was
formulated on October 11, 2018 by the liquidator of Klarius. The Group is therefore awaiting briefs and a date
for oral argument.

**12 Financial assets and liabilities**

Financial assets

IFRS 9 introduces a classification approach for financial assets, either at amortized cost or at fair value. The
financial asset is classified in its entirety and is not subject to complex rules of decomposition.

Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets should be classified and measured:

   - the business model of the entity for the management of financial assets, and

   - the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial asset.

For a financial asset in the scope of IFRS 9, there are 3 types of economic models:

   - If the objective of the business model is exclusively to hold financial assets to cash out contractual cash
flows: the financial asset is measured at amortized cost.

   - If the objective of the business model is both to hold financial assets to cash out in contractual cash
flows and to sell financial assets: the financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss.

   - If financial assets that are not held in any of the two business models above are measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

The Group’s financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and in the
category of financial assets measured at amortized cost.

Financial liabilities

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are recognized over the term of the
loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortized issue costs are presented as a deduction from the
liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized through the
amortized cost mechanism.

Fair value

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as effective for as of 1 July 2014, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

Level 1: prices on the valuation date for identical instruments to those being valued, quoted on an active
market to which the entity has access;

Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

F-69


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12 Financial assets and liabilities (Continued)**

Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from extrapolations).This
level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is obliged to rely on its own assumptions
to assess the data that other market participants would have applied to price other instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents are measured at level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

**12.6 Financial risk management objectives and policies**

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment of dividends to
shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares. The Group does not have any equity-based
covenants.

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under finance
leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The financial instruments are
contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The Group has other financial assets such as
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, which are generated directly by its
operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange
risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing these risks are summarized below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimize debt to equity ratios and the financial leverage
obtained by debt.

**12.6.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows at fixed and variable rates, and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk on the portion of
debt corresponding to the €443.0 million Senior Secured Notes paying interest at Euribor +4.375% and to the
€175.0 million Senior Secured Notes paying interest at Euribor +5.5%.

An increase in the 3-month Euribor rate would have the following impacts on the interest costs related to the
Senior Secured Notes:

**12 Financial assets and liabilities (Continued)**

**12.6.2 Foreign exchange risk**

Following the disposal of the Poland business, the Group does not have any subsidiaries whose functional
currency is other than euro.

**12.6.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain payment
credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce its credit
default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment history, past or present
financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure relates to
potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure equals the carrying amount of these
instruments.

**12.6.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing through
the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

**12.6.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a good credit
risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise value for shareholders

**13 Income tax**

The Group opted for tax consolidation in France. This option concerns all the Group’s French companies
with the exception of non-material subsidiaries.

_Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are valued at the
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws applied to
determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the
income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution Economique
_Territoriale – CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée_
_des Entreprises – CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods for determining said contribution with regard to_
the provisions adopted by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the
French national accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité – CNC) and it concluded that this
contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been
classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

**13.2 Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences existing at the
reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the statement of
financial position.

Deferred tax liabilities are recorded for any taxable timing differences while deferred tax assets are recorded
for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is
probable that a taxable profit will be available against which they may be offset. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year in which the asset is realized or the
liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules) enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred taxes related to items recognized directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the income
statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and when they
relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority.

Significant judgements and estimates

The calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate
how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of tax
management strategies. Recognized deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s six-year
business plan for the year ended 31 December 2017 and of five-year business plan for the years ended
31 December 2016 and 2015.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it no longer
appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some or all of said deferred tax
assets can be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized if it
becomes likely that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (which allows offset of income from companies
in a previous tax group against losses in the new tax group in which they belong) for companies Parts Europe
(formerly Autodis) consolidates for tax purposes. This tax consolidation group’s tax loss carry-forwards were
offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an expanded base in 2019. There is also a French
tax consolidation group whose parent company is Parts Holding Europe and which includes the companies
acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax base (previously consolidated with Parts Europe for
tax purposes).

In 2019, the fiscal group’s result is—€3.6 million. In 2018, it was nil.

According to French Finance Act of 2013, effective as of 31 December 2012, loss carry-forward is limited
to €1.0 million plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount. Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of
the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the tax loss carry-forwards. The result obtained is then included in the
Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also
applies.

A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the six-year business plan
for France to determine the future utilization of tax loss carry-forwards in light of existing offset rules and to
assess the deferred tax asset to be recognized in the financial statements at 31 December 2019.

This exercise shows that €208.0 million in tax loss carry-forwards would be utilized, i.e., a tax saving of
€57.3 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of the business
plan, the deferred tax asset recognized in the financial statements was limited to this amount.

At 31 December 2019, tax loss carry-forwards, after utilizing €34 million in 2019, stood at €83.8 million for
the expanded base and €287.3 million for the Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group in France.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse in the long
term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2020 budget and the five-year business
plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax assets after the said period, except as a
deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the reporting date. At 31 December 2019, unrecognized
tax loss carry-forwards amounts to €153.0 million.

**16.3 Personal training account**

The personal training account is managed by a third party through Caisse des dépôts et consignations. The
related contributions—amounting to 0.2% of payroll—are paid over to Caisse des dépôts et consignations via
two training organizations (OPCA and OPACIF). All of the Group’s entities are subject to the rules governing
the personal training account.

**17 Transactions with related parties**

**Relationship with the shareholder**

The sole shareholder of Parts Holding Europe SAS is Dakar Acquisition SA, a subsidiary of Bain Capital. In
2018 and 2019, the Group paid management fees, including the sponsor fees, in the amount of €1.9 million and
€2.1 million to Dakar Acquisition SA.

**Relations with equity-accounted companies**

Neoparts is an independent distributor with contractual relationships with the Autodistribution purchasing
unit for automotive spare parts.

AD International is a company governed by Belgian law that negotiates preferential tariffs with suppliers for
all members of the AD network. Each year, the Group receives end-of-year rebates depending on the volumes it
has purchased.

Parts Holdings Italy was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group until the Group sold 80% of the shares to
Giadi in 2013.

The Group did not have any significant intercompany transactions with these investees in the years ended
31 December 2019 and 2018. There are no restrictions on the transfer of funds with these entities or any
unrecognized share of losses, in accordance with the equity method.

**Relationship with Parts Holding Europe managers**

At the time of the acquisition of Parts Holding Europe, the new main shareholder, Bain Capital, entered into
an arrangement with certain managers of the Group. Parts Holding Europe managers subscribed to shares in
Dakar Holdings SCA at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.

The Parts Holding Europe managers further agreed to sell back to Bain Capital the shares in Dakar Holdings
SCA in the event they leave the Group before a certain service period. The selling price of the shares is
determined on the basis of a number of conditions including the service period and the nature of the departure
(voluntary or dismissal).

In the Group’s consolidated financial statements, this arrangement was classified within equity, as the
Group did not have any obligation to settle the transaction with the Parts Holding Europe managers. In addition,
since the investment by the Parts Holding Europe managers was measured at fair value, no expense was
recognized in income for the year.

**17.1 Management compensation**

The key management personnel of a group are those persons having authority and responsibility for
planning, managing and supervising the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director
(executive or otherwise) of that entity.

The Group’s key management personnel are the members of the Executive Committee, directors, area
managers and brand general managers.

**19 Events after the end of the reporting period**

**Impact of Covid -19**

Our spare parts distribution and repair activities for light vehicles and trucks were considered by the
government to be essential for the functioning of the country and appear in the list of businesses that can remain
open, by decree of March 15, 2020.

Indeed, our services allow the maintenance of mobility which has been recognized by the government as
essential, even if its exercise is limited. Our platforms and distributors are required to deliver spare parts to the
entire light vehicles and trucks repair sector, including our own network. They are involved in repairing vehicles
potentially used by medical staff or vehicles transporting them. Similarly, workshops can also be required to
repair trucks, essential for supplying stores with foodstuffs, and vehicles of people involved in all activities
which are recognised as essential, to ensure their mobility.

In this period of public transport understandable restriction, a certain number of our fellow citizens—the
medical staff but also the bakeries and supermarkets employees, retirement homes staff, cleaning staff, food
distribution platforms and transport companies employees and many more—must move in compliance with the
rules set by the public authorities. They require spare parts needed to repair their vehicles.

Keep on providing them with our service means contributing, as a responsible and civic company, to the
functioning of the country.

**19 Events after the end of the reporting period (Continued)**

However, even though we wish to contribute to the country’s Economic Continuity Plan, we note a very
significant drop in turnover in some of our entities.

At this stage, these events have a short-term impact on our operations due to the uncertainty about the
duration of the measures implemented and the catch-up effect to be anticipated over the rest of the 2020 financial
year. Furthermore, we do not anticipate any major impact in the medium term, particularly in the time frame of
our strategic plan.

In order to structurally protect the Group and our employees, the following action plan has been taken:

   - partial unemployment measures, depending on local situations.

   - implementation, for each country, of government support, including taxes and social security charges
delays.

   - renewal confidence with our banks.

   - implementation of punctual financing guaranteed by the different countries.

   - daily monitoring of cash disbursements to the most vulnerable of our partners.

In addition, the group has a very good level of cash, enabling it to largely meet its short-term maturities.

The group therefore remains confident in its ability to overcome the negative impacts of this health crisis
and then resume normal activities as soon as the pandemic is over, without assuming its duration.

**Renegotiation of the Revolving Credit Facility**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility was renegotiated to extend it for an additional 54 months,
expiring on August 5, 2024, under the same terms and conditions as before (note 12.1.5).

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by decision of your sole shareholder, we have audited
the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parts Holding Europe for the year ended December 31,
2018.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and
of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2018 and of the results of its operations for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

**Audit Framework**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities
_for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

**Independence**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period
from 1[st] of January 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit
services referred to in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.

**Justification of Assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code
_de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following assessments that, in_
our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the
current period.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole,
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the
consolidated financial statements.

Note 3.3 “Significant judgements and estimates” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
outlines the accounting method used by your company in terms of inventory impairment, year-end rebates
received from suppliers, staff expenses and benefits, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and deferred
tax assets, and the methods that involve estimates.

We have assessed the reasonableness of these estimates. We also verified that this note to the consolidated
financial statement provides appropriate information.

-----

At each closing, the group conducts an impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite
life, and also assesses whether there is any indication of impairment of long-term assets value, as described in
notes 9.1 and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements. We reviewed how this impairment test was
implemented, the data and assumptions used, and the calculations performed by the group. We also verified that
notes 3.3, 7.10, 7.11, 9.2 and 9.1 to the consolidated financial statements provide appropriate information.

**Specific verifications**

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific
verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group’s management report of the President.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial
statements.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the President.

**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit
does not include assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the
company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory
auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence
considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
internal control.

Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.

Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company
to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there
is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor
is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements
and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1 Preparation and approval of the consolidated financial statements**

On 29 March 2019, the Chairman approved Parts Holding Europe SAS’s consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2018.

**2 Information relating to the reporting entity**

Parts Holding Europe SAS is a simplified joint-stock company (société par actions simplifiée) domiciled in
France and registered with the Créteil Trade and Companies Registry under number 488 077 165. It was
incorporated on 18 January 2006 under the corporate name Parts Holdings (France) SAS and subsequently
changed its corporate name to “Parts Holding Europe” on 5 November 2018. The address of its registered office
is 22 Avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France.

The Group is a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and
repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux and Italy. The Group operates in the independent
aftermarkets of the Western European light vehicle spare parts distribution “core” aftermarket and the truck spare
parts distribution and repair “core” aftermarket in France.

The Parts Holding Europe has a share capital of €68.263.141 as of December 31[st], 2018. As a result of the
Group’s acquisition on 8 December 2015, Parts Holding Europe and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”)
are deemed subsidiaries of Dakar Acquisition SA, a Luxembourg-based limited liability company
(société anonyme) whose registered office is located at 4, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Luxembourg Findel
(Luxembourg), registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Registry under number B201035 as the
sole shareholder of Parts Holding Europe. Dakar Acquisition SA is a subsidiary of Dakar Topco Sarl., a
Luxembourg-based private limited company (société a responsabilité limitée) and is the ultimate parent company
of the Group, who is in turn a subsidiary of Bain Capital.

**3 Accounting policies and standards**

The consolidated financial statements of Parts Holding Europe SAS and its subsidiaries have been prepared
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), as adopted by the European Union as of 31 December 2018 and available
on the following website: http://ec.europa.eu/finance/company-reporting/ifrs-financial-statements/index_fr.htm

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, except for
certain categories of assets and liabilities as indicated, in accordance with IFRS principles.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest
million unless otherwise stated.

The Group restated credit lines of Italian entities acquired in 2017 for €18,5 million previously classified in
overdraft and now included in short term financial debt. Business acquisitions (net of cash acquired) in 2017 cash
flow statement have also been restated for €18.5 million (decrease of the cash out). The notes related to the net
debt presentation have also been adjusted (notes 12.1.5, 12.2, 12.3).

**3.1 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB effective at 31 December 2018**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, with the exception of the adoption of the following new
standards and amendments:

**Standards** **Effective date**

IFRS 9—Financial instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers (see Note 4) 1 January 2018

On 24 July 2014, the IASB published the full version of IFRS 9, marking the completion of its project to
replace IAS 39 on financial instruments. IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of
financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model
for financial assets. The Group will apply the new rules prospectively from 1 January 2018, with the practical
expedients permitted under the standard. Comparative information for 2017 will not be restated.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Accounting policies and standards (Continued)**

A detailed analysis of the impairment model for financial assets, and particularly accounts and notes
receivable, was carried out in 2018. The expected credit loss impairment model prescribed by IFRS 9 results in
recognizing impairment losses against accounts and notes receivable not yet due. The impact of this is not
considered material.

**3.2 Standards and interpretations adopted by the IASB whose application is not mandatory at**
**31 December 2018**

The Group has not elected to early adopt the following new and revised standards published by the IASB
but whose application is not yet mandatory. Other standards that were newly issued but are not yet effective at
31 December 2018 are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**Standards** **Effective date**

IFRS 16—Leases (Impact estimation on debt done in 2018) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019
IFRIC23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (IAS12) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019
Amendments IFRS 9—Implementation and disclosures under IFRS 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2019

On 13 January 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16—Leases and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
9 November 2017. IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and will result in
almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is
eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a
financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 is
effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 has
also been applied.

The Group plans to adopt IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019. Starting from this date, the standard provides a
single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise on the assets side, a right of use and as a liability,
the rental obligation (sum of future discounted payments). The right of use will be amortized over the term of the
lease agreements. Leases related to the vehicle fleet and leases related to real estate assets (buildings, platforms)
entered into by the Group fall within the scope of this standard.

At December 31, 2018, the Group mainly holds buildings, vehicles, IT and machinery equipments.

In 2018, the Group identified and analysed all contracts which fall under the IFRS16 scope and finalized the
analysis of potential impacts. During this period, the Group set up a new tool to facilitate the registration of
contracts related to IFRS 16 and to monitor the contracts evolution.

The expected impact on the Group’s debt as at the date of transition is between € 170 million and
€ 180 million.

As of January 1, 2019, the Group will apply the simplified retrospective method of accounting for the
cumulative effect of the initial application as an adjustment to

**3.3 Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires the use of certain significant
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies.

Estimates are made based on a going concern assumption and on information available at the date of their
preparation. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations about future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. When the Group makes estimates and assumptions
concerning the future, the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual
results.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates
are significant to the consolidated financial statements are:

   - Inventory impairment—Note 7.3

   - Deferred tax assets—Notes 13.2

**4 Restatements of previously reported financial statements—IFRS 9 application**

**4.1.1 Financial statements impacts**

IFRS 9 has been applied without restatement of comparative information. The reclassifications and the
adjustment resulting from the new impairment rules are not taken into account in the balance sheet as of
December 31, 2017 but are recognized in the opening balance sheet as at January 1, 2018.

The following tables show the adjustments recorded for each line item. Line items that were not affected by
the changes were not included. As a result, the subtotals and totals disclosed cannot be recalculated from the
numbers provided. The adjustments are explained in more detail below:

**4.1.2 Impact of the standard application**

IFRS 9 supersedes the provisions of IAS 39 relating to the recognition, classification and measurement of
financial assets and financial liabilities, the derecognition of financial instruments, the impairment of financial
assets and hedge accounting. The adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as of January 1, 2018 resulted in
changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognized in the financial statements. In
accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the comparative figures have not been restated.

According to the analysis, the only financial assets that are affected by the new pattern of credit losses
expected under IFRS 9 are trade receivables and loan receivables. The Group does not hold any financial
instruments impacted by the IFRS 9 classification standard. As a result, the Group had to revise its depreciation
method in accordance with IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and loans. The impact of the change in the
impairment method on the Group’s retained earnings and shareholders’ equity is presented below. Although cash
and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss
was not significant.

**4 Restatements of previously reported financial statements—IFRS 9 application (Continued)**

The total impact on the group’s retained earnings as at January 1, 2018 is as follows:

**(in millions of euros)**

**Non-distributed results opening balance at 1 January 2018—IFRS 9** . . . . . . . . . . . . . **30.7**

The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to the measurement of expected credit losses, which uses
a provision for expected loss over the life of all receivables and loans.

**5 Scope of consolidation**

_Consolidation_

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holding Europe SAS and its
controlled entities. Control is assessed as having (i) the power over the investee through voting rights or similar
rights, (ii) exposure to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and (iii) the ability to use power over
the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. Controlled entities are consolidated from the date the
Group obtains control until such time the Group ceases to exercise control.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealized income, expenses, gains and losses that are
included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal transactions are eliminated.

In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in an entity already controlled by the Group, the
difference between the acquisition price of the shares and the additional interest acquired by the Group in
consolidated equity is recorded in stockholders’ equity. The value of the entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities
(including goodwill) for consolidation purposes remains unchanged.

Entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not have control, are accounted for using
the equity method. The investments in such entities are initially recognized at cost, including the goodwill of the
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss, and is subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the
profit or loss in the investee. In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in entities that were previously
accounted for using the equity method that results in the Group obtaining control, the previously held equity
interest is remeasured at fair value and the difference between the fair value and carrying value is recorded as a
gain or loss in the income statement.

When the parent company loses control of a previously consolidated entity, assets and liabilities related to
such entity is derecognized including any goodwill and a gain or loss associated with the loss of control of the
former entity is recognized.

**5.1 Acquisitions and disposals**

Business combinations are recorded in accordance with IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. The
acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS accounting criteria are
recorded at acquisition-date fair value, including any previously held interest but with the exception of
non-current assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets

**5 Scope of consolidation (Continued)**

and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards. The costs directly
attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in which they are incurred.

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where appropriate,
non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s identifiable assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note 9.1 for impairment of goodwill.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities related to acquisitions recorded on a provisional basis are
recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a maximum 12 months of the acquisition
date. After the end of the allocation period, the effects are recorded directly in the income statement unless they
correspond to corrections of errors.

IFRS 10 on Consolidated Financial Statements presents a single consolidation model and provides a
definition of control that includes:

Power over the entity

Exposure, or right, to variable returns of the entity,

The ability to use its power to impact the amount of its returns

Basically a shareholder has control over the entity when it owns more than 50% of the voting rights.
IFRS 10 states that an investor may control an entity with less than 50% of the voting rights and provides specific
guidance for assessing control in such situations.

In accordance with IFRS 10, in the case where the shareholder has the practical capacity to exercise its
substantive voting rights and in the case where such rights are exercisable; these rights must be taken into
account when calculating the percentage of control.

**5.1.1 Acquisitions and disposals in 2018**

**5.1.2.2 Acquisition of a group of distributors in Italy**

On 10 May 2017, Autodis Italia Holding Srl (“Autodis Italia”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Group in
which the Group holds 55% interests, acquired 100% interests in three leading Italian distributors, OVAM, Top
Car and Ricauto for a purchase price of €29.2 million, paid in cash. The organizational structure post-acquisition
is illustrated as follows:

Autodis Group

100%

Autodis Italia Srl

55%

Autodis Italia Holding Srl

100% 100% 100%

Top Car Ricauto OVAM

49% 100% 60% 54%

Sarco Services Sarpi Sirauto

The 45% non-controlling interests in Autodis Italia are held by the former shareholders of OVAM, Top Car
and Ricauto. Autodis Italia holds call options to purchase the remaining 45% non-controlling interests
exercisable from the date of approval of 2019 annual accounts. Autodis Italia also has the option to purchase, in
part, the shares owned by the CEOs of the three entities, contingently exercisable upon certain conditions and
before the date of approval of 2019 annual accounts. The non-controlling interest holders also have put options to
sell their interests to the Group, which is classified as a liability.

Founded in 1963, OVAM is one of the leading Italian stockist-distributors operating in the north and center
of the country. It operates via three platforms located in Pero (Milan), Brescia and Turin.

Founded in 1973 and 1989 respectively, Ricauto and Top Car are two leading Italian stockist-distributors
operating in Padua, in the north-eastern region of Italy. Due to their long-standing association, together they play
a major role within GIADI, Autodistribution’s purchasing group partner in Italy.

The newly formed Autodis Italia immediately became a member of the AD Italy network, and from the date
of acquisition to end of 2017, contributed €71.4 million to the Group’s revenue and €0.4 million to the Group’s
net loss, and revenue of €103.1 million and net income of €1.0 million over the full year 2017. Leveraging the
financial support of the Group and the operational know-how of its shareholders, the new entity aims to become
one of the national leaders in Italy and to attract new independent distributors. Acquisition cost of the transaction
was €3.0 million.

**6 Segment information**

The reportable segments reflect the segmentation used for internal reporting purposes, which is presented to
the Chief Operating Decision Maker and used for monitoring the operations and the performance of the Group.
Each reportable segment is an operating segment identified in accordance with paragraphs 5-10 of IFRS 8
“Operating Segments”. The chief operating decision maker is responsible for managing resources and assessing
the profitability of each operating segment. The chief operating decision maker of the Group was identified as the
Chairman of the Group in charge of strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker does not review
information regarding the Group’s assets and liabilities.

Since the beginning of 2017, the Group’s management has further aligned its internal reporting structure to
its strategic allowing improved monitoring of the Group’s two operating units in France (Light Vehicles and
Trucks) and its international operations in the rest of Western Europe. At the end of 2018, after the acquisition of
Oscaro, the Group added specific monitoring of its digital BtoC activities.

The chief operating decision maker of the Group monitors profitability by revenue and adjusted EBITDA, a
non-GAAP measure which is further defined in the section “Use of adjusted EBITDA” of this note, and by the
following operating segments:

   - The Light Vehicles (“LV”) France reportable segment, including headquarter costs attributable to the
LV France segment.

   - The Trucks reportable segment, including headquarters costs attributable to the Trucks segment.

   - The LV International reportable segment, which includes the following entities:

(i) Belgian Doyen Group

(ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies since May 2017 and those acquired
in 2018

(iii) Geevers group since its acquisition in 2018.

   - The Digital BtoC reportable segment created in 2018 includes Oscaro acquired in the current year.

The central purchasing unit (“CPU”) negotiates purchasing conditions for LV France, Trucks and LV
International, which are then sold to wholly owned distributors and to affiliated independent distributors. As part
of the new segmentation, the CPU’s income statement is now broken down between the four segments. This
breakdown is primarily based on the detailed supplier analysis. The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the
supplier level and each supplier was identified as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing
truck parts only, providing LV International parts only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV
France, Truck and LV International parts, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were further split based on the pro-rata
value of the mix of products purchased.

In addition to the four segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose
activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are
directly attributable to one of these segments. Costs that cannot be attributed to one of the segments are presented
in the “Headquarters” column.

The recoverable amount of goodwill is monitored at the level of each segment (see Note 9.1).

**6.3 Use of adjusted EBITDA**

In assessing the performance of the Group’s business, the Group considers a variety of performance and
financial measures. The key measure used for determining how the Group’s business is performing is Adjusted
EBITDA. Management internally assesses the performance and cash flows on a consolidated basis of each
operating segment on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income from ordinary activities before depreciation and
amortization expenses and adjusted for certain items that the Group believes are non-related to ordinary activities
or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of the business, namely start-up costs related to new
businesses, income and expenses attributable to the implementation of the group transformation plan and the
sponsor fees paid to the shareholders and exceptional one-off expense related to professional conferences.

A reconciliation between Operating income from ordinary activities and Adjusted EBITDA and a
description of the nature of the adjustments are provided below:

**7 Operating performance**

Recurring operating income comprises of revenue, cost of goods sold, personnel costs, external expenses,
taxes other than on income, other operating income and expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. It
also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of services rendered
during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange gains and losses relating to
recurring operating activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

Cost of goods for sale includes purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories and net additions
to inventories depreciation.

Other income and expenses from operations relate to unusual and material events. Other income from
operations can include gains on the disposal of operations and on the disposal of property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets. Other expenses from operations can include losses on the disposal of operations and on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as any cost relating to past disposals, the
costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**7.1 Revenue**

Revenue is recognized when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good
or service to the customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset.

Sales revenue

The Group operates a distribution of spare parts for light vehicles and trucks. Revenue is recognized when
control of the products has transferred. Revenue from sales is recognized based on the price specified in the
contract, including variable considerations if any.

A receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is
unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

Direct flow sales commission

The Group also operates sales of spare parts, equipment and tools delivered directly by suppliers to
independent distributors that do not pass through the Group’s logistics platforms. When such third-party
suppliers other than the Group are involved in providing goods to a customer, the Group assesses whether the
nature of its promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods itself or to
arrange for the suppliers to provide those goods or services. The Group is considered an agent if its performance
obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods by the suppliers and revenue is recognized for the amount of
any commission to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the suppliers to provide
their goods. The commission earned is net of consideration that the Group retains after paying the suppliers the
consideration received in exchange for the goods to be provided by that supplier.

The Group has recognized the following amounts relating to revenue in the consolidated income statement

**2018** **2017**

with customers since all its performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time and there is no significant
financing or special payment terms offered to its customers. Refer to Note 7.4 for changes in receivables during
the years presented.

**7.3 Inventories**

Inventories consist primarily of goods purchased from the third-party suppliers and are typically not further
modified or transformed by the Group. Inventories are valued at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell taking into
account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks related to slow-moving items.

Cost is calculated using the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the reporting period. The cost
of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and allowances, discounts granted by suppliers, as
well as the transportation cost of purchases. Given the fast inventory turnover rate, this method of inventory
costing is deemed to be a good approximation of first-in, first-out valuation methodology.

Significant judgements and estimates

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold products
based on the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

**7.4 Trade receivables**

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such as a
probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group will not be able to
recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is
reduced using an allowance account. The impaired outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed
non-recoverable.

The Group has multiple factoring arrangements with financial institutions.

The Group has entered into a factoring agreement with CGA for customer receivables held by ACR. As of
31 December 2018 and 2017, the Group had sold receivables amounting to €17.8 million and €18.0 million,
respectively.

Doyen group entered into factoring agreements with KBC, Caisse d’Epargne and BNP to factor receivables
for the amount of €10.9 million and €21.2 million as of 31 December 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Under all these factoring arrangements, the Group retains late payment and credit risk and therefore, the
Group continues to recognize the transferred receivables in their entirety in its balance sheet. The amount
repayable under the factoring agreement is presented as secured borrowing and is not offset against the
receivables, in accordance with IAS 39. As of 31 December 2018, the Group had a total available credit line of
€47.5 million under these arrangements, of which €15.3 million was drawn down.

In 2017, the Group entered into a new factoring agreement with Factofrance and transferred its receivable
for the amount of €83.8 million as of 31 December 2018 and for €60.1 million as of 31 December 2017. The full
amount of transferred receivables has been derecognized as the Group does no longer retain the risks and rewards
concurrent to the ownership of these receivables.

At 31 December 2018, the analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired was as follows:

   - Defined benefit plans: In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement
benefits. These plans are largely unfunded. Actuarial gains and losses from valuation of these plans are
recognized immediately in equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

Significant judgements and estimates

An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under the defined benefit plans annually using
the projected unit credit method. These calculations include demographic actuarial assumptions concerning
mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections. Probable future benefits are discounted
using a discount rate with reference to the yield on investment-grade bonds.

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These valuations are
based on assumptions such as the discount, salary increase, staff turnover and mortality rates. Due to the
long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty around these estimates.

**8.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The salary growth rate has been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
long-term salary growth rate was adjusted for the year ended 31 December 2017 based on a study conducted by
the actuarial firm in October 2017.

For mortality rates, tables TGH 05 and TGF 05 have been used, which take into account both gender and
age factors. The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds, such as the 10-year Euro corporates bonds for AA-grade companies. The valuation assumptions used in
the calculations for the periods presented are as follows

**9.1 Goodwill**

In business combinations, goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and,
where appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s identifiable assets
and liabilities. Goodwill is tested where there are indications of impairment and at least once a year in order to
determine whether the carrying amount is less than the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference.

For the purpose of the impairment test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities of a cashgenerating unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs. A CGU is a homogeneous group of assets whose continued use
generates cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

Significant judgements and estimates

The impairment test consists of measuring the CGU’s recoverable amount and comparing it to its carrying
amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The
value in use of a CGU is determined as the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from said
assets based on the economic conditions and the operating assumptions made by the Group management. An
impairment loss recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed upon an increase in the recoverable amount.

acquisitions in these segments benefit the activities of the entire segment due to the Group’s vertically integrated
distribution model (purchasing, logistics and distribution departments). As indicated in Note 6.3, the Group’s
management uses the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA to monitor the synergies arising from
acquisitions at segment level.

In 2018, the goodwill was allocated and tested following the following segments:



- CGU LV Frances;

- CGU Trucks;



   - CGU LV International.

_Determination of the recoverable value_


**_LV France_**

At 31 December 2016, the assets tested were valued at €306.2 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use of €847.3 million, calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount
rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €762.5 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%.
Since this is higher than the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2018, the trucks CGU’s goodwill is exclusively composed by the goodwill related to the
acquisition of Bisensang group in March 2017. At 31 December 2018, the assets tested were valued at
€48.9 million. This amount was compared with their value in use of €50.5 million, calculated based on the
present value of future cash flows using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
test was performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €45.5 million in the event that objectives in
the business plan were achieved at 90%. No asset impairment was recognised.

At 31 December 2018, the assets tested were valued at €324.6 million. This amount was compared with
their value in use of €490.7 million, calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using a discount
rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was performed which showed that the
valuation would amount to €441.6 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%,
above the carrying amount of the net assets tested. No sensitivity test was performed on a perpetual growth rate
because of the significant margin given by the impairment test result. As the value in use is greater than the net
book value of the assets tested, no impairment of assets has been recognized.

Oscaro and its subsidiaries were acquired on November 13, 2018, at which time the fair value of the
purchase price was determined and the provisional goodwill of € 140.1 million was recognized as part of the
allocation. the fair value of the purchase price. See Note 5.1.1.3 which details the allocation of the fair value of
the purchase price. The allocation of goodwill among the different CGUs has not yet been completed. Since the
assets were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date in November 2018 and no significant event indicates any
potential impairment loss, no valuation was performed at December 31, 2018 and no impairment loss has been
recorded.


**9.2 Other intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost. Intangible assets acquired in connection
with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Costs relating to intangible assets
created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.

In accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”, development expenses are are capitalized as an intangible
asset when the following criteria are met:



- the technical feasibility of the project is demonstrated;

- the intention exists to finish the project and use or sell the products created during the project;



- the ability to use or sell the products created during the project is demonstrated;

- a potential market for the products created during the project exists or their usefulness, in case of
internal use, is demonstrated, leading one to believe that the project will generate probable future
economic benefits;



- adequate resources are available to complete the project; and



   - the expenditure attributable to the project during its development phase can be reliably measured.

Compliant with IAS 38, research expenses, or development expenses that do not meet the criteria set out
above, are recorded as expenses in the year in which they are incurred.


Intangible assets with a finite useful life

Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives for accounting purposes and
are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Amortization of intangible
assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on
the intangible asset’s function. The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise
Movex accounting software licenses, as well as capitalized development costs.


F-125

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**9 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Continued)**

Amortization begins when the asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful life:

Software (licences) 5 years

Capitalized development costs 2 to 5 years

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a
year on 31 December, either individually or at the level of the CGU to which they belong, and whenever there is
an indication that they may be impaired.

Impairment

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated amortization
and impairment. The assets are tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its net carrying
amount, where the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in
use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent on
the cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in
the income statement in the appropriate expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset. An
assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously identified indication of
impairment has decreased or no longer exists. In this case, the Group estimates the recoverable amount and an
impairment loss previously recorded is reversed to the asset’s recoverable amount. When an impairment loss is
reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,
less depreciation and amortization, had no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An
impairment loss reversal is recorded in the income statement.

Significant judgements and estimates

The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a
year at the reporting date. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually
at the reporting date in order to determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment is still justified. If it is
not, the change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

For the purpose of impairment testing, value in use is determined using the projected future cash flows
based on the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee, discounted by applying a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An
appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less costs to sell.

**_Autodistribution brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand recognized at the time of the acquisition of Parts Europe (formerly Autodis)
on 28 February 2006 by Parts Holding Europe (formerly Autodis Group) is allocated to the LV France and
Trucks CGUs. The net carrying value of the brand is amounted to €156.9 million as of 31 December 2018 and
2017.

On 31 December 2018, the Group carried out a valuation of the Autodistribution brand using the same
approach as 2017. The assumptions used include a discount rate of 10.5%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a perpetuity
growth rate of 1%. This valuation showed a brand value of €191.7 million. Although this is higher than the
carrying amount of €156.9 million, there is no additional impairment previously recorded that can be reversed
and therefore, the Autodistribution brand continues to be carried at its current carrying value.

**_Mondial Pare-Brise brand_**

The “Mondial Pare-Brise” brand recognized at the time of the acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise on
22 March 2017 by the Group is allocated to the LV France CGU. The net carrying value of the brand is amounted
to €13.8 million as of 31 December 2017. Given the brand was recognized at fair value at the time of acquisition
in March 2017, separate valuation was not performed as of 31 December 2018. Refer to Note 5.1.2.1 for details
of assumptions used to value the brand.


**9.3 Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures, are carried
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Routine maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following useful
lives:


Properties 25 years
Equipment and machinery 10 years
General fixtures and fittings 5 years
Transportation equipment 5 years
Furnishings 5 years
IT equipment 2 years


The useful lives of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified when necessary on
each annual reporting date.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized when it is disposed of or when no further future
economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from derecognizing an asset (calculated
on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on disposal and the net carrying amount) is recorded in
the income statement in the year in which it is derecognized.

**11 Provisions**

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implied) arising as a result of a
past event, when it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be necessary in
order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. In the ordinary course of
its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating to industrial disputes, commercial
disputes, etc. In such cases, in conjunction with its legal advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the
disputes and assesses the probability that an outflow of resources will be required to settle them.

When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an insurance
policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The amount of the expense
corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of any refunds.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a current rate
before tax, which reflects the risks specific to the liability. When the provision is discounted, the increase relating
to the passage of time is recorded as a financial expense.

Changes in current provisions are as follows:

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automotive spare parts in France, sued
Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de Commerce) for the
sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is for approximately €2.4 million. No
provision was booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018. The Commercial
Court handed down a judgment on 23 March 2017 that exonerated Gadest and Autodistribution, and retained the
potential liability of three other subsidiaries, adding that the €0.3 million in compensation is secured by Klarius’
English parent companies in collective proceedings. This judgement is not enforceable. In this context, Group
confirms its historical position and consider that the probability of an outflow of resources has not been
demonstrated, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the lawsuit. An appeal in “cassation” was
formulated on October 11, 2018 by the liquidator of Klarius. The Group is therefore awaiting briefs and a date
for oral argument.

**12 Financial assets and liabilities**

Financial assets

IFRS 9 introduces a classification approach for financial assets, either at amortized cost or at fair value. The
financial asset is classified in its entirety and is not subject to complex rules of decomposition.

Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets should be classified and measured:

   - the business model of the entity for the management of financial assets, and

   - the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial asset.

For a financial asset in the scope of IFRS 9, there are 3 types of economic models:

   - If the objective of the business model is exclusively to hold financial assets to cash out contractual cash
flows: the financial asset is measured at amortized cost.

   - If the objective of the business model is both to hold financial assets to cash out in contractual cash
flows and to sell financial assets: the financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss.

F-131

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12 Financial assets and liabilities (Continued)**

   - If financial assets that are not held in any of the two business models above are measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

The Group’s financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and in the
category of financial assets measured at amortized cost.

Financial liabilities

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest rate
method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are recognized over the term of the
loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortized issue costs are presented as a deduction from the
liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized through the
amortized cost mechanism.

Fair value

IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as effective for as of 1 July 2014, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

Level 1: prices on the valuation date for identical instruments to those being valued, quoted on an active
market to which the entity has access;

Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from extrapolations).This
level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is obliged to rely on its own assumptions
to assess the data that other market participants would have applied to price other instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents are measured at level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment of dividends to
shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares. The Group does not have any equity-based
covenants.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**12 Financial assets and liabilities (Continued)**

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under finance
leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The financial instruments are
contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The Group has other financial assets such as
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, which are generated directly by its
operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange
risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing these risks are summarized below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimize debt to equity ratios and the financial leverage
obtained by debt.

**12.6.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows at fixed and variable rates, and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk on the portion of
debt corresponding to the €515.0 million Senior Secured Notes paying interest at Euribor +4.375%.

An increase in the 3-month Euribor rate would have the following impacts on the interest costs related to the
Senior Secured Floating Notes:

**3-month Euribor**
**0.00%** **0.10%** **0.20%** **0.30%** **0.50%** **0.70%** **1.00%**
**(in millions of euros)**
**Interest cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 22.5 23.0 23.6 24.1 25.1 26.1 27.7

**12.6.2 Foreign exchange risk**

Following the disposal of the Poland business, as explained in Note 5.1.2.4, the Group does not have any
subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than euro.

**12.6.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain payment
credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce its credit
default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment history, past or present
financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure relates to
potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure equals the carrying amount of these
instruments.

**12.6.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing through
the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

**12.6.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a good credit
risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise value for shareholders

**13 Income tax**

The Group opted for tax consolidation in France. This option concerns all the Group’s French companies
with the exception of non-material subsidiaries.

**13 Income tax (Continued)**

_Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are valued at the
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws applied to
determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the
income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution Economique
_Territoriale—CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée_
_des Entreprises—CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods for determining said contribution with regard to_
the provisions adopted by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the
French national accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité—CNC) and it concluded that this
contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been
classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

**13.2 Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences existing at the
reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the statement of
financial position.

Deferred tax liabilities are recorded for any taxable timing differences while deferred tax assets are recorded for
any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is
probable that a taxable profit will be available against which they may be offset. Deferred tax assets and

F-139


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**13 Income tax (Continued)**

liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year in which the asset is realized or the
liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules) enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred taxes related to items recognized directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the income
statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and when they
relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority.

Significant judgements and estimates

The calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate
how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of tax
management strategies. Recognized deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s six-year
business plan for the year ended 31 December 2017 and of five-year business plan for the years ended
31 December 2016 and 2015.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it no longer
appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some or all of said deferred tax
assets can be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized if it
becomes likely that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (which allows offset of income from companies
in a previous tax group against losses in the new tax group in which they belong) for companies Parts Europe
(formerly Autodis) consolidates for tax purposes. This tax consolidation group’s tax loss carry-forwards were
offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an expanded base in 2018. There is also a French
tax consolidation group whose parent company is Parts Holding Europe and which includes the companies
acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax base (previously consolidated with Parts Europe for
tax purposes).

In 2018, the French tax consolidation group result is nihil. In 2017, the tax group generated a tax benefits of
€0.4 million.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**13 Income tax (Continued)**

According to French Finance Act of 2013, effective as of 31 December 2012, loss carry-forward is limited
to €1.0 million plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount. Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of
the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the tax loss carry-forwards. The result obtained is then included in the
Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also
applies.

A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the six-year business plan
for France to determine the future utilization of tax loss carry-forwards in light of existing offset rules and to
assess the deferred tax asset to be recognized in the financial statements at 31 December 2018.

This exercise shows that €231.3 million in tax loss carry-forwards would be utilized, i.e., a tax saving of
€64.3 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of the business
plan, the deferred tax asset recognized in the financial statements was limited to this amount.

At 31 December 2018, tax loss carry-forwards, after utilizing €28.5 million in 2018, stood at €118.8 million
for the expanded base and €284.6 million for the Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group in France.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse in the long
term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2019 budget and the five-year business
plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax assets after the said period, except as a
deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the reporting date. At 31 December 2018, unrecognized
tax loss carry-forwards amounts to €168.4 million.

**17 Transactions with related parties (Continued)**

**Relationship with Parts Holding Europe managers**

At the time of the acquisition of Parts Holding Europe, the new main shareholder, Bain Capital, entered into
an arrangement with certain managers of the Group. Parts Holding Europe managers subscribed to shares in
Dakar Holdings SCA at a price that approximates the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.

The Parts Holding Europe managers further agreed to sell back to Bain Capital the shares and preferred
equity certificates (“PECs”) in Dakar Holdings SCA in the event they leave the Group before a certain service
period. The selling price of the shares and PECs is determined on the basis of a number of conditions including
the service period and the nature of the departure (voluntary or dismissal).

In the Group’s consolidated financial statements, this arrangement was classified within equity, as the
Group did not have any obligation to settle the transaction with the Parts Holding Europe managers. In addition,
since the investment by the Parts Holding Europe managers was measured at fair value, no expense was
recognized in income for the year.

**17.1 Management compensation**

The key management personnel of a group are those persons having authority and responsibility for
planning, managing and supervising the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director
(executive or otherwise) of that entity.

The Group’s key management personnel are the members of the Executive Committee, directors, area
