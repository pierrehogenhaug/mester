1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain, with over 55 years of experience. Since the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline) distributor in the business-to-business (“B2B”), business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) segments. We hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by our unique operational model and value-added services proposition, our history of organic growth and valueaccretive acquisition-led growth as well as our strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, we generated revenue of €1,782.9 million, an Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of €197.8 million and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €219.9 million. In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”), was reported in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus has since spread, and infections have been found in the vast majority of countries around the world, including throughout Europe. Following an increase in sales and Adjusted EBITDA for the two months ended February 29, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA declined sharply in the second half of March 2020 and in April 2020 as a result of the lockdown measures implemented in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in the markets in which we operate. Notwithstanding, the IAM has showed structural resilience during this period, supported by strong market fundamentals such as the non-discretionary nature of the services we provide combined with a low risk of trading down from end-customers since spare parts available in the IAM are more affordable. In May 2020, when the lockdown measures impacting our markets were progressively eased, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA recovered to a level comparable to May 2019. In June 2020, we continued to benefit from the easing of the lockdown measures in our geographies and our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to June 2019. Financial information for any period following March 31, 2020, is based on management accounts, which have not been audited or reviewed.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.1,"Leader in the resilient, predictable and structurally growing Western European market","We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France (29% market share in 2018 in terms of revenue) and we hold leading positions around Western Europe (based on a study commissioned by us in 2019). In 2018, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM distributor in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands and we entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the acquisition of 75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain. We operate in the Western European light vehicle distribution “core” aftermarket that is structurally resilient in the face of macroeconomic factors that impact the broader automotive industry and distribution markets. While new car sales tend to fluctuate with economic cycles, the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket benefits from a steadily growing installed car parc and the recurring need for maintenance and repairs to be made to the existing car parc, irrespective of downturns in the economy. New car sales only account for a small portion of the overall car parc. Approximately 2.6 million new cars were sold in France in 2018, compared with a car parc of approximately 38 million cars in total. Moreover, in economic downturns customers generally favor IAM distributors, such as us, over OE distributors due to longer car ownership, as new car sales decrease, as well as increased price-sensitivity. For example, after a sharp decline at the end of March and beginning of April 2020, the French light vehicle spare parts market showed resilience and a significant recovery at the beginning of May 2020, also due to a generalized decline in the use public transport as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which favored car usage. The IAMs in which we operate show particular strength and growth potential due to two long-term market dynamics: a stable, slightly increasing Western European car parc and an increase in average vehicle age which are expected to drive growth in the number of cars that need service by light vehicle IAM distributors like us in the coming years. Between 2014 and 2018, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket grew at a CAGR of 1.9%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc, while the Western European light vehicle IAM grew more quickly and gained market share, at a CAGR of 2.9%. The French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket revenues and light vehicle IAM revenues are forecast to grow by 1% and 1.6% over the 2018 to 2025 period. The Western European light vehicle IAM is also expected to continue outperforming both the broader market and its OE car dealer network competitors in the 2018 to 2025 period. The existing car parc’s age and mileage increase due to growing mobility needs, including car sharing or long-term leasing, and increasing the need for maintenance and repair. In France, the average mileage per passenger vehicle has grown 2 ----- steadily by approximately 1% per year over the 2011-2016 period. We believe that we will be well positioned to take advantage of this evolution of mobility as distributors associated with a large garage network, such as us, are expected to be partners of choice of fleet managers. Light vehicle IAM distributors also have the benefit of a high level of visibility in terms of the future addressable market of cars needing service and repair. The addressable market for the light vehicle IAM is cars aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a result, we can project the size and composition of the car parc that will require service in the five to ten-year range because car parc size, vehicle types and installed technology are known from the point of production. We generally service cars over a long period of time (from five to twenty years), which may require multiple repairs and parts replacements over their lifespan. We distribute parts for cars that span the entire car parc, covering a wide range of makes and models, giving us a wider addressable market compared to our OE car dealer network competitors who generally distribute parts for cars from just one manufacturer.",,as_expected,2020,482,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""We operate in the Western European light vehicle distribution \u201ccore\u201d aftermarket that is structurally resilient in the face of macroeconomic factors that impact the broader automotive industry and distribution markets.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": ""We operate in the Western European light vehicle distribution \u201ccore\u201d aftermarket that is structurally resilient in the face of macroeconomic factors that impact the broader automotive industry and distribution markets.""}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": ""We operate in the Western European light vehicle distribution \u201ccore\u201d aftermarket that is structurally resilient in the face of macroeconomic factors that impact the broader automotive industry and distribution markets."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Leader in the resilient, predictable and structurally growing Western European market\nText: We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France (29% market share in 2018 in terms of revenue) and we hold leading positions around Western Europe (based on a study commissioned by us in 2019).

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.2,Well-known light vehicle and truck spare parts distributor with critical scale in a fragmented Western European market,"In addition to the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket being highly attractive, economies of scale favor larger distributors such as ourselves. Extensive logistics, technology and network investments are necessary to service a broad and fragmented customer base seeking the supply of several million SKUs for rapid and continuous delivery and the difficulty in building sufficient brand awareness and long-term relationships with suppliers that are necessary to negotiate competitive pricing. As a result, suppliers can secure more business when going through us to distribute their products as they can access a wide range of customers, and therefore they also benefit from our scale. The necessary investments to deliver economies of scale in our market also present a barrier to entry to competitors in a currently fragmented market. The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is fragmented with the top 10 players in Europe representing approximately 17% of the market in 2018, which also provides significant potential for consolidation, giving an edge to large distributors, such as ourselves, who are able to service the entire value chain and make strategic acquisitions. The increasing technical complexity of spare parts in the automotive industry is also favorable to us. The higher complexity and value of repair operations are difficult to manage by small independent aftermarket players without support and technical assistance from expert distributors such as ourselves and drives a strong and structural increase in spare parts prices and margins. Future technological evolutions are partly driven by the increasing popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles and of mobility and connectivity services. We forecast that 5.1% of addressable cars will be electric or hybrid by 2030. We also believe that by 2030 up to 1.1% of addressable cars will benefit from automated driving systems which will result in higher prices of components for these vehicles. Furthermore, as a result of the focus on safety and aesthetics, light vehicle body parts have improved in quality, from steel-made to aluminum and carbon fiber-made products, which has also increased prices of the body parts that we distribute. A carbon fiber bumper, for example, is four times more expensive than the current glass fiber bumpers. We are able to combine the significant advantage of having a well-known and trusted core brand with the ability to use affiliated garage networks to target specific markets. Our superior brand awareness is evidence of our strong positioning in the IAMs in which we operate. According to an independent third-party survey conducted in France in 2017, the “Autodistribution” brand enjoyed the highest brand awareness among its light vehicle distributor peers in France, with 92% brand awareness (including unprompted awareness of 74% and prompted awareness of 18%).

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.3,Differentiated and successfully integrated omni-channel business model,"One of our key strengths is our control over the value chain through our omni-channel operational model that delivers superior product availability and best-in-class delivery lead times. Our distribution is carried out by a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who distribute our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail locations and online players. Our ability to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and distribution, to customers has a strong impact on margins. For example, our automated platforms enable us to centralize more 3 ----- flows, which in turn generates logistics fees from suppliers. Generally, the logistics fees we charge to suppliers are greater than the logistics costs we incur. Our unique operational model is founded on our long-standing relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms and an extensive Western European distribution network. We have a broad and loyal customer base to whom we deliver a wide range of value-added services. We have also been able to adapt this business model to the markets in which we operate. We have also been able to adapt this business model to our markets in Belgium and Italy, where distribution is organized in three steps with “jobbers” acting as intermediaries between distributors and B2B end-customers (these jobbers are our direct customers instead of garages). Our model is based on the distinctive, dual proposition of distributing products to customers coupled with providing value-added services (many of which are digital or online services) to both suppliers and customers. To suppliers, our scale offers a unique access to a wide, diversified and fragmented customer base, which suppliers are not able to efficiently address themselves. We have built long-term relationships and enjoy significant purchasing power with a strategically concentrated group of suppliers, with whom we can leverage our scale to obtain excellent purchasing conditions for our CPUs. Through this supplier concentration strategy, we have rationalized our supplier relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260 in 2019. We also offer suppliers a number of value-added services, such as marketing support and access to our state-of-the-art automated warehousing capabilities which allow suppliers to arrange deliveries to a single delivery point. 4 ----- To customers, we provide a comprehensive product offering and best-in-class delivery times (h+2 delivery time on 90% of B2B customer demand) combined with value-added services, such as commercial, technical and training support, strong and integrated branding and online tools. As a result of our combined product and services offerings, we are a “one-stop” shop to our customers, which we believe strengthens customer loyalty and drives market share gain. Unlike many of our competitors, our product range is not limited to certain OEM or original equipment suppliers (“OES”) parts or to certain types of products. Our product offering covers approximately 600,000 SKUs (excluding Oscaro) across the spare parts universe, including repair and maintenance parts, body parts, repairer equipment, oil, tires, consumables and accessories. Additionally, we have developed our own private label brands: ISOTECH, Xenergy and Requal, which allow us to offer premium grade products approximately 20% to 30% cheaper than our OEM counterparts and to efficiently target the older part of the car parc which is subject to a higher price sensitivity. The ongoing centralization of sourcing across our private label brands allows us to generate higher margins on our private label products compared to third-party branded products, despite the lower price of the former. We are also well positioned to address mobility shifts, in particular with our customers involved in fleet management, through which public fleets play an increasingly important role. With our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and extensive range of value-added customer service solutions, we are well positioned to meet the needs of fleet operators who look to external supply and fleet management on a large scale. In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution models for our Light Vehicle France and Trucks segments, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic investments in our automated logistics platforms. We are currently finalizing the implementation of a new distribution model for our Trucks segment which has allowed us to grow our network of affiliated garages and to reorganize our former network of 125 distribution sites around 10 regional warehouses as of December 31, 2019, which can better focus on distribution to local sites, owned and independent garages and integrated workshops. As a result of this reorganization, we have been able to better utilize our large network and unique range of value-added services to meet customer demand and we became the only player in the French truck spare parts market able to serve our full range of customers with two daily deliveries made within four hours.",,as_expected,2020,482,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Differentiated and successfully integrated omni-channel business model\nText: One of our key strengths is our control over the value chain through our omni-channel operational model that delivers superior product availability and best-in-class delivery lead times.

We also offer suppliers a number of value-added services, such as marketing support and access to our state-of-the-art automated warehousing capabilities which allow suppliers to arrange deliveries to a single delivery point. 4 ----- To customers, we provide a comprehensive product offering and best-in-class delivery times (h+2 delivery time on 90% of B2B customer demand) combined with value-added services, such as commercial, technical and training support, strong and integrated branding and online tools. As a result of our combined product and services offerings, we are a \u201cone-stop\u201d shop to our customers, which we believe strengthens customer loyalty and drives market share gain. Unlike many of our competitors, our product range is not limited to certain OEM or original equipment suppliers (\u201cOES\u201d) parts or to certain types of products. Our product offering covers approximately 600,000 SKUs (excluding Oscaro) across the spare parts universe, including repair and maintenance parts, body parts, repairer equipment, oil, tires, consumables and accessories. Additionally, we have developed our own private label brands: ISOTECH, Xenergy and Requal, which allow us to offer premium grade products approximately 20% to 30% cheaper than our OEM counterparts and to efficiently target the older part of the car parc which is subject to a higher price sensitivity. The ongoing centralization of sourcing across our private label brands allows us to generate higher margins on our private label products compared to third-party branded products, despite the lower price of the former. We are also well positioned to address mobility shifts, in particular with our customers involved in fleet management, through which public fleets play an increasingly important role. With our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and extensive range of value-added customer service solutions, we are well positioned to meet the needs of fleet operators who look to external supply and fleet management on a large scale. In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution models for our Light Vehicle France and Trucks segments, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic investments in our automated logistics platforms. We are currently finalizing the implementation of a new distribution model for our Trucks segment which has allowed us to grow our network of affiliated garages and to reorganize our former network of 125 distribution sites around 10 regional warehouses as of December 31, 2019, which can better focus on distribution to local sites, owned and independent garages and integrated workshops. As a result of this reorganization, we have been able to better utilize our large network and unique range of value-added services to meet customer demand and we became the only player in the French truck spare parts market able to serve our full range of customers with two daily deliveries made within four hours.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

Over the same period, profitability also grew. In the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA was €83.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.6%. In the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 increased to €202.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin was 11.2%. The average organic growth in Adjusted EBITDA was approximately 6.3% per annum over the 2015 to 2019 period. Our organic growth has been supported by various factors, such as the development of our distribution model (which has bolstered our offering to customers, thus leading to market share gains), our exposure to fastgrowing channels (such as web dealers), our successful recruiting of new branded garages, the development of our private-label offers, improved purchasing conditions obtained through our supplier concentration strategy and our distribution network optimization strategy. In recent years we have demonstrated stable organic growth overall, particularly in the resilient light vehicle IAM, as a result of good purchasing conditions with suppliers, network rationalization, recruitment of approximately 70 AD branded garages (net) per year from 2010 to 2019 with a churn rate of less than 5% and the disposal of non-core assets.

Each of these acquisitions has been supported by a clear external growth strategy focused on neighboring European countries with similar car parcs to France and targeting strong local leaders with potential to quickly generate purchasing synergies, align interests with management, expand the reach of our operations and increase exposure to fast-growing segments and markets. We have a strong track record of successful integrations in our Group, and our acquisitions have demonstrated favorable pre- and post-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiples (calculated as enterprise value divided by EBITDA) as well as our ability to grow revenue and EBITDA following an acquisition: - _ACR: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 4x; - _Doyen-Auto: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 12x, as compared with post- synergy multiple of approximately 5x; - _Mondial Pare-Brise: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 9x, as compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 6x; and - _OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 10x, as compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 7x. 6 ----- In addition, we implemented various initiatives following our acquisition of Oscaro and brought Oscaro back to profitability in the third quarter of the year 2019 and reaching positive EBITDA for the full year 2019.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strategy,9.3.1,Continue to reinforce our distribution models to gain market share on the French light vehicle IAM,"In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution model for our Light Vehicle France segment, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic investments in our automated logistics platforms. We aim to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer service, rationalize flows and optimize inventory and warehousing. We focus on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the regional level, while maintaining excellent delivery times. For example, since 2014, we have redesigned and refined our Light Vehicle France distribution model, moving from a large number of delivery sites acting as intermediaries between suppliers and our logistics platforms and garage customers, to a more precisely deployed network of regional pivot sites that connect suppliers and our logistics platforms with local delivery sites, which are strategically located to address customer demand. A key component of this strategy is our ongoing efforts to grow our affiliated network of garages. In 2017, we further enhanced our Light Vehicle France distribution model by introducing a fully automated national logistic platform (Logisteo) that enabled same-day stock deliveries to distributors in France.

We aim to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer service, rationalize flows and optimize inventory and warehousing. We focus on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the regional level, while maintaining excellent delivery times. For example, since 2014, we have redesigned and refined our Light Vehicle France distribution model, moving from a large number of delivery sites acting as intermediaries between suppliers and our logistics platforms and garage customers, to a more precisely deployed network of regional pivot sites that connect suppliers and our logistics platforms with local delivery sites, which are strategically located to address customer demand. A key component of this strategy is our ongoing efforts to grow our affiliated network of garages. In 2017, we further enhanced our Light Vehicle France distribution model by introducing a fully automated national logistic platform (Logisteo) that enabled same-day stock deliveries to distributors in France. Logisteo allowed us to significantly improve our distribution model by increasing the consolidation of our supply flows to a single delivery point from 18% in 2014 to 64% in 2018 resulting in approximately 30% gain in productivity. We expect that our new model will further improve distributor performance with optimized inventory levels and SKU availability and an increased ability to adapt our offer to local customer requirements, leading to an enhanced customer experience.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strategy,9.3.4,Reinforce cost efficiency initiatives at both local distribution and central and administrative levels,"We operate a fully-integrated supply chain that connects our strategically concentrated group of suppliers to our CPUs and state-of-the-art logistics platforms, through to an extensive distribution network that serves more than 70,000 customers with deliveries several times per day and with best-in-class delivery times. We intend to build on our history of operational excellence by continuing to integrate and rationalize our supply chain to improve cost efficiency. We believe this approach will help us maintain and further enhance our strong and unique positioning as a central distribution intermediary for all value chain levels and to reinforce our role as an important link between parts suppliers and customers. Based on the value that we have extracted from operational improvements in recent years, we believe that continual improvements to our supply chain will contribute to increased market share and expanded margins. For example, our increasing use of centralized, automated platforms simplifies the delivery processes for our suppliers by offering them a single delivery point. We also offer suppliers a range of innovative value-added services such as marketing tools and intelligence, online support tools, payment guarantees and a centralized invoicing system with simplified back office support, all of which help suppliers grow their own business while creating greater efficiencies through simplified tracking, delivery, monitoring and payment solutions. We believe that these services represent advantages that are a “win-win” proposition for us and our suppliers, differentiating us from our competitors. We are also pursuing increased integration of our supply chain, which is based on two flows of spare parts: a “direct delivery flow” from suppliers to distributors and a “platform-based flow” through our logistics platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2019, 64% of our products were distributed via our logistics platform, as compared with 18% in 2010, representing an improvement that we intend to pursue by further developing our platform-based flow. This approach is expected to improve product availability and delivery times while being cost efficient and generating favorable financial conditions for us, due in part to the higher logistics fees which we can apply in this context, and which we expect will lead to higher margins, as the logistics fees received from suppliers generally exceed the related costs of operating the logistics platforms. In particular, our new, automated platforms, such as Logisteo, generally offer a doubled capacity for SKUs as well as doubled processing capacity, allowing us to offer more SKUs from a wider range of product lines and suppliers. We will pursue this strategy by encouraging new suppliers to make deliveries through the platform flow from the outset as well as by having existing supplies expand the breadth of their range offered through our platform-based flow. In addition, we believe that our extensive distribution network is a key part to our success. We employ a cost-conscious approach to manage our distribution network, constantly focusing on improving network efficiency and coverage, while minimizing or eliminating redundancies wherever possible. For example, in our Light Vehicle France segment, we are currently focused on ongoing upgrades to our real estate parc and improvements to the size and coverage of our footprint of distribution sites in France. When and where necessary, we remodel, close or consolidate sites. We also work to lower and rationalize downstream logistics costs by maximizing the square footage of our sites and by modernizing our logistics and monitoring functions, such as through the increased use of bar coding and the creation of a dedicated logistics department. In our Trucks segment, we are implementing an improvement plan that is focused on closing low- and non-performing sites in the context of a broader profit-focused effort to optimize our distribution network. 9 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Reinforce cost efficiency initiatives at both local distribution and central and administrative levels\nText: We operate a fully-integrated supply chain that connects our strategically concentrated group of suppliers to our CPUs and state-of-the-art logistics platforms, through to an extensive distribution network that serves more than 70,000 customers with deliveries several times per day and with best-in-class delivery times.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Recent Developments,9.6.1,Actions implemented following the COVID-19 outbreak,"In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”), was reported in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus has since spread, and infections have been found in the vast majority of countries around the world, including throughout Europe. In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic based on the global spread of the disease, the severity of illnesses it causes and its effects on society. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries, states and cities have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes. Accordingly, the COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity in many countries, including in regions in which we operate, and continues to adversely impact global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. For a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our results for the three months ended March 31, 2020, see “Management’s discussion and _analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to three months ended March 31, 2019.”_ During the initial phase of the lockdown, we retained a limited level of activity following our decision to remain open as a corporate citizen (“Entreprise Citoyenne”) in all our markets, notably to help public services and essential workers fighting the pandemic. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took immediate action to help our employees and partners during the crisis and to ensure the continuity of essential mobility in France. We also provided remote working solutions to all eligible employees and put in place dedicated processes to ensure high levels of safety for our workforces in the distribution activity. Since May 11, 2020, the French government has lifted the strict lockdown and has gradually removed restrictions and social distancing measures. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the majority of our employees have physically returned to work and our remote working activities have almost ceased. During the initial phase of the lockdown measures, we implemented certain cost control measures by (1) leveraging government initiatives in the markets in which we operate, such as the French temporary unemployment scheme (chômage partiel), and (2) implementing a temporary freeze on discretionary spending and capital expenditures. These targeted measures have helped to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our profitability. For a discussion of the financial impact of COVID-19 see “—COVID-19 financial impact and _recovery.”_ We also took pro-active steps to protect our liquidity by (1) taking advantage of government incentives such as tax and/or social charges deferral, (2) entering into government-backed financing or additional credit lines with local banks in the markets in which we operate (see “—COVID-19 related financing”), (3) undertaking constructive discussions with our largest suppliers to obtain the earlier payment of year-end rebates, and to adapt the timing of our payments to suppliers accordingly, and (4) enhancing cash collections from our customers, despite granting payment deferrals to our most affected customers and partners. We also anticipate a positive impact on liquidity from the CICE tax credit. As a result of these measures, we had €167.8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020 and approximately €173 million of cash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2020. We estimate that our cash on balance sheet as of June 22, 2020 was approximately €135 million after excluding the one-off working capital impact of the measures we took to preserve our liquidity following the COVID-19 outbreak. This liquidity position reflects a net drawdown of approximately €8.5 million of new debt facilities as of June 22, 2020, but does not reflect approximately €50 million of additional credit lines that may be drawn subsequently, including under the PGE Loan and other COVID-19 related financing arrangements that we have entered into or that we are in the process of obtaining in certain of our markets (see “—COVID-19 related financing”) . 12 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Actions implemented following the COVID-19 outbreak\nText: In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), was reported in Wuhan, China.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Recent Developments,9.6.2,COVID-19 financial impact and recovery,"_April 2020_ Our revenue decreased in April 2020 by 47.1% from €147.9 million for the month ended April 30, 2019, to approximately €78.3 million for the month ended April 30, 2020, and our organic revenue decreased by 48.3% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. We had negative Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €1.7 million for the month ended April 30, 2020, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of €12.7 million for the month ended April 30, 2019. This decrease in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA was due to the impact of the initial lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 in the markets in which we operate. This decrease was partly offset by the mitigating measures that we implemented and our ability to attract new customers, which represented approximately 20% of our sales during the initial lockdown period in France. During this period, we have also benefited from our diversified business model, with operations in markets less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the Netherlands, and the resilience of online sales through Oscaro. We had a positive change in working capital of €14.1 million for the month ended April 30, 2020, compared to a negative change in working capital of €7.6 million for the month ended April 30, 2019. Our net capital expenditures were €1.2 million for the month ended April 30, 2020, compared to €2.6 million for the month ended April 30, 2019. Our net operating cash flow was €10.4 million for the month ended April 30, 2020, compared to €2.5 million for the month ended April 30, 2019. _May 2020_ Our revenue decreased by 14.4% from €147.6 million for the month ended May 31, 2019, to approximately €126.3 million for the month ended May 31, 2020, and our organic revenue decreased by 17.1% in May 2020 compared to May 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA in May 2020 decreased by approximately €3.7 million, or 26.5%, from €13.9 million for the month ended May 31, 2019, to €10.2 million for the month ended May 31, 2020. This decrease in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA was due to the impact of the lockdown measures in the markets in which we operate. Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in May 2020 were positively impacted by the easing of the strict lockdown measures from May 11, 2020, particularly in France and Italy. In addition, we benefited in May from our decision to remain open during the initial phase of the lockdown as our business was operational when governments started to ease lockdown measures. Our Adjusted EBITDA also benefitted from the cost control measures implemented at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. We had a positive change in working capital of €20.4 million for the month ended May 31, 2020, compared to a negative change in working capital of €17.6 million for the month ended May 31, 2019. Our net capital expenditures were €1.3 million for the month ended May 31, 2020, compared to €2.5 million for the month ended May 31, 2019. Our net operating cash flow was €29.3 million for the month ended May 31, 2020, compared to negative €6.2 million for the month ended May 31, 2019 with our sales for the third week of May 2020 being stable compared to sales for the same period last year. _June 2020_ Our revenue increased by 20.7% from €150.0 million for the month ended June 30, 2019, to approximately €181.0 million for the month ended June 30, 2020, and our organic revenue increased approximately 16.7% compared to the month ended June 30, 2019, as we have continued to benefit from the easing of the lockdown measures in our geographies. The increase in revenue for June 2020 is in line with the organic growth of our business prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. We also expect our Adjusted EBITDA margin for June 2020 to be meaningfully higher than our Adjusted EBITDA margin for June 2019 and our Adjusted EBITDA for June 2020 to be higher than our Adjusted EBITDA for June 2019. While it is too early to assess whether the economic downturn that is likely to follow the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material impact on our growth in 2020 and beyond, we believe we operate in a resilient market with strong fundamentals and structural trends that we expect will benefit us, such as the nondiscretionary nature of our services, an increasingly ageing car parc due to a significant drop in volumes of new car sales during the lockdown, additional opportunities for market consolidation due to the impact of the lockdown on smaller players and, as a result of the pandemic, the reluctance of the public to use public transport. During the lockdown, we also benefited from our increased online sales through our Oscaro platform and our Autossimo platform, whose sales grew by 42% in June 2020 compared to June 2019. We also believe that the IAM will continue to grow as mobility returns to normal levels and we will be able to capitalize on market shares gained during the lockdown, as a result of remaining open during the initial phase of the lockdown, to reinforce our position in Western Europe. We cannot predict, however, the degree to which, or the time period over which, our businesses will be affected by this pandemic and its impact on the economic conditions in the geographies in which we operate or a potential second outbreak of COVID-19 or of another communicable disease.

See “Principal shareholders.” (2) On the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering, to (i) fund the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes Redemption, (ii) fund the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes Redemption and (iii) pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing. See “Use of proceeds” and “—The Refinancing.” (3) Following the Refinancing on or about the Issue Date, €443.0 million of Existing 2016 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will remain outstanding under the Existing 2016 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and €138.0 million of Existing 2019 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will remain outstanding under the Existing 2019 Senior Secured Notes Indenture. 15 ----- (4) The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and future hedging obligations (if any), will rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and future hedging obligations (if any), that are secured by property and assets of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets. As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) by Parts Holding Europe S.A.S. (formerly Autodis Group S.A.S.) (the “Parent Guarantor”) and Autodistribution S.A.S. (the “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”). As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 30.3% of the consolidated total assets, 6.8% of the consolidated revenue and 25.3% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will also be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise reflect limitation under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the outstanding amount under existing proceeds loans, which is approximately €330 million and corresponds to the aggregate of the proceeds loan made available to on-lend the proceeds of prior issuances of Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes to the Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Corporate benefit, _financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of_ each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the _validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_ As of the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan will be secured by: (i) a first-priority pledge of the share capital of LuxCo 6 held by LuxCo 5; (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, material bank accounts and material intragroup receivables of the Parent Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings); (iv) first-priority security interests over certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A.S., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, its material bank accounts and its material intragroup receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A.S., (B) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material bank accounts and (C) Autodistribution S.A.S.’s material intragroup receivables. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” The security interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security _interests.”_ (5) The Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement provides for drawings of up to €100.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was fully drawn as of March 31, 2020, with €78.0 million of cash drawings and €22.0 million of guarantees. We expect the Revolving Credit Facility to remain fully drawn following completion of the Refinancing. See “Description of certain financing _arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_ On July 1, 2020, we entered into a €25.0 million government-backed PGE Loan in France in order to enhance our liquidity as a response to COVID-19. Drawing under the PGE Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the publication of a decision (arreˆte´ ministe´riel) by the French government to confirm the guarantee of the loan by the French State. We cannot guarantee that the French government will issue this arreˆte´ ministe´riel and that we will be able to draw on the PGE Loan. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—PGE Loan.” Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan are secured by security interests over, among other things, the Collateral. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, lenders under the PGE Loan and creditors of any future indebtedness incurred that is permitted to be incurred on a super senior basis under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement have been repaid in full. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes). The indebtedness of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the PGE Loan is guaranteed by, and is secured by certain assets of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee, and do not provide security in favor of, the Notes. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” (6) Certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 69.7% of the consolidated total assets, 93.2% of the consolidated revenue and 16 ----- 74.7% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. As of March 31, 2020, and after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor had approximately €245 million of debt outstanding (excluding bank overdrafts), of which approximately €156 million were incurred in connection with lease liabilities. See “Risk _factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.” In addition, certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes have_ entered into government-backed loans or loans with local commercial banks and increased certain existing lines of credit to strengthen our liquidity position in Italy (€5.0 million), Spain (€5.0 million), the Netherlands (€4.0 million) and Belgium (€7.5 million) in May and June 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We may enter into additional loans in other countries in which we operate, to the extent available. 17 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

If any such withholding or deduction is required by law, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay additional amounts so that the net amount received by holders of the Notes is no less than that which would have been received in the absence of such withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes— _Withholding taxes.” The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but_ not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, if, as a result of certain changes in tax law the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay additional amounts with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Redemption for taxation _reasons.”_ Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Issuer experiences a change of control, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of such repurchase. A change of control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of _control.”_ Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture. The Indenture will limit, among other things, the ability of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - create or permit to exist certain security interests; - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us; - transfer, lease or sell certain assets, including subsidiary stock; - merge or consolidate with other entities; - amend certain documents; and - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Each of these covenants is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured _Notes—Certain covenants” and the related definitions._ Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we achieve investment-grade ratings and following a qualifying initial public offering of the capital stock of any direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer.

The synergies reflected above primarily relate to: (i) purchasing synergies on supplier contracts negotiated by the Group, calculated on the basis of the volume of purchases for the relevant period, and signed rebate rates following the acquisitions as if the renegotiated contracts had been in place on the first day of such period; (ii) solely with respect to Oscaro, initiatives that we implemented as part of our turnaround plan with respect to Oscaro, including (a) the rationalization of non-core entities through the concentrating and shutting down non-core entities in non-core geographies and other normalization initiatives and (b) optimization measures (including supply chain optimization, call center rationalization, overhead cost savings and footprint optimization); and (iii) solely with respect to AD Bosch, purchasing synergies on contracts with suppliers of ISOTECH lubricants to the Group in order to replicate the better purchasing conditions of AD Bosch on lubricants or, alternatively, by sourcing lubricants directly from Spain. Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected synergies reflected above, no assurance can be given that such levels will be achieved or that additional unanticipated costs will not arise to achieve these synergies. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates, including those described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We may face challenges in integrating businesses that we have acquired or will acquire, 28 ----- _and in expanding into new markets and may be unable to realize the expected synergies and savings from these businesses or cost improvement initiatives we have taken.”_ (2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue and is calculated on a consolidated basis and by segment and Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin represents Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 as a percentage of revenue and is calculated on a consolidated basis and by segment.

Our light vehicle operations in France are serviced by three logistics platforms: (i) Logisteo, our automated warehouse, (ii) ACR, focused on key accounts and online customers and (iii) Cora, focused on light vehicle body parts for collision repair. Our light vehicle operations in Benelux, Italy and Spain are serviced by five logistics platforms: Doyen Auto and Geevers which cover Belgium and the Netherlands as well as certain online customers, OVAM/Ricauto and G-Group which cover Italy and AD Bosch which covers Spain. Our Trucks segment is serviced by one logistics platform called Bremstar. We rely on road transportation for the prompt transfer of the products that we distribute from our warehouses or distribution sites directly to our customers. A material disruption at any one of our warehouses or distribution sites or to our logistics platform or transportation network caused, for example, by fire, weather-related problems, outbreaks of contagious diseases, employee strikes, lock-outs and inadequacies in the transport infrastructure, or other events, could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner or at all, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any damages that may arise or to compensate us for any losses that we may incur, due to such interruption of our operations. We also rely, directly and indirectly, upon independent third-party logistics providers to ship to us most of our products from our suppliers and to transport products from our logistics platforms to our distribution network. Our use of any logistics provider is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which could increase our shipping and transportation costs. Strikes, work stoppages, mandatory quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures and inclement weather may impact such logistics providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our needs. If we change our arrangements with, or lose one of our important third-party logistics providers, we could face logistical difficulties that could materially adversely affect our operations and could cause us to incur significant costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the thirdparty logistics providers we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs. Since we distinguish ourselves on the basis of our superior delivery times (some of which are as short as a few hours), any material disruption that lengthens delivery times to our customers could strain our relationships with such customers and, as a result, may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. We are also exposed to an increase in transportation costs. In the year ended December 31, 2019, transportation costs accounted for 5.1% of our revenue. Transportation costs have historically fluctuated significantly over time, particularly in connection with oil prices. Increased transportation costs in turn could result in reduced profits. Any disruption in transportation services, or any increases in the cost of transportation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 30 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.2,"Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.","Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the outbreak of COVID-19 or other diseases, may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, leading to substantial declines in consumer purchasing power and resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products, our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and our operating results. In particular, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 17, 2020, the French government imposed a nationwide lockdown together with several other measures, which have had, among other things, a material adverse impact on the overall French economy and our results of operations and financial condition. As a result of these restrictive measures in France and in the other markets in which we operate, only a select number of our sites remained open during the initial phase of the lockdown while we maintained a limited number of employees in business-critical functions, and transitioned all of our eligible employees to remote working or to the French temporary unemployment scheme (chômage partiel). Even though the strict lockdown in France was lifted on May 11, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall French economy and, in turn, our operations. The full impact of the lockdown on the French economy is not yet known. Similar measures remain in place in the Benelux, Italy and Spain. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further materially impacted. We may also be unable to perform fully on our contracts and carry out new sales activity, and some of our costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, as a result of social distancing measures and restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our branded garages, Affiliated Distributors and customers may not be able to operate their businesses for a prolonged and indeterminate period of time, which would likely impact our operations. Additionally, it is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19, further waves of infection, or a renewed or extended lockdown, if materialized, will cause further disruption in our business operations, cause delay, or limit the ability of, garages, customers and suppliers to perform under their existing contracts, including making timely payments to us, and cause other unpredictable events. Customers may experience significant losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak and may terminate their existing contracts or postpone or ultimately cancel future planned orders and contracts due to those losses. Both domestic and international travel may be further restricted to certain areas which may limit our ability to obtain new customers and enter new markets, to provide services in the areas in which our customers are currently located or otherwise conduct our operations as we would do under normal circumstances. We are implementing enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules and guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the increase in costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result from any COVID-19 pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into contact with our operations. All or any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our activities have been, and may in the future be, disrupted by restrictions imposed by governments or other authorities to address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, or by changes in consumer behavior, which may result in a loss of consumers for us and our garages and Affiliated Distributors, and our future rate of growth may slow compared to the past. The general economic impacts of COVID-19 restrictions may result in consumers driving less often and therefore not using our garages or Digital B2C services and solutions or deciding to postpone, cancel or reduce spending on their vehicles. This could result in a reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could impact our liquidity, cash flow and financial condition. The disruptions triggered by COVID-19 in countries where our suppliers are located may also result in a slow-down of their production activities and other disruptions, any of which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In order to secure our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have entered into certain government-backed loans in Italy and Belgium and into loans with certain commercial banks in Spain and the Netherlands in May and June 2020. On July 1, 2020, we entered into the PGE Loan in France. Drawing under the 31 ----- PGE Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the publication of a decision (arreˆte´ _ministe´riel) by the French government to confirm the guarantee of the loan by the French State. We cannot_ guarantee that the French government will issue this arreˆte´ ministe´riel and that we will be able to draw on the PGE Loan. If the business disruptions caused by COVID-19 last longer than we expect, we may continue to seek other sources of liquidity, including additional government-backed loans in other countries in which we operate, to the extent available, but there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms and in amounts sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any deterioration in financial markets could impair our ability to obtain financing in the future, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness to operate our ongoing operations, fund liquidity needs or to refinance the Notes. The outlook for the world economy following the outbreak of COVID-19 remains subject to unprecedented uncertainty and such uncertainty may be prolonged in many of the markets in which we operate. The International Monetary Fund predicts negative global growth in 2020 and many national governments have instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. A renewed or future financial recession could lead to an adverse impact on demand for our products and on our results of operations. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 outbreak by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions, the French government and other governments of the countries in which we operate to contain the COVID-19 outbreak are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 outbreak will be contained. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects our business, results of operations and financial condition depends on several factors, such as the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, any additional periods of lockdown in the countries in which we operate, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and operating conditions will stabilize and recover in the countries where we operate, including France. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.",,as_expected,2020,482,

In 2019, we relied on approximately 260 third-party suppliers for the provision of light vehicle and truck spare parts, equipment and tools that are essential to our business. We are currently implementing a supplier concentration strategy by which we have rationalized our supplier relationships, reducing the number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260 in 2019, which allows us to negotiate with a smaller group of suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top ten suppliers accounted for approximately 50% of our products purchases by volume (as compared with 35% in the year ended December 31, 2010), and our top supplier accounted for 12% of our products by volume. Our business and, ultimately, our results of operations are dependent on our suppliers’ ability to provide us with products. Our suppliers may fail to meet delivery deadlines, provide us with sufficient products or comply with our quality requirements. The capacity of some of our suppliers to meet our supply requirements may in the future be constrained at various times and our suppliers may be susceptible to production difficulties, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs or other factors that negatively affect the quantity or quality of their production. Production by one or more suppliers could be disrupted due to a variety of factors, including closures of one of our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, terrorist attacks, financial distress or bankruptcy, as well as political upheaval, adverse economic events or logistical complications, shelter-in-place arrangements, facility closures, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of contagious diseases, border closures, delayed customs processing or other events. Any short-term or prolonged disruption in the supply of spare parts from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the event that one or more of our major 32 ----- suppliers experiences operational or financial difficulties and we are unable to secure alternative sources in a timely manner or on commercially beneficial terms, we may experience inventory shortages which could result in unfilled customer orders and lost revenues due to our “just-in-time” delivery method, as well as damage to our business reputation. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products under our presently agreed terms, or if we are unable to obtain products from our suppliers in the future at favorable prices, our margins will likely be negatively impacted and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if there is a significant or unexpected drop in customer demand or if there is a significant increase in customer demand that we are unable to meet from our “on-hand” inventory stock or procure in time from our suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. From time to time and in a limited number of cases, we have entered into agreements with, or provided services to, certain suppliers that may not necessarily be formalized in writing or otherwise and may enter into such agreements or provide such services in the future. In such circumstances, such suppliers could potentially demand higher prices or more stringent payment terms or may break off the agreement with limited notice and we may have no contractual remedy against such suppliers if we suffer economic loss as a result of their actions. Our ability to ensure continuity of supply from such suppliers might also be limited.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.4,"Our business is exposed to risks associated with economic and other conditions in the global economy and in particular in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain.","The demand for certain of the products that we distribute may be impacted by the condition of the global economy and in particular by economic conditions in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain. Global economic conditions have deteriorated over recent months due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The light vehicle spare parts aftermarket tends to be affected in the early period of an economic recession, when end-customers delay the maintenance of their light vehicles. The truck spare parts aftermarket is more cyclical than the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket, due to the correlation of the demand for road freight with general economic conditions. Simultaneously, de-stocking occurs at all levels of the spare parts supply chain, which may cause short- to medium-term decreases in sales by distributors of light vehicle and truck spare parts. France is our principal geographic market, representing 74% of our revenue and 77% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019. We also operate in Benelux, Italy and Spain and our Light Vehicle International segment represented 26% of our revenue and 23% of our Adjusted EBITDA over the same period. The outlook for the world economy remains subject to uncertainty, particularly in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead to prolonged periods of economic uncertainty in our main markets, especially France. See also “Any outbreak of severe communicable diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and _results of operations.” Such uncertainty could decrease consumer confidence and consumer and business_ expenditures on vehicle maintenance, or less frequent visits by our customers to our garages, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict the timing or duration of any economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in the geographies in which we operate. If the light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket significantly deteriorates due to economic conditions, we could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continued uncertainty in global economic conditions (particularly in the Eurozone) also poses a risk to our existing contractual arrangements and the fulfillment of obligations by us, our product suppliers or our customers. If the current economic situation deteriorates significantly or if one or more Eurozone countries were to depart from the euro, our business could be materially adversely impacted. We are also subject to the risk of increased costs due to general economic conditions, both in forms of increased employee costs and increased operational costs. Any failure to pass such increases in costs on to our customers could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our business and financial results may be adversely affected by factors and conditions that negatively affect the frequency with which our customers visit our garages, such as terrorism, social unrest, outbreaks of contagious diseases and political instability. We cannot accurately foresee the extent to which such events may affect our business, directly or indirectly, in the future and cannot assure investors that we will choose or be able to obtain insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts or certain other events and any losses that could result from these events. An actual or perceived terror threat, health emergency, social unrest or internal instability in France or in our other markets may negatively affect the frequency of our 33 ----- customers’ visits to our garages, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. Additionally, if there is a disruption at our warehouses (particularly at our key automated warehouse, Logisteo) or branded garages, an interruption in our supply and logistics chain and/or suppliers are unable to manufacture or deliver our products due to such catastrophic events, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",,as_expected,2020,482,

We may implement this strategy through organic growth, diversifying our activities or selected acquisitions, such as the recent acquisition of Oscaro and a majority stake in AD Bosch and future acquisitions in adjacent geographies. Acquisitions pose additional risks, including paying too high a purchase price, the assumption of unexpected liabilities and the impact of a change of control on the acquired business including with respect to contracts and financing agreements. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. In addition, the integration of an acquired business and our systems, operations and personnel, particularly in respect of businesses operating in adjacent markets, could be more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, which could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key employees and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated operating savings. Our failure to identify suitable acquisition opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business. In the near term, we also expect the impact of COVID-19, and our desire to manage our expenditures during the pandemic, to limit the number of acquisitions we make. Our logistics complexity will increase as our footprint grows. This increased complexity will require that we continue to expand and improve our capabilities, including our IT and other logistics management capabilities, as well as to grow, train and manage our employee base. We will also need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our information and distribution systems, controls and procedures related to financial reporting. Implementing new systems, controls and procedures and any changes to existing systems, controls and procedures could present challenges that we do not anticipate and which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, this increased complexity will require us to continually evaluate whether personnel with appropriate levels of expertise and experience are properly allocated in accordance with our growth strategy, and any failure to allocate such personnel may make it more difficult to achieve our growth strategy. Our growth could also make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will need to make in the future. This growth could impact the operational flexibility and reactivity of our supply chain and make us unable to react as promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends as we have been able to do historically. We may not be able to anticipate all of the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our business, personnel, systems, controls and procedures, and our failure to appropriately address such demands could materially adversely impact our existing operations and prevent us from implementing our growth strategy.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.6,"We may face challenges in integrating businesses that we have acquired or will acquire, and in expanding into new markets and may be unable to realize the expected synergies and savings from these businesses or cost improvement initiatives we have taken.","In the past, we have occasionally acquired businesses in order to expand our operations. For example, in 2018, we acquired a leading independent retailer of multi-brand car body parts in Benelux (Geevers), an independent spare parts distributor in Italy (G-Group), a multi-brand distributor of car body parts in Belgium (Verviers Freins) and an online distributor of light vehicle spare parts in France (Oscaro) and in 2019, we acquired a majority stake in an independent spare parts distributor in Spain (AD Bosch). We could face significant challenges in managing and integrating an acquired business into our business. The process of integration can be more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, leading to increased operating costs, the loss of key employees and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated synergies and operating savings, which can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses or any future potential acquisition within a reasonable time following our acquisition, we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits thereof. In connection with the integration of recently-acquired businesses or integrating any future potential 34 ----- acquisition into our existing operating structure, we will seek to realize purchasing and cost savings. For example, we often acquire targets, in part with the expectation that we would be able to integrate into our business the performance of their distribution networks, improve their operating results and realize purchasing and cost savings, particularly in the areas of procurement. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to fully integrate operations of past and future acquired businesses into our business, or at all, or that we will be in a position to realize some or all synergies and purchasing and cost savings when we acquire such targets. To achieve any of the foregoing, we could also be required to make additional capital expenditures which may be significant. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement these measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve the planned cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these projects proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned, and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the expected benefits from our cost measures. Furthermore, pricing pressure from our customers or competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the benefits of the cost measures that we have assumed that we will be able to implement. Also, cost efficiencies from expected improved logistics and distribution processes may not be sustainable due to changes in customer needs, environmental law, logistics, transportation costs or other cost variables. In addition, our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of key customers and suppliers. Our inability to realize the anticipated purchasing and cost savings and revenue enhancements from an acquisition and other measures that we have taken could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the future, we may acquire businesses or undertake investments or reorganizations in a targeted manner. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to identify suitable businesses or investment opportunities and be able to acquire, or make the investment, on favorable terms. There is also a risk that not all material risks in connection with the acquisition of a company or the making of investments have been identified in the due diligence process and may not, therefore, be taken into account when deciding whether to acquire the business or make the investment. These risks may materialize only after a company has been acquired or an investment has been made, and may not be covered by the warranties in the related agreements or by insurance policies. In addition, expansion into new markets, such as our expansion in the Spanish market through the acquisition of AD Bosch, entails greater risks than we face in our existing markets and such risks may be inherently higher if the expansion is made through acquisitions, due to the risks related to integrating acquired businesses. New markets may have different competitive and market conditions, customer preferences and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. In particular, expansion into new geographic markets exposes us to risks related to cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as risks related to navigating different legal and regulatory environments. We may also face a higher cost of entry, logistics difficulties and minimal operating experience in such territories. Our product and service offering may not be successful in new markets and our costs may increase due to cost overruns, unexpected delays or other unforeseen factors. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to integrate new locations (regardless of whether they are the result of organic growth or of acquisitions) into our network. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,482,

We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past due. There can be no assurance, however, that such reserves are sufficiently large for the credit risks we face, particularly in relation to our affiliated independent distributors. Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts would adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.8,Our industry is highly competitive.,"We operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from a variety of types of spare parts distributors and sellers in the highly fragmented Western European spare parts aftermarket, which comprises Benelux, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and does not include the UK. We primarily compete on the basis of 35 ----- product availability, delivery lead time, quality of service, product range and technical support. Our main competitors are other light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors in France (such as Groupauto), Benelux (such as LKQ) and Italy (such as LKQ), as well as new online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors (such as eurocarparts.com and autopm24.eu), which mainly compete with us on the basis of price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the internet before making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price. Over time, online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors may adopt our B2B distribution and logistics model, reduce costs and demand lower prices for the spare parts they sell. Furthermore, in certain countries, low-cost discount distributors have emerged that primarily compete on the basis of price and offer lower prices for the spare parts that they sell, and such low-cost discount distributors may decide to enter the French or one or more of our main markets. In addition, our competitors that currently purchase spare parts from suppliers on a decentralized basis may consolidate their purchasing functions across their various operations, subsidiaries or owned or Affiliated Distributors, and their purchasing scale may enable them to purchase spare parts at prices that are lower than we can obtain. As a result, they may be able to offer certain spare parts to customers at lower prices than we can. Our failure to adapt to these or other changes in the competitive landscape could result in a low profit margin, decreased revenue and loss of market share and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our customers also compete with spare parts suppliers and manufacturers (such as Bosch, Faurecia, KnorrBremse and Valeo) and branded spare parts manufacturers (such as Peugeot, Fiat, Volkswagen and Renault, including their affiliated dealers). Car dealers typically specialize in light vehicles and trucks aged zero to four years old and capture a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties. Certain car dealers, however, have extended their new light vehicle warranties to up to eight years, and provide for long-term service programs to customers. If light vehicle and truck manufacturers continue to significantly expand (for example, as a result of changes in the legal environment) the scope of their warranties beyond the current limits, especially for replacement parts and maintenance items, these replacements and maintenance parts covered by such extended warranties would likely be performed by car dealers instead of us. Additionally, car manufacturers such as Peugeot are increasingly relying on their own logistics platforms to distribute light vehicle and truck spare parts even outside the usual warranty periods and for all vehicle brands and types, which could reduce our market share in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may face more intense competition in the future if competitors adopt aggressive pricing policies, expand their distribution networks, undertake more extensive marketing and advertising campaigns, offer more appealing products or adapt more quickly to changes in customer preferences and trends. We may also face competition from generalist online players entering or already present on the spare parts distribution business. Certain of our competitors may possess greater financial resources, newer or better technology and materials, larger purchasing economies of scale and/or lower cost bases, integrated manufacturing capabilities, stronger name recognition and/or entrenched relationships with suppliers, any of which may give them a competitive advantage over us and could result in a loss of our market share.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.9,"Our sales depend on the age, condition, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks used in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain and the length of service intervals.","The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by the age, condition, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks used in France and other markets in which we operate, and the length of service intervals in those markets. We consider our core market to be light vehicles and trucks aged over four years. As light vehicles and trucks get older, expenses for light vehicle and truck spare parts generally increase. A decline in the age of light vehicles and trucks could lead to decreased demand for the products that we distribute and our services. A decline in the use of light vehicles could result in a related decrease in demand for light vehicle spare parts. Factors such as higher gasoline prices or gasoline taxes, a significant deterioration in economic conditions, environmental concerns or limitations on tax breaks for commuting costs and the introduction of a road charge for light vehicles and trucks and potential speed limits and certain vehicle bans in cities could reduce light vehicle and truck spending. Similarly, changes in traveling or commuting behavior (for example, through the increased use of public transport or light vehicle sharing) or continuing urbanization could decrease the average mileage of light vehicles and demand for the products that we distribute and our services. Such a decline in demand could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 36 ----- The condition of vehicles could also impact demand for our products and services, with lower-quality vehicles requiring more frequent and more costly maintenance and repairs, while more expensive vehicles may require more expensive replacement parts. The size of the car parc or truck fleet is also a demand driver. The number of vehicles in use is a function of new vehicle sales and vehicle scrappage rates and a steady or growing total vehicle population supports continued demand for maintenance and repair. Finally, average annual mileage of vehicles in the car parc or truck fleet impacts demand for our products and services because higher mileage, like vehicle age, increases the need for maintenance and replacement. A decrease in the average age of the car parc or truck fleet, driven by increased purchases of new light vehicles and trucks, could lead to decreased demand in the short-term for our products and services, although such purchases would also increase the size of the car parc or truck fleet, potentially stimulating demand for our products and services on the mid- to long-term. For example, the French government is currently developing incentives for drivers that are intended to phase out older, polluting vehicles. The outcomes of these efforts are not yet known but could lead in the short-term to decreases in the size of the older car parc if drivers choose to scrap older vehicles and replace them with new vehicles. Likewise, a decline in the number of, or mileage on, light vehicles and trucks and in our addressable spare parts aftermarket could lead to decreased demand for the products that we distribute and our services. We believe that light vehicle and truck repairs are currently being made at a later date and to a lesser extent. The technological and qualitative improvements of many light vehicle and truck components can lead to a decrease in demand for light vehicle and truck spare parts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,482,

If orders and inventory do not efficiently match demand at any particular time and location, either in terms of the quantity or nature of products, we could have higher or lower than anticipated inventory levels, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results. For example, if products remain unsold, we may need to reduce selling prices, resulting in lower margins, or may need to incur higher charges to store inventory or transport it to other markets within our network where there may be greater demand. We may also be required to incur further inventory depreciation. Conversely, if we fail to stock sufficient quantities of high- selling products or cannot provide in-demand services, we could lose sales and our reputation with customers could be damaged. Furthermore, we may not be able to appropriately respond to the preferences of customers in markets outside France, our original market, where customers could have different needs than French customers. If we are unable to appropriately align our inventory and services with consumer demand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The various software we use and develop in collaboration with third-party software companies facilitates our ability to efficiently manage supply flows, operational data and other management and financial information, and to provide management with current inventory levels at our warehouses. In particular, our customized IT systems allow us to identify, in real time, the availability of any particular product that is ordered within our distribution network. We depend on the continuous availability and reliability of our IT platform, which, in turn, depends on the functioning of our IT hardware and is, therefore, subject to operational risks such as the occurrence of equipment failures, power interruptions and unlawful conduct by third parties. The performance of our IT systems also depends, among other things, on our ability to effectively safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage from interruptions to telecommunication services, data breaches (including breaches that result in the theft or compromise of customer data), hacking and phishing attempts and the introduction of malware and computer viruses. The occurrence of any such events, and any consequent slowdown or interruption to telecommunication services, may impair our ability to manage supply flows, operational data and other management and financial information and to provide management with current inventory levels at our warehouse, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 37 ----- For example, we have upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage our inventory more efficiently. The upgrade of our existing IT systems or the implementation of new IT systems may cause organizational disruptions within our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new warehouse IT management system, or any future IT systems, will deliver the projected efficiencies. One of our strategies is to increase sales of products that we distribute through our websites. The implementation of this strategy will require additional IT resources and may result in a disruption to our existing computer and telecommunications systems, whether in connection with the implementation of expanded capabilities or otherwise, which could, in turn, adversely affect our online sales and/or our business reputation. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain and upgrade our IT systems in a manner that will avoid interruptions or disruptions of such systems.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.13,Continued technological advancements in light vehicle and truck parts could affect our sales.,"The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by technological and qualitative improvements in new light vehicles and trucks, and the light vehicle and truck market is characterized by frequent technical advances, automation and increases in the complexity of existing components. Certain light vehicle and truck spare parts may feature complex or innovative technology that can only be maintained by persons with special training or at specialized garages. Our success depends in large part on our ability to access, follow, interpret and react to changing technological and qualitative specifications in an appropriate and timely manner. Our products and services must be adapted to the technological needs of a broad range of customers, which may not be foreseeable with certainty and are subject to change. In order to efficiently develop our products and services, we need to access new and detailed information on new light vehicles and trucks provided by light vehicle and truck manufacturers. If such manufacturers were to refuse to provide appropriate and timely access to such information, or if a new regulation were to limit access to such information, we would be unable to efficiently develop our products and services, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. New light vehicle technology may also require continuous training and regular updating in relation to a particular light vehicle or truck model. For example, repairs of sensors as well as repairs of air conditioning systems require special skills, training and equipment. The independent garages that are the primary end-users of the parts we distribute may not continue to obtain the information and training necessary to maintain the complex technology featured in our end-customers’ vehicles, and the expertise to install and repair these parts may only be available at car dealers. Moreover, the expenses required for specialized staff training as well as the sophisticated equipment required to test and repair these evolving components could result in higher costs or higher capital expenditure for us or for our end-customers. In certain cases, it may no longer be economically feasible for independent garages to offer repair services for particular light vehicle and truck models or spare parts. Furthermore, sophisticated manufacturing technology for light vehicle and truck spare parts improves their quality and reduces the number of replacements and repairs they require. If light vehicle and truck spare parts are replaced less frequently, our revenue could decrease. The IAM in which we operate differs from the OEM, in which operators are linked to the light vehicle manufacturers who directly supply them with the necessary technical information on vehicle components and repair procedures. Due to ongoing technological developments in the manufacturing of light vehicles and trucks, independent garages need to develop appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components. The failure of independent garages to develop the appropriate technical expertise, or access to the tools, instruments and 38 ----- parts that such technological developments demand, may result in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by car dealers with the necessary technical expertise (which garages represent a small portion of our revenues), which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.14,Our business depends in part on a strong brand image and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand or market our product offerings we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers or sell sufficient quantities of the products that we distribute.,"We believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands are integral to the success of our business and to the implementation of our growth strategy. This will require us to make further investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as our website operations. For example, we have developed websites for each of our distributors and garages and we invest in large customer events, such as an event to develop our brand that we organized in September 2018. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, and our ability to provide good customer experiences. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Our brand image may also be diminished if we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient delivery of quality products, if we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we distributed products to approximately 3,673 branded garages and 84 distributors, including 31 wholly-owned distributors and 53 Affiliated Distributors. We have entered into a master affiliation agreement with all of our affiliated independent distributors, which is renewed every seven years, and we enter into agreements with each of our light vehicle branded garages, which are renewed annually. These branded garages and affiliated independent distributors, which we do not control, may take actions or make decisions that adversely affect our brand and reputation. Our principal brand names and trademarks, such as Autodistribution, Doyen, Garage Expert AD, Mondial Pare-Brise, Auto Primo, Autossimo, Truckissimo, AD Poids Lourds and ISOTECH, the “AD” logo, and since the Doyen Auto Acquisition, 1,2,3 AutoService, Requal and API, and since the acquisitions of G-Group and Oscaro, the Xenergy and Oscaro brands, respectively, are key assets of our business.

However, there is no assurance that third parties will not infringe our intellectual property rights in the future in ways that will have negative repercussions on our reputation, business and results of operations or that measures taken by us will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights. In the event that third parties unlawfully infringe on our intellectual property rights, we may face considerable difficulties and costly litigation in order to fully protect our intellectual property rights, which may in turn materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and prospects. Third parties have in the past and may in the future assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business to include new products and product categories and moves into other geographic markets. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert management attention. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability and prevent us from distributing certain products or employing certain brand names and trademarks. In addition, the resolution of claims may require us to abandon or redesign our products or branding materials, acquire license rights from third parties or cease using those rights altogether, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent any violation or challenges to our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that litigation will not be necessary in order to enforce our trademark or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves against third-party claims of infringement of their rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brands and trademarks, which could, in turn, lead to decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 39 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

In order to optimize our real estate portfolio and respond to changes in demographics or other conditions at specific locations, we may seek to exit certain leases at regular intervals and obtain new leases in new locations that provide similar flexibility. Our ability to negotiate lease terminations or modifications on acceptable terms or at all may be limited. For example, in France, commercial leases generally provide for a minimum nine-year term, with breakpoints at the end of each threeyear period, and include strict termination and renewal provisions, including the possibility of a rent increase if the lease is renewed after the initial nine-year term. If we are unable to terminate the leases of locations that are no longer consistent with our strategy, we may incur expenses in relation to the termination of such leases. In addition, third-party landlords may also seek to terminate certain of our leases, which may require us to relocate some of our operations.

In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French tax code (Code général des impôts) (the “French Tax Code”), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset taxable profits with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of the taxable profit exceeding €1 million. Similar rules apply to tax losses generated by French tax consolidated groups. As of December 31, 2019, we had recorded tax loss carry-forwards notably in France. The French tax loss carry-forwards have been reflected in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in the amount of €101.8 million of deferred tax assets corresponding to the portion of tax loss carry-forwards that we expect to offset against operating profits in the following fiscal years.

Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs, union membership levels and activity among our employees and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. Likewise, maintaining good relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result, a failure to meet our labor needs or any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Business—Employees.” Some of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other things, the general working conditions of our employees such as maximum working hours, holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and incentives. National collective bargaining agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions that could affect our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees. We may not be able to extend existing company-specific agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or in their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, such as our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from January 1, 2020. The ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules apply since January 1, 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance _Law for 2019”). The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) (the “French Finance Law for 2020”) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed_ the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Tax Code. See “Risk factors— _Risks related to our business—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on this rule._ In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities might ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It is expected to be implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and consolidation being put in place swiftly afterwards. Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Finally, political responses to the economic consequences of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic may include increases in taxes or implementation of new taxes in various jurisdictions. 46 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

The EU List was established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the Council of the European Union during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions. The Black List, which shall be updated at least once a year, is currently (according to the list as of February 18, 2020) composed of twelve jurisdictions (American Samoa, Cayman Islands, Fiji, Guam, Oman, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States Virgin Islands and Vanuatu). Furthermore, the Council published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order to comply with the European Union screening criteria. Though there is no applicable sanction yet, Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions. A French law that aims at fighting against tax fraud was published on October 24, 2018 (Law 2018-898 of October 23, 2018) and has expanded under certain conditions the French tax regime regarding non-cooperative states or territories (États ou territoires non coopératifs) as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (“Non-Cooperative States”) to certain states and jurisdictions included in the Black List. As a result, interest paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in certain states and jurisdictions included in the Black List or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such states and jurisdictions may be subject to withholding tax in France and not be deductible for purposes of the computation of the debtor’s corporate income tax liability. The anti-abuse measures apply to states and jurisdictions newly added to the list, in principle, as from the first day of the third month following the month during which the addition is made (although the Administrative Guidelines (as defined hereinafter) still continue to refer to January 1 of the following year (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211)), it being mentioned that the French list has recently been updated and includes the states and jurisdictions contained in the former version of the Black List dated November 7, 2019 (Ministerial Order dated January 6, 2020 amending the ministerial order dated February 12, _2010).

Any changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our reported results and financial condition. In particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB. For example, on January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases) and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes 47 ----- an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay rental expenses. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. We have applied IFRS 16 since January 1, 2019, its mandatory application date. The implementation of IFRS 16 resulted in an increase in total assets at January 1, 2019 of €170.2 million, in total liabilities of €171.4 million and a positive impact on Adjusted EBITDA of €47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to this new standard, the IASB may in the future adopt further changes or additions to IFRS, which we may be obligated to adopt and the impact of which would be initially uncertain. In June 2017, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting treatment of uncertainties in income taxes, specifically in relation to taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12. IFRIC 23 states that an entity should assume that the applicable taxation authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information when examining amounts reported to it. An entity therefore has to consider whether it is probable that the applicable authority will accept a certain tax treatment in the entity’s income tax filing and either adopt an approach consistent with the tax treatment in its income tax filings or use the expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates. IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. In adopting IFRIC 23, we applied a modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRIC 23, if any, should be recognized in opening equity at the date of initial application. As part of our adoption of IFRIC 23, we have identified an additional €0.8 million of additional deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2019.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor as a direct or indirect shareholder of such subsidiaries. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Parent Guarantor will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - the creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries would have had total debt of approximately €245 million (excluding bank overdrafts), of which approximately €156 million would have been incurred in connection with lease liabilities, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

See “Capitalization.” Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations, including, but not limited to: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater financial resources than we have; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and industry; - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors; - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

In relation to such implementation, (i) the provisions of (x) Articles 212 bis and 223 B bis of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former 25% general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses (“rabot fiscal”)) and (y) Article 209-IX of the French Tax Code (the “Amendement Carrez” limitation) have been repealed and (ii) the provisions of Article 212-II of the French Tax Code (i.e., existing thin-capitalization rules) have been amended, as developed in more detail below. The other rules limiting interest deductibility generally remained unchanged, in particular the rules relating to the maximum deductible tax rate for interest paid to direct minority shareholders or to related parties (Articles 39.1.3° and 212-I-(a) of the French Tax Code). Under Article 39.1.3° of the French Tax Code, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.32% with respect to fiscal years closed on December 31, 2019). Non-deductible interest pursuant to such limitation will be treated as deemed dividend under French tax law and may in particular be subject to withholding tax, subject to applicable tax treaties. By exception, Article 212, I-(a) of the French Tax Code provides that, in respect of a given tax year, interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. 52 ----- Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both relatedparty and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount. French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5x the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. Nevertheless, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group (as determined under accounting consolidation rules) to which it belongs is higher than its own debt-to-equity ratio. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carryforward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year might also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-equity ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer’s tax consolidated group (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer from any related party) and at level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 includes specific provisions which implement into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which are applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which would be applicable as from January 1, 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the French tax Code (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. 53 ----- Articles 205 B et seq. of the French tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without _inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both_ the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if the deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. The new provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent in its country of establishment but the jurisdiction of its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly an aggregate of more than 50% of the voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit, qualify the entity as non-transparent. In this situation, the entity would be treated as taxable in its jurisdiction of establishment (either at the level of the entity or at the level of its shareholders or partners). The above-mentioned tax rules may limit the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries’ ability to deduct interest accrued on the group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",,as_expected,2020,482,

However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate._ The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The mechanism by which the tax would apply and be collected is not yet known, but if the proposed directive or any similar tax is adopted, transactions in the Notes would be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished. Under the 2013 proposals, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State, or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and/or certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If the proposed directive or any similar taxes are adopted, such taxes could increase the transaction costs associated with the purchases and sales of the Notes and could reduce liquidity in the market for the Notes.

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or the acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and other indebtedness. Furthermore, the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its respective subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such an event. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise, established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. The court may also in certain circumstances void the security interest or the Guarantees where the debtor is close to or near insolvency. In France, among other limitations, the granting of new security interests in the Collateral in connection with the Notes issued is subject to hardening periods, where certain arrangements or disposals that are made during the “hardening period” (période suspecte) (period running from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it) may be challenged by the receiver in bankruptcy and certain creditors under applicable rules of avoidance. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests in the Collateral will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. The Indenture will permit the security interests in the Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart the applicable hardening period. If any security interest granted during the hardening period for debts previously incurred were sought to be enforced, it would be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain _insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings.”_ In addition, in France, insolvency legislation tends to favor the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors. In the context of proceedings affecting creditors, including courtassisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc) proceedings or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation), and court-administered proceedings (safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde _financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation_ proceedings (liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes or the Guarantees could be limited or suspended. Under French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by the Issuer, a Guarantor or any relevant security provider, as the case may be, may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under French law, as the case may be, in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest. For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Issuer, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations _on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_ In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ or the Luxembourg Security Providers’ jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

The directors, managers, officers and other executives of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are neither residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, most of the assets of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers or directors, managers, officers and other executives of the 57 ----- Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The United States is not party to a treaty with France or Luxembourg providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France or Luxembourg. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France or Luxembourg of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French or Luxembourg court is satisfied that certain conditions have been met.

Such recoveries and enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility. The Security Agent is required to pay turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions to discharge obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan or future hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness in priority to paying any such amounts to discharge the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guarantees, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan or future hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral or the enforcement of the Guarantees will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the PGE Loan and such hedging obligations and, if applicable future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain restrictions with respect to the use of proceeds from the sale of assets representing the Collateral prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement—Maturity _and repayment requirements.”_ Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of the judicial 58 ----- foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte _commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the_ legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The Indenture will also permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of (i) creditors holding more than 66.67% of the indebtedness and commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain other indebtedness permitted to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral (a “Credit Facility”) and the certain priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging 59 ----- obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Notes/Pari passu Required Holders”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of such enforcement instructions first being issued or if Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued or certain insolvency events occur and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles. Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders may at any time (if the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)) provide immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/ _Pari passu Required Holders determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could_ reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles. If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event that is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received Proposed Enforcement Instructions (as defined herein) from the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders until such time as a creditor representative acting on behalf of Majority Super Senior Creditors issues enforcement instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such prior instructions given by the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari passu Required Holders. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the creditors of any other credit facility and the creditors in respect of certain priority hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents and other security interests over the Collateral at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its holding companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_ Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents or other transaction security, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default.

The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among others, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located, the availability of buyers and whether approvals required to purchase the business would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the holders of the pledges securing the Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such distribution with respect to the Notes. The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes, and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and/or the Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties have liens on the Collateral, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral. Although we will be subject, under the Indenture, to certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness that will be secured by the Collateral, including a Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio contained in the Indenture (as defined and described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants— _Limitation on Indebtedness”), the definition of Senior Secured Indebtedness contained in the Indenture or the_ purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio contained in the Indenture contains certain important exceptions and carve-outs.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes,13.2.21,The security over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Notes.,"The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes but have been granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide, and the Intercreditor Agreement provides that only the Security Agent and Parallel Debt (as defined below) creditors have the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. 61 ----- Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code which came into force on 1st October 2017. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee will have certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following defaults or events of default, and acts in the interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour _de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011_ n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, among others, the Trustee. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee.

In addition, in the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, whether as a result of the creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in certain circumstances, linked to our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture may require, subject to local law limitations, such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees against third parties.

Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined in “Tax considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any.

The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. On May 25, 2020, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. downgraded the rating of the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes from B3 to Caa1.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined herein) will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. 65 ----- Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream.

The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.

Such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are a leading aftermarket light vehicle spare parts distributor and truck spare parts distributor and repairer in Western Europe, mainly active in France, Benelux, Italy and Spain, with over 55 years of experience. Since the acquisition of Oscaro in November 2018, we have become an “omni-channel” (online and offline) distributor in the business-to-business (“B2B”), business-to-consumer (“do it yourself”) (“B2C (DIY)”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) segments. We hold strong regional positions in favorable markets, supported by our unique operational model and value-added services proposition, our history of organic growth and valueaccretive acquisition-led growth as well as our strong financial profile. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, we generated revenue of €1,782.9 million, an Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of €197.8 million and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €219.9 million. We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France, with the largest independent single-branded distribution network and 29% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018, and in the truck IAM in France, with the largest independent distribution network and 18% market share (in terms of revenue) in 2018. We also hold leading positions around the rest of Western Europe and, in 2018, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM distributor in both Belgium and Italy (21% and 4% market share, respectively), the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands (5% market share). We entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the acquisition of 75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, a leading B2B distributor in Catalonia with approximately 27 sites as of December 2019, and a member of AD Parts, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain, with 30% market share in 2018.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting our results of operations,17.2.1,Factors related to our industry,"_Dynamics of the aftermarkets for spare parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair_ The following factors may affect the distribution aftermarkets in which we operate in any given period: - **Size of the car parc/truck fleet. The number of light vehicles and trucks on the road impacts the size of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles and trucks. The size of the car parc in Western Europe has grown steadily in recent years and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 0.1% between 2018 and 2025. Growth of the car parc is impacted by population size, the rate at which new cars are introduced into circulation and the rate at which old cars are retired from the road. The size of the truck fleet in France, our primary truck market, has remained more or less flat in recent years and is expected to grow slightly between 2019 and 2023. Growth of the truck fleet is impacted by the same factors as those impacting the car parc, plus general economic factors which may result in an increase or decrease 71 ----- in the number of new registrations as a function of demand for commercial shipping (which tends to increase during times of economic growth and decrease during times of economic difficulty). - **Age and quality of the car parc/truck fleet. The average age of light vehicles and trucks in operation also has an impact on the distribution aftermarkets in which we operate. In the EU, the average age of the light vehicle car parc has increased from approximately 9.6 years in 2011 to 10.5 years in 2019, a trend which is expected to continue. In France, our largest market, the average age of the light vehicle car parc has increased from approximately 8.0 years in 2007 to 9 years in 2019, and is expected to increase to 9.3 years by 2030. In general, older vehicles require more repair and maintenance services and spare parts than younger ones, and as a result, an increase in the age of the car parc and truck fleet is expected to have a positive impact on our operations. The age of the car parc and truck fleet is impacted by the sales price and production quality of new light vehicles and trucks because both high sales prices and increasing production quality (which generally enables vehicles to run longer without repair or replacement) generally lead owners and truck fleet managers to delay the purchase of new light vehicles and trucks, respectively, which could lead to decreased demand in the short term for our products and services, although such purchases would also increase the size of the car parc or truck fleet, potentially stimulating demand for our products and services in the medium- to long-term. Additionally, regulations may continue to evolve in connection with gas emissions, which may lead to upgrades to the car parc overall. - **Miles travelled. Vehicles that are frequently used and driven for longer distances typically require more repair and maintenance services and replacement of spare parts than those that have traveled less. The average annual mileage for light vehicles is structurally resilient, with limited or no impact from economic downturns. General economic conditions impact mileage, and government incentives that encourage carpooling and the use of public transportation may also reduce miles travelled. The fleet mileage for trucks in France is also expected to grow, mainly driven by the recovery in Europe of the manufacturing and construction sectors and associated transportation needs. - **Job frequency. Our results are impacted by the frequency with which drivers and truck fleet operators seek repairs on their vehicles or require replacement parts. Higher job frequency benefits us because it increases demand for the products that we distribute and the services we provide. A number of factors affect job frequency. As the car parc and truck fleet age, the need for repairs and/or maintenance increases, thus increasing job frequency. Likewise, increased average mileage of the car parc and truck fleet tends to also translate into greater job frequency as parts reach the end of their useful lives sooner. Finally, general economic conditions can also impact job frequency, as during an economic downturn, drivers or truck fleet managers may postpone non-essential vehicle repairs and maintenance due to their diminished spending power. - **Preference for independent garages over manufacturers’ dealers’ garages. We believe that the diminished spending power of consumers and the increasing age of the car parc and truck fleet have encouraged drivers and truck fleet managers to rely more on garages operating in the independent segment, as opposed to the manufacturers’ dealers’ segment. On average, the IAM provides more competitive pricing than the OES. Certain customers prefer, however, particularly during the warranty coverage period, to have their light vehicle serviced in a manufacturer’s dealer’s garage, due to the link between the manufacturers’ dealers’ garage and the original light vehicle manufacturer, despite current EU regulations that allow customers to use independent garages without impacting their warranty. Manufacturers’ dealers’ garages tend to use original vehicle manufacturer parts that generally have higher prices than those offered by us. - **Diversity of the car parc. There are many brands and models of vehicles on the road in our geographic markets, each of which requires specific spare parts for repairs. Any increase in the variety of spare parts would benefit large, integrated distributors such as us because we have the scale to stock a wide variety of spare parts. As a result, we can serve as a one-stop-shop for our end-customers, who increasingly require a wider range of products. This increase in brands and models of vehicles may adversely affect manufacturers’ dealers’ distributors, which focus on single brands, and small-scale IAM distributors, which are less able to offer a wide variety of spare parts. An increase in the variety of brands and models of vehicles may lead to further consolidation among smaller IAM distributors, thereby further benefiting established, large and integrated distributors such as us. The factors described above have generally had a positive impact on our results for the periods under review, and we believe have generally increased our ability to maintain stable earnings and cash flow. 72 ----- _Technological trends in our industry_ Our results are impacted by evolving technical specifications and new technologies in our industry and our ability to timely respond to such trends. Technological advancements in the light vehicle and truck market, such as the increasing number of driver assistance systems, collision prevention systems, control devices and other electronic components, have resulted in more complex and more expensive repair processes and related spare parts. The increased use of technology in the manufacturing of light vehicles, trucks and their respective spare parts has improved the quality and extended the lifespan of key light vehicle and truck components, such as exhaust systems, tires, and brakes. These trends have adversely affected our operations in certain of our business segments because light vehicle and truck spare parts tend to wear out less frequently, which in turn lengthens maintenance service cycles, lowers job frequency and leads to lower demand for spare parts and repair services. Furthermore, due to ongoing technological developments, independent garages need to acquire the appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components and gain access to the training, tools, instruments and parts that such technological developments demand. Failure by independent garages to do so may result in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by manufacturers’ dealers’ garages with the necessary technical expertise. Similarly, given the extended lifespan of spare parts, certain truck and light vehicle manufacturers have extended their new warranties (in the case of light vehicles to eight years or more, as compared to four to five years in the past) and provide long-term service programs to customers. Nevertheless, in many cases, decreasing volumes have been offset by increased prices for technologically advanced spare parts and complex repair services. In addition, certain technological advancements may require entire modules or systems to be replaced in certain types of light vehicles, as opposed to discrete parts, thereby increasing replacement costs and decreasing market shares for small garages. _Competition_ We face competition in our markets from two principal types of market participants: OE distributors and other IAM distributors. The OE segment typically specializes in light vehicles and trucks from newly-purchased to three-year-old vehicles, and captures a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties, as well as a more limited share of repairs of light vehicles and trucks aged four years and older. Certain vehicle manufacturers have, however, extended their new light vehicles warranties to up to eight years and now cover longer-term maintenance and repairs. We also face direct competition from other IAM distributors, particularly on the basis of operational efficiency and price. We also compete against online light vehicle and truck spare parts retailers that mainly compete with us on the basis of price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the Internet before making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price. We realized at an early stage that the Internet offered innovative opportunities for light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors. In order to take advantage of these opportunities, we acquired Oscaro in November 2018, the French leader in online sales of light vehicle spare parts. Oscaro is one of the first online players to offer new spare parts from manufacturers and wholesalers, generating the majority of its revenue from the B2C (DIY) segment. _General economic conditions_ Our business and the demand for certain products that we distribute are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. While our business and the IAM in Western Europe as a whole have generally proven resilient during economic cycles, each of our business lines responds differently to general economic conditions. Our light vehicle business line tends to demonstrate resilience during weaker general economic conditions, as light vehicle owners switch to cheaper independent garages from manufacturers’ dealers’ garages and the average age of the car parc increases, increasing demand for maintenance. This provides our business with an element of counter-cyclicality, in spite of vehicle owners delaying repairs for a short period of time. Our truck parts distribution business line shows a higher correlation with general economic cycles, with miles driven by trucks, and therefore demand for truck parts, increasing as general economic conditions improve. Our collision repair business tends not to be significantly affected by general economic cycles. In addition, certain of our products, such as brake pads, belts and other critical parts, tend to exhibit inelastic demand, even during difficult economic conditions, while more discretionary items, such as accessories for light vehicles and trucks, tend to be impacted more by the economic climate, for example during COVID-19. 73 ----- _Regulation_ The market for the supply and distribution of spare parts is affected by regulatory changes in each of the geographies in which we operate, including those that govern access to the spare parts aftermarket for IAM distributors and those that seek to impact vehicle safety and other driver behaviors. - **Block Exemption Regulation: The market for the supply and distribution of light vehicle and truck spare parts and the provision of repair and maintenance services has been generally liberalized as a result of EU regulations. Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 dated May 27, 2010 was adopted to promote fair and effective competition among aftermarket players, vehicle manufacturers and authorized repairers, by ensuring that aftermarket players have access to spare parts and technical information relating to such spare parts. The current regulatory framework (valid through to May 2023) is favorable for IAM players such as us because it provides for: (i) full access for independent light vehicle and truck spare parts manufacturers and garages to the technical information needed to ensure effective competition within and between the IAM and the OE aftermarket, (ii) customers’ rights to engage independent garages throughout the life of the light vehicle with no warranty limitations, (iii) the unrestricted sale of light vehicle and truck spare parts in the IAM and (iv) resellers’ rights to use private brands and logos for light vehicle and truck spare parts sales. - **Traffic laws and policy: The overall market for collision repair in France has been affected by a decline in collisions as a result of the increased enforcement of and publicity surrounding traffic laws. We have, however, increased our market share in this declining market by strengthening our relationships with car insurance companies, providing collision parts at lower prices and improving our supply chain for the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision repair. Likewise, regulations applicable to trucks are particularly stringent and apply high standards for truck safety through periodic technical controls. - **CICE: In addition, our results are also impacted by government policies in France relating to payments for certain social charges, such as CICE. In December 2012, CICE, a tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs, was adopted as part of an overall stated French government policy to improve the competitive position of companies in France. However, Article 86 of the French Finance Law for 2018 (law 2017-1837 of December 30, 2017) abolished the CICE for salaries paid as from January 1, 2019. Another concurrently enacted law (law 2017-1836 of December 30, 2017) partly balanced the elimination of the CICE by decreasing, under certain conditions, by one point the rate of one of the employer’s social security contributions as from January 1, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, however, we have not identified a significant impact. See “Risk factors—Risks _related to our business—Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and employment, and changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” for further information._",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting our results of operations,17.2.2,Factors specific to our business,"_Operational improvement measures_ Our results are affected by operational improvement measures that we implement. We have developed and continue to implement operating strategies designed to enhance profits. One of our most important competitive advantages has been our ability to use the purchasing power we have derived from our large size and our fully-integrated, automated warehouse and logistics systems. In recent years, we have strategically reduced the number of suppliers we use, concentrating larger volumes of purchases among fewer suppliers, which has enabled our CPU to negotiate better purchasing terms and conditions for the products that we distribute. We have also streamlined our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and distribution network to get products to our customers increasingly rapidly and cost effectively. As a result of these measures, we have significantly improved our cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations from €103.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €109.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We intend to continue optimizing purchase conditions with our key suppliers. In addition, we intend to continue to integrate our upstream supply chain to increase our margins. _Distribution network and branded garages_ Our local distribution model includes wholly-owned distributors and independent affiliated distributors. We had 31 wholly-owned distributors as of December 31, 2019. Conversions of wholly-owned distributors to 74 ----- independent affiliated distributors, and vice-versa, may have an impact on our profitability and, in addition, overhead costs are higher for administering the wholly-owned network of distributors as compared with the network of independent affiliated distributors. Additionally, if our network of distributors, including both wholly-owned and independent affiliated distributors, were to shrink or expand, our revenue could be impacted. Similarly, many of our customers are garages, some of which are branded garages. We had entered into agreements with 3,673 branded garages as of December 31, 2019. Turnover in and maintenance or extension of our network of branded garages also has an impact on revenue. For example, if our network of branded garages were to shrink, we might generate lower revenue as a result. On the other hand, if our network of branded garages were to expand, it might generate higher revenue.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting our results of operations,17.2.3,Key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations,"_COVID-19_ Our operating performance is subject to global economic and market conditions, including their impact on the global automotive industry. Although it is at this stage too early to predict the medium- to long-term effects of the pandemic on the markets in which we operate, the COVID-19 outbreak impacted our operational and financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the month ended January 31, 2020, our sales increased by approximately 2.4% compared to the month ended January 31, 2019, and for the month ended February 29, 2020, our sales increased by approximately 5.8% compared to the month ended February 28, 2019. Our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately €12.9 million for the month ended January 31, 2020, and approximately €11.6 million for the month ended February 29, 2020. Our revenue reached €320.7 million (and €310.4 million excluding AD Bosch) for the two months ended February 29, 2020 as compared to €298.5 million for the two months ended February 28, 2019 (representing an organic growth of approximately 3.9% and an actual growth of approximately 7.3%), Adjusted EBITDA reached €24.5 million (and €23.4 million excluding AD Bosch) for the two months ended February 29, 2020 as compared to €20.1 million for the two months ended February 28, 2019 (representing an organic growth of approximately 15.9% and actual growth of approximately 21.6%) and a growth of approximately 6% in our Light Vehicle France for the two months ended February 29, 2020 as compared to the two months ended February 28, 2019. Our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA declined sharply in the second half of March 2020 and in April 2020 as a result of the lockdown measures implemented in the markets in which we operate. Despite the sharp drop in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, we outperformed the market in terms of the trough in our performance during the lockdown (with a decline of 60% compared to a decline of 80% for the market in the last week of March 2020) and the pace of recovery, as we were less impacted than the market every single week of the lockdown. Our revenue for the month ended March 31, 2020, decreased by 26.4% organically, compared to the month ended March 31, 2019. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operations in March 2020 limits the comparability of our results for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. See “Recent Developments—COVID-19 pandemic and recovery” for additional information on the measures we implemented following the outbreak and our financial recovery in May and June 2020. _Acquisitions and disposals_ We have historically pursued external growth through acquisitions in the past and intend to continue to seek opportunities for acquisitions in the future. During the periods under review, we have successfully acquired a number of businesses that are complementary to our existing operations, including: - On March 22, 2017, we acquired Mondial Pare-Brise, a French windshield repair specialist, and a stake in Grup Eina, a Spanish company specialized in offering digital technical support and data management for vehicle repairmen; - In 2017, we formed a joint company, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., with three distributors of light vehicle spare parts, OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto, making it the number two light vehicle spare part distributor in Italy. Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. is a holding company and is a joint venture with certain managers of OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car. We hold 55% of the share capital and voting rights of Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. and a call option for further shares of Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., which may only be exercised starting from May 2020 and at a pre-agreed, fixed EBITDA acquisition multiple; 75 ----- - On March 1, 2018, we acquired additional interests in Sarco, increasing our ownership from 49% to 100%; - On March 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Société Française d’Industrie Automobile (“SFIA”), a wholesale and retail light vehicle distributor in Epernay, in eastern France; - On May 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in GPR Auto, a wholesale and retail light vehicle distributor in southern France; - On May 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Geevers, an independent distributor of light vehicle spare parts in Benelux; - On May 31, 2018, OVAM acquired 100% interests in FGL Srl, an Italian distributor specialized in car body parts and lightning; - On June 19, 2018, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l. acquired 100% interests in G-Group, an independent spare parts distributor in Italy; - On July 31, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Vallespir Auto Diffusion S.à r.l., a wholesale and retail vehicle spare parts distributor in southern France; - On October 1, 2018, we acquired 100% interests in Loire Pare-Brise a windshield repair specialist a subsidiary of Mondial Pare-Brise in France; - On October 31, 2018, Doyen Auto Belgium S.A. acquired 100% interests in Verviers Freins, a multibrand distributor of mechanical parts, bodywork, paint, tools and garage equipment in Belgium; - On November 13, 2018, we acquired a 82.49% interest in Oscaro, the leading online seller of light vehicle spare parts in France; - On August 5, 2019, we acquired a 75% interest in AD Bosch, the leading parts distributor in Catalonia; - On September 30, 2019, General Auto, acquired 100% interests in Team Ricambi Srl, a wholesaler specialized in light vehicle and truck spare parts, and industrial components based in Italy; - On September 30, 2019, Geevers acquired 100% interests in Loek Autoparts B.V., a distributor of collision repair parts in the Netherlands; - On October 4, 2019, Truck & Car Services acquired 100% interests in Maillot Pièces Poids Lourds, a distributor in Eastern France; and - On December 12, 2019, we acquired an additional 0.10% interest in AD Bosch and we hold a 75.1% stake in AD Bosch since that date. Furthermore, in 2017, we decided to exit the Polish market by divesting our Polish subsidiary, AD Polska, to Rhiag Group. Following the disposal of AD Polska, it was classified as discontinued operations. In our consolidated income statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, AD Polska’s net result is shown in the caption “Discontinued Operations.” In our consolidated cash flow statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, AD Polska’s cash flows from operations, investing and financing activities are shown in separate lines as discontinued operations. These acquisitions have affected our results and limit the comparability of our results from period to period. These acquisitions as well as potential future acquisitions and disposals will continue to impact our results. By further participating in the industry-wide consolidation of our markets and integrating acquired entities into the Group, we believe that we can increase the purchasing power of our CPUs to negotiate better contractual terms with suppliers, thereby improving our margins. We believe we are well positioned to be a natural consolidator in the fragmented markets in which we operate, and we intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions to further expand our network in order to increase our market share and purchasing power, as well as, realize other economies of scale. _Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 9—Financial instruments_ We adopted IFRS 9 on January 1, 2018, prospectively. The comparative periods presented have not been restated to reflect the potential impact. Under IFRS 9, we applied the simplified approach permitted thereby, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized at the initial recognition of the receivables. For receivables of our major customers, a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses is recognized based on each 76 ----- customer’s credit ratings. For other receivables, a portfolio approach is applied to the extent they have similar credit risk characteristics and provision is recognized according to certain criteria based on days past due of the receivables and actual historical default rates. The impact of the first adoption of IFRS 9 on our consolidated statement of financial position as of January 1, 2018, is described in note 4.1.2 to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16—Leases_ On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. We adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which has an impact on our reported consolidated assets, liabilities, income statement and cash flow statement. We prepared our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which comparative results are not restated. On transition, for leases previously accounted for as operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months and for leases of low-value assets, we have applied the optional exemptions to not recognize right-of-use assets but to account for the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. For those leases previously classified as finance leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the date of initial application at the same amounts as under IAS 17 immediately before the date of initial application. Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 (which were prepared after the first application of IFRS 16) are limited in comparability to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 (which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16). The implementation of IFRS 16 resulted in an increase in total assets of €170.2 million and in total liabilities of €171.4 million, in each case as of January 1, 2019, and a rental costs impact on Adjusted EBITDA of €47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over income tax treatments_ In June 2017, the IFRS Interpretation Committee issued IFRIC 23, which clarifies the accounting treatment of uncertainties in income taxes, specifically in relation to taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12. IFRIC 23 states that an entity should assume that the applicable taxation authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information when examining amounts reported to it. An entity therefore has to consider whether it is probable that the applicable authority will accept a certain tax treatment in the entity’s income tax filing and either adopt an approach consistent with the tax treatment in its income tax filings or use the expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit or loss, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates. IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. In adopting IFRIC 23, we applied a modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRIC 23, if any, should be recognized in opening equity at the date of initial application. As part of our adoption of IFRIC 23, we have identified an additional €0.8 million of additional deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2019.",,as_expected,2020,482,

An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset. Revenue can be broken down as follows: - _Sales revenue through our logistics platforms: We distribute spare parts for light vehicles and trucks, based on a highly sophisticated distribution system that requires significant investments in logistics. - _Direct flow sales commission: We also sell spare parts, equipment and tools that are delivered directly by suppliers to independent distributors and do not pass through our logistics platforms. When such third-party suppliers other than us are involved in providing goods to a customer, we assess whether the nature of our promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods itself 77 ----- or to arrange for the suppliers to provide those goods or services. We are considered an agent if our performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods by the suppliers and revenue is recognized for the amount of any commission to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for arranging for suppliers to provide our goods. The commission revenue recognized corresponds to the difference between the consideration received from the customer less the consideration due to the supplier that provided the goods. Where direct delivery is made by suppliers to independent distributors, we are invoiced by suppliers and then invoice such distributors. Related payment flows are processed by us.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The Benelux body parts activity remained stable given that the Netherlands did not implement a strict lockdown. - Digital B2C: Digital B2C revenue decreased by €2.0 million, or 3.1%, from €65.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to €63.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in sales of €3.6 million in March 2020 following the COVID-19 outbreak. This decrease was partly offset by the lower impact of lockdown in France on this segment. _Cost of goods sold_ Cost of goods sold decreased by €9.6 million, or 3.6%, from €263.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to €254.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a reduction in the volume of sales and purchases in March 2020 following the COVID-19 outbreak. Cost of goods sold increased by 4.7 % between the two months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, which is in line with the sales increase. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold remained stable at 58.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and 58.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €1.0 million, or 1.1%, from €89.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to €90.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the integration of AD Bosch. As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs increased from 19.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to 20.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the effect of the acquisition of AD Bosch, which had a higher personnel cost base than the Group’s average personnel cost base for the three months ended March 31, 2020. _External expenses_ External expenses decreased by €2.5 million, or 4.5%, from €55.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to €52.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to lower expenses and other fees, such as legal fees, which decreased by €2.9 million as a result of the one-off expenses incurred in connection with the plan we implemented in 2019 with respect to the integration of Oscaro. As a percentage of revenue, external expenses decreased from 12.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to 12.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the effect of the acquisition of AD Bosch, which had lower external expenses than the Group’s average. _Taxes other than income taxes_ Taxes other than income taxes increased by €0.6 million, or 10.9%, from €5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to €6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. _Other operating income and expenses_ Other operating income and expenses decreased by €0.4 million from an expense of €0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, to an expense of €0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 82 ----- _Depreciation and amortization expenses_ The table below sets out our depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019.",,as_expected,2020,482,

As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from 55.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 57.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This slight increase as a percentage of revenue was mainly due to a time lag in realizing purchasing synergies from the recent acquisitions and the lower gross margins from the recently acquired Italian businesses (taking into account the full-period impact from acquisitions completed in 2017 and the contribution of acquisitions completed in 2018), partly offset by the fullyear impact of Mondial Pare-Brise’s purchasing synergies. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €30.9 million, or 11.2%, from €276.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €306.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the integration of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, Mondial Pare-Brise, G-Group, Geevers and Oscaro. As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs decreased from 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 20.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to (i) our productivity improvements; and (ii) the effect of the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto and G-Group in Italy, which have a lower personnel cost base than the Group’s average. _External expenses_ External expenses increased by €27.6 million, or 16.6%, from €166.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €193.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to (i) higher advertising expenses, which increased by €4.7 million between the relevant periods due to one-off expenses related to a large-scale AD network conference held in September 2018 and (ii) higher transportation costs, which increased by €9.6 million, between the relevant periods, as a result of higher activity, increasing fuel costs and increasing cost of the transportation service companies. 90 ----- As a percentage of revenue, external expenses remained stable, representing 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to (i) the effect of the acquisition of OVAM, Topcar, Ricauto, and G-Group in Italy as well as Geevers, which have a lower external expense cost base than the Group’s average; and (ii) our efforts to monitor and control external costs. _Taxes other than income taxes_ Taxes other than income taxes increased by €0.2 million, or 1.8%, from €11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Other operating income and expenses_ Other operating income and expenses decreased by €2.4 million, or 43.6%, from an income of €5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to an income of €3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Depreciation and amortization expenses_ The table below sets out our depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The Adjusted EBITDA margin of the Light Vehicle International segment increased from 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to purchasing synergies. - Digital B2C: The Adjusted EBITDA of the Digital B2C segment was €(6.1) million, as a result of the acquisition of Oscaro. - Headquarters: The Adjusted EBITDA of our Headquarters function decreased by €0.5 million, or 4.2%, from €(11.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €(12.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to our decision to strengthen our central functions to support our development. _Other income from operations_ Other income from operations increased by €0.1 million, 14.3%, from €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 92 ----- _Other expenses from operations_ Other expenses from operations increased by €2.0 million, from €13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to (i) €7.9 million costs related to our then contemplated initial public offering, including financial consulting costs as incurred up to date; and (ii) an increase in IT transformation costs, from €1.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 to €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was partly offset by (i) the one-off expense related to the implementation of the new Logisteo platform in Réau for the year ended December 31, 2017, which amounted to €3.7 million, and (ii) the one-off expense in 2017, related to the provision for retirement costs, due to the harmonization of the collective employment agreement for all the employees of the Group. _Net financial results_",,as_expected,2020,482,

For the year ended December 31, 2018, income taxes comprised CVAE of €5.4 million (compared to €5.6 million in for the year ended December 31, 2017), a current income tax expense of €4.2 million (compared to a €3.9 million current income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017) and a deferred tax expense of €2.9 million (compared to a deferred tax benefit of €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017). _Net income from discontinued operations_ Net income from discontinued operations decreased by €28.9 million, from €32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to €3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and relates to AD Polska. _Net income_ As a result of the factors described above, our net income decreased by €27.6 million, or 88.2%, from a net income of €31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, to a net income of €3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.",,as_expected,2020,482,

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.50,Liquidity and capital resources,17.50.2,,"Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, operating losses, acquisitions, and contractual obligations and commitments. Our principal sources of liquidity have been our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, factoring facilities, bank overdraft facilities and finance leases. We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, debt securities (including the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and the Notes offered hereby), any borrowings under our working capital and bank overdraft facilities, including our Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan, factoring facilities and finance leases. We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 93 ----- Our financial condition and liquidity have been, and are expected to continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors, including: - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations; - the level of our outstanding indebtedness, and the interest we are obligated to pay on such indebtedness, which affect our finance costs; - prevailing interest rates, which affect our debt service requirements; - our ability to continue to borrow funds from banks; - our level of acquisition activity - our capital expenditure requirements; and - the medium- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our cash requirements are expected to consist mainly of the following: - paying operating costs and working capital; - funding capital expenditures; - funding potential acquisitions; - servicing indebtedness; and - paying taxes. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, future borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE Loan and potential future borrowings under debt securities will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt when due, such as the Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes. In addition, there is a significant increase in economic uncertainty due to the impact of COVID-19, which already impacted our results for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and may impact our financial condition and our ability to raise financing in the future. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—Any outbreak of severe communicable _diseases, including COVID-19, may materially affect our business and results of operations.”_ If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to _generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_",,as_expected,2020,482,

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €115.6 million, or 26.5% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a favorable change in working capital of €79.8 million mainly driven by an increase in trade payables as a result of an extension of the payment terms with certain large suppliers. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €35.3 million, or 7.8% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a favorable change in working capital of €4.1 million offset by income taxes of €5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €110.1 million, or 6.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and includes the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019, which increased depreciation and amortization expenses by €44.5 million and decreased rental expenses by €47.6 million, compared to what the net cash from operating activities from continuing operations would have been before the adoption of IFRS 16. Excluding the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16, net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily driven by the unfavorable change in working capital of €41.8 million due an increase in inventories mainly in connection with the build-up of stock by Doyen Auto to supply Autodoc. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €58.9 million, or 4.0% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an unfavorable change in working capital of €30.9 million due to an increase in inventories, mainly at our Logisteo platform. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to €103.2 million, or 8.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to favorable changes in working capital due to a decrease of receivables as a result of the new non-recourse factoring program that allows factored receivables to be deconsolidated, which were partly offset by an increase in inventories due to business acquisitions during the year and higher year-end activity to fulfill the end-of-year rebates. 95 ----- _Net cash flow used in investing activities_ The following table sets forth the components of our net cash flows from investing activities for the periods indicated.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Cash flow used in investing activities relates to (i) capital expenditure, which consists of the acquisitions of non-current assets, and (ii) the acquisitions of business, net of cash acquired. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of €8.4 million driven by capital expenditures of €8.2 million. See “—Capital Expenditures.” For the three months ended March 31, 2019, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of €8.6 million driven by capital expenditures of €8.4 million. See “—Capital Expenditures.” For the year ended December 31, 2019, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of €91.0 million driven by new business acquisitions of €51.8 million and capital expenditures of €40 million, partly offset by a cash inflow from disposal of assets of €2.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of €201.3 million driven by new business acquisitions of €163.4 million, mainly due to the acquisition of Oscaro customer relationship asset (€4.8 million) and brand (€50.6 million), and capital expenditures of €32.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of €84.2 million driven by new business acquisitions of €67.1 million, mainly due to the acquisition of the Autodistribution Belux customer relationship asset (€10.0 million), and capital expenditures of €28.0 million. _Capital Expenditures_ Our capital expenditures consist solely of the acquisition and maintenance of non-current assets. Our capital expenditures include the further expansion of our operations and the maintenance of our existing operations. In particular, our capital expenditure on tangible assets mainly relates to purchases of shelving and machinery for the transport and storage of products in our warehouses, as well as purchases of commercial delivery vans that we use in our operations. Our capital expenditure on intangible assets mainly relates to the capitalization of new functional development costs of our “Enterprise Resource Planning” software, the purchase of software licenses relating to management and financial reporting, technical light vehicle and truck databases and inventory management. Capital expenditures decreased by €0.2 million, to €8.2 million, or 1.9% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, from €8.4 million, or 1.9% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in investments following the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. Capital expenditures increased by €7.2 million, to €40.0 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019, from €32.8 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due the integration of capitalized development costs from Oscaro for €3.0 million and €1.5 million of investment in Mondial Pare-Brise. Capital expenditures increased by €4.8 million, to €32.8 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, from €28.0 million, or 2.2% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily 96 ----- due to the increase in maintenance capital expenditures following the acquisition of OVAM, Ricauto, Topcar and Mondial Pare-Brise, partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to the automated Logisteo platform finalized and launched in 2017. Although we intend to continue to make investments on maintenance and development of our existing business, we intend to take a conservative approach with respect to capital expenditures for the year 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the countries in which we operate. _Business acquisitions_ Business acquisitions mainly relate to external acquisitions. The amount of the acquisition is presented net of cash (or overdraft) held by such acquired entity. There was no business acquisition for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €51.8 million, or 2.9% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to the acquisition of 75% interests in AD Bosch for a purchase price of €48.1 million in August 2019. Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €163.4 million, or 11.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to the acquisitions of (i) 82.49% of the capital stock of Oscaro, the leader in online sales of light vehicle spare parts in France, for an amount of €91.3 million in November 2018; (ii) 100% of the capital stock of G-Group for an amount of €15.8 million in May 2018, which enabled us to enter the Central and Southern Italian market and to strengthen our number two position in the Italian market; and (iii) 100% of the capital stock of Geevers, the leading independent retailer of multi-brand car body parts in Benelux, for a purchase price of €50.2 million in May 2018. Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €67.1 million, or 5.3% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we made four acquisitions: (i) in March 2017 we purchased 100% of the capital stock of Mondial Pare-Brise for an amount of €35.8 million, which aims to create purchasing and logistics synergies with Cora’s windscreen business; (ii) in March 2017 we purchased 100% of the capital stock of four truck distributor companies for an aggregate purchase price of €1.3 million; (iii) in May 2017, we purchased 55% of the capital stock of three leading Italian distributor companies, who are leading stockiest distributors in northern and central Italy, for an amount of €29.2 million; and (iv) in May 2017 Doyen Auto purchased 100% of the capital stock of two auto parts distributors for an aggregate amount of €4.6 million. During the same period, we disposed of 100% of AD Polska for €13.3 million, net of cash transferred, as well as 100% of APS Berwald (ten sites in Moselle) for €4.2 million. _Cash flow from (used in) financing activities_ The following table sets forth the components of our net cash flows from financing activities for the periods indicated:",,as_expected,2020,482,

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.1,Overview of the Western European light vehicle IAM,"The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket generated a total revenue of approximately €27.4 billion in 2018. From 2018 to 2025, the overall Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.4% to €30.1 billion, driven by further organic growth and consolidation opportunities. The Western European light vehicle IAM is a large and growing channel of the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket, and tends to be resilient, predictable and fragmented, presenting significant opportunities for consolidation, with high visibility into the future addressable market through operational excellence and economies of scale. From 2018 to 2025, the overall Western European light vehicle IAM is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.9% to €18.6 billion. The graphic below shows market sizes as of 2018 and growth forecasts for the 2018 to 2025 period for the light vehicle distribution core aftermarkets and IAMs in each of the countries where we operate, as well as certain adjacent geographies. The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is expected to grow between 1% and 3% in all geographies shown over the 2018 to 2025 period, with growth in the IAMs forecast to exceed or be on par with such growth in each country over the same period. Between 2014 and 2018, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket grew at a CAGR of 1.9%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc (as defined below), while the Western European light vehicle IAM gained market share and grew more quickly, at a CAGR of 2.5%, further driven by ageing of a growing number of cars on the road (the “car parc”). The graphic below shows the historical and estimated future split of market value and market share between OE car dealer networks and IAM distributors in the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket for the periods shown. The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket tends to be structurally resilient, stemming from the fact that, even when new car sales fluctuate, the installed car parc requires ongoing repair and maintenance, which, generally, favors the aftermarket and, particularly, the price-competitive IAM. In addition, 104 ----- automotive technological evolutions contribute to the resilience of the aftermarket by supporting its growth in value. As an example of this resilience, the graphic below compares the size of the car parc, new light vehicle sales and the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket in France for the periods shown. The French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is largely uncorrelated to the new light vehicle sales or economic cycles as it serves a large and steadily-growing installed car parc. For instance, even when new light vehicle sales in France declined, the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket showed stable growth. The Western European light vehicle IAM has a high and reliable level of visibility into the future addressable market, due to the fact that its target market is cars aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a result, IAM distributors are able to project the car parc that will be serviceable in five years since the size of the car parc, the vehicle types and the installed technology, are already known from the stage of production. Moreover, the Western European light vehicle IAM steadily and structurally grows in Europe gaining market share over OE car dealer networks. Such growth benefits the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket through the market of aged cars, the flexible and broad multi-brand network coverage and the growing technical expertise. 105 ----- Finally, the European light vehicle IAM is highly fragmented. In 2018, the top ten players held 17% of market share (in terms of revenue), in contrast with the U.S. light vehicle spare parts market, in which the top ten players (in terms of revenue) held 78% of market share.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The truck spare parts distribution and repair core market in France is a mature market that exhibits more cyclicality than the Western European light vehicle spare parts distribution market. The graphic below shows the split between the OE truck dealer networks, IAM networks and Integrated workshops in the truck spare parts distribution and repair core market in France in 2018, including market sizes and growth forecasts for the 2018 to 2025 period and for the 2025 to 2030 period. As shown above, IAM held approximately 18% market share of the overall truck spare parts distribution and repair market in France in 2018. The IAM’s share of the truck spare parts distribution and repair market in France is expected to grow slightly through 2030. The truck IAM in France is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.3% over the 2018 to 2030 period. This growth is compounded with forecasted fleet age decreasing to 2025 as a result of the recovery of new registrations post 2015, followed by an increase in fleet age beyond 2025 to 2030, as well as an increased technical complexity of trucks. This impacts the capacity of integrated workshops to perform in-house maintenance and leads to a loss of shares on certain complex operations while positively affects impacting the extensions of maintenance contracts and guarantees.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The online market is projected to grow in Western Europe, driven primarily by an increase of online penetration and proactive expansion by large industry players. The key drivers to online penetration are the following: the development of an offer driven market, the overall country internet access, the e-commerce maturity, and the appeal for DIY/DIFM. The different levels of professionalism across B2B (concept workshops and independent workshops) and B2C (DIY Mechanics/ Hobbyists, Consumer/Amateur, DIFM) customers also drive differences in online purchasing behavior. Less complex and more basic parts or consumables generally have the highest degree of online penetration due to the highest product confidence and ease of installation. The competitors in online spare-parts distributors are generally categorized in three groups: Broad-based online specialists (such as Oscaro, Mister-Auto and Autodoc), marketplaces (such as Cdiscount, eBay and Amazon) and tire specialists. 106 ----- The graphic below details the current and forecasted market growth and dynamics of key Western European countries.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.4,,"The Western European light vehicle spare parts market comprises of three main components: (1) the manufacturing and supply of spare parts by parts manufacturers (“original equipment suppliers” or “OES”) (such as Bosch, Faurecia, Knorr-Bremse and Valeo) and the supply of branded spare parts by car manufacturers (“car manufacturers” or “OEM”) (such as Fiat, Peugeot, Renault and VW) who are in turn supplied with spare parts by the OES; (2) the distribution of spare parts by OE car dealer networks and IAM distributors; and (3) retail sales and service to drivers by garages, independent repairers, autocenters, tire specialists and fast fitters, as well as retail locations (such as spare parts outlets and scrap yards) and online players. We are a distributor in the IAM of the European light vehicle spare parts market and do not act directly as a repairer in this market. Our role as a distributor remains crucial due to the specificities of this market being positioned as a market leading distributor with integrated and controlled value chain management. The graphic below shows the flow of light vehicle spare parts from suppliers, through aftermarket distributors to retail and service center customers and finally to drivers. We also operate in the IAM of the truck spare parts market in France. Like the Western European light vehicle spare parts market, the truck spare parts distribution and repair market in France comprises of three main components: (1) the manufacturing and supply of spare parts by OEM (such as Bosch, Mahle, ZF Aftermarket and Wabco) and the supply of branded spare parts by OEM (such as DAF, Iveco, Krone, Man, Mercedes Benz, Renault Trucks and Schmitz) who are in turn supplied with spare parts by the OEM; (2) the distribution of spare parts by OE truck dealer networks, IAM networks and integrated workshops; and (3) the maintenance and repair by garages, certified repairers or agents, and integrated workshops. We act as both a distributor and a maintenance and repair service provider in the IAM of the truck spare parts market in France. 102 ----- The graphic below shows the flow of truck spare parts from suppliers, through the OE truck dealer networks, IAM networks and integrated workshops to retail and service center customers and finally to owners and operators of truck fleets. Light vehicle and truck spare part manufacturing is characterized by a high level of part complexity and density. Due to the number of vehicle variants in the market and the multiplicity of pieces per vehicle (8,000 per car on average), spare parts manufacturers collectively produce several million SKUs. OE car and truck dealer networks primarily source spare parts from specific OEMs and OESs, while IAM distributors mainly employ a less expensive, multi-brand sourcing approach. Light vehicle and truck spare parts and products can be grouped as follows: - repair and maintenance, such as radiators, alternators, steering and suspension components, brake systems, spark plugs, oil filters; - body parts, such as hoods, bumpers, doors, wings, glass, paints; - repairer equipment, such as diagnostic tools; and - oil, tires, consumables and accessories, such as antifreeze, coolant, in-car entertainment, navigation systems. The Western European light vehicle aftermarket distributes spare parts to garages, certified repairers, autocenters, tire specialists, fast fitters, retailers and web dealers. _Garages generally may repair cars from all brands with IAM spare parts and may be “independent” or_ “affiliated” with a brand. Affiliated garages include AD-branded garages, Bosch Car Service, Eurorepar and Top Garage. _Certified repairers operate under an OEM banner, such as Renault, Peugeot, VW or Fiat. Autocenters are generally self-service shops located near supermarkets. Norauto and Feu Vert are examples_ of autocenters. _Tire specialists’ principal activity is tire sales and changing. Euromaster and Eurotyre are examples of tire_ specialists. _Fast fitters are focused on quick service, focused on tires and maintenance. Speedy and Midas are examples_ of fast fitters. _Retailers include spare parts outlets, supermarkets, scrap yards and gas stations, such as Total. Web dealers can be split into three categories: pure-player specialists (such as Oscaro and Mister Auto),_ online tire specialists (such as Allopneus) and, to a lesser extent, e-commerce generalists (such as eBay and Amazon). 103 ----- The truck aftermarket in France also distributes spare parts to garages, certified repairers or agents and integrated workshops.

The French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is large and mature, with revenue of €5.8 billion in 2018, and is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 1.0% over the 2018 to 2025 period, reaching €6.2 billion in 2025. This represents similar growth to the 2014 to 2018 period (1.2% CAGR). Growth of the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket through 2025 is expected to be supported by car parc growth (forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.4% from 2018 to 2025, from 38 million units in 2018 to 39 million units in 2025), car parc ageing, increase in average car mileage and spare parts price increases. When vehicles get older and fall outside of the OEM warranty period, customers tend to shift to IAMs, who generally provide more affordable services. IAM garages benefit from increased expertise and professionalization from distributors, who contribute to an overall increase in quality of service through specialized training and technical support. The light vehicle IAM in France generated revenue of €3.6 billion in 2018 and is growing at a more dynamic pace (forecast CAGR of 1.6% over the 2018 to 2025 period) than both French light vehicle OE car dealer networks (forecast CAGR of 0.2% over the 2018 to 2025 period) and the French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket (forecast CAGR of 1.0% over the 2018 to 2025 period). In 2018, the light vehicle IAM in France held 62% of market share, which is expected to increase at a slightly lower pace to 65% by 2025, driven by the car parc’s ageing positively impacting IAM volumes, attractiveness of multi-brand positioning for distribution dealers, garages and consumers and potential regulatory evolution with regard to the liberalization of captive parts.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,Market drivers and growth potential,18.6.2,,"There are four key market drivers in the Western European light vehicle IAM and the truck IAM in France: - _Size of the parc/fleet, which refers to the total number of light vehicles or trucks in operation and which is driven primarily by new light vehicle or truck sales; - _Age of the parc/fleet, which refers to the average age of light vehicles or trucks in operation and which is driven by the frequency with which older light vehicles or trucks are replaced with new light vehicles or trucks; - _Prices for spare parts, which is driven primarily by increasing complexity and sophistication of parts and systems; and 107 ----- - _Job frequency, which refers to the frequency with which repairs and replacement parts are needed, which is in turn connected to the number of accidents, the increasing reliability of vehicles and to average mileage. For further information on the size and age of the car parc, see “Industry—Overview of the Western _European light vehicle IAM.”_ In addition, we benefit from a favorable regulatory environment, which is characterized by deregulation of captive parts pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) 461/2010 and Commission Regulation (EU) No 330/2010, EU-level initiatives that favor the transition to low- and zero-emission vehicles pursuant to the Paris agreement, increasingly strict French regulation on technical inspections of vehicles as well as potential future regulatory developments that may favor autonomous vehicles. Deregulation of captive parts is expected to occur in 2020. The liberalization of the captive parts will have a favorable effect on the IAM distributors, enabling them to address more vehicles aged nine years and under. A transition to low- or zero emission vehicles, as well as the rollout of autonomous vehicles, both of which could positively impact IAM distributors by increasing the frequency and number of compulsory testing for vehicles in order to meet various emissions standards as well as contributing to a more general trend whereby more complex, “new generation” vehicles drive higher parts prices, as discussed above.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Our strengths,18.11.1,"Leader in the resilient, predictable and structurally growing Western European market","We are the market leader in the light vehicle IAM in France (29% market share in 2018 in terms of revenue) and we hold leading positions around Western Europe (based on a study commissioned by us in 2019). In 2018, we were the second largest light vehicle IAM distributor in both Belgium and Italy and the fourth largest light vehicle IAM distributor in the Netherlands and we entered the Spanish light vehicle IAM with the acquisition of 75.1% of AD Bosch in 2019, the leading light vehicle IAM distributor in Catalonia, Spain. We operate in the Western European light vehicle distribution “core” aftermarket that is structurally resilient in the face of 111 ----- macroeconomic factors that impact the broader automotive industry and distribution markets. While new car sales tend to fluctuate with economic cycles, the light vehicle distribution core aftermarket benefits from a steadily growing installed car parc and the recurring need for maintenance and repairs to be made to the existing car parc, irrespective of downturns in the economy. New car sales only account for a small portion of the overall car parc. Approximately 2.6 million new cars were sold in France in 2018, compared with a car parc of approximately 38 million cars in total. Moreover, in economic downturns customers generally favor IAM distributors, such as us, over OE distributors due to longer car ownership, as new car sales decrease, as well as increased price-sensitivity. For example, after a sharp decline at the end of March and beginning of April 2020, the French light vehicle spare parts market showed resilience and a significant recovery at the beginning of May 2020, also due to a generalized decline in the use public transport as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which favored car usage. The IAMs in which we operate show particular strength and growth potential due to two long-term market dynamics: a stable, slightly increasing Western European car parc and an increase in average vehicle age which are expected to drive growth in the number of cars that need service by light vehicle IAM distributors like us in the coming years. Between 2014 and 2018, the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket grew at a CAGR of 1.9%, driven in part by an increase in the size of the car parc, while the Western European light vehicle IAM grew more quickly and gained market share, at a CAGR of 2.9%. The French light vehicle distribution core aftermarket revenues and light vehicle IAM revenues are forecast to grow by 1% and 1.6% over the 2018 to 2025 period. The Western European light vehicle IAM is also expected to continue outperforming both the broader market and its OE car dealer network competitors in the 2018 to 2025 period. The existing car parc’s age and mileage increase due to growing mobility needs, including car sharing or long-term leasing, and increasing the need for maintenance and repair. In France, the average mileage per passenger vehicle has grown steadily by approximately 1% per year over the 2011-2016 period. We believe that we will be well positioned to take advantage of this evolution of mobility as distributors associated with a large garage network, such as us, are expected to be partners of choice of fleet managers. Light vehicle IAM distributors also have the benefit of a high level of visibility in terms of the future addressable market of cars needing service and repair. The addressable market for the light vehicle IAM is cars aged over five years. Generally, cars aged under five years are covered by warranty and maintenance contracts and are predominantly serviced by OE car dealer networks. As a result, we can project the size and composition of the car parc that will require service in the five to ten-year range because car parc size, vehicle types and installed technology are known from the point of production. We generally service cars over a long period of time (from five to twenty years), which may require multiple repairs and parts replacements over their lifespan. We distribute parts for cars that span the entire car parc, covering a wide range of makes and models, giving us a wider addressable market compared to our OE car dealer network competitors who generally distribute parts for cars from just one manufacturer.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Our strengths,18.11.2,Well-known light vehicle and truck spare parts distributor with critical scale in a fragmented Western European market,"In addition to the Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket being highly attractive, economies of scale favor larger distributors such as ourselves. Extensive logistics, technology and network investments are necessary to service a broad and fragmented customer base seeking the supply of several million SKUs for rapid and continuous delivery and the difficulty in building sufficient brand awareness and long-term relationships with suppliers that are necessary to negotiate competitive pricing. As a result, suppliers can secure more business when going through us to distribute their products as they can access a wide range of customers, and therefore they also benefit from our scale. The necessary investments to deliver economies of scale in our market also present a barrier to entry to competitors in a currently fragmented market. The Western European light vehicle distribution core aftermarket is fragmented with the top 10 players in Europe representing approximately 17% of the market in 2018, which also provides significant potential for consolidation, giving an edge to large distributors, such as ourselves, who are able to service the entire value chain and make strategic acquisitions. The increasing technical complexity of spare parts in the automotive industry is also favorable to us. The higher complexity and value of repair operations are difficult to manage by small independent aftermarket players without support and technical assistance from expert distributors such as ourselves and drives a strong and structural increase in spare parts prices and margins. Future technological evolutions are partly driven by the increasing popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles and of mobility and connectivity services. We forecast that 5.1% of addressable cars will be electric or hybrid by 2030. We also believe that by 2030 up to 1.1% of 112 ----- addressable cars will benefit from automated driving systems which will result in higher prices of components for these vehicles. Furthermore, as a result of the focus on safety and aesthetics, light vehicle body parts have improved in quality, from steel-made to aluminum and carbon fiber-made products, which has also increased prices of the body parts that we distribute. A carbon fiber bumper, for example, is four times more expensive than the current glass fiber bumpers. We are able to combine the significant advantage of having a well-known and trusted core brand with the ability to use affiliated garage networks to target specific markets. Our superior brand awareness is evidence of our strong positioning in the IAMs in which we operate. According to an independent third-party survey conducted in France in 2017, the “Autodistribution” brand enjoyed the highest brand awareness among its light vehicle distributor peers in France, with 92% brand awareness (including unprompted awareness of 74% and prompted awareness of 18%). The second ranking player in France had only 37% brand awareness. The “Autodistribution” brand also had a net promoter score of 59% in 2017; the two second ranking players had net promoter scores of 31%. 113 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Our strengths,18.11.3,Differentiated and successfully integrated omni-channel business model,"One of our key strengths is our control over the value chain through our omni-channel operational model that delivers superior product availability and best-in-class delivery lead times. Our distribution is carried out by a variety of wholly-owned distributors, AD-affiliated distributors and local wholesale distributors who distribute our products to a variety of customers, including AD-branded garages, independent garages, retail locations and online players. Our ability to control the value chain from suppliers, through logistics and distribution, to customers has a strong impact on margins. For example, our automated platforms enable us to centralize more flows, which in turn generates logistics fees from suppliers. Generally, the logistics fees we charge to suppliers are greater than the logistics costs we incur. Our unique operational model is founded on our long-standing relationships with suppliers, state-of-the-art fully-integrated logistical platforms and an extensive Western European distribution network. We have a broad and loyal customer base to whom we deliver a wide range of value-added services. We have also been able to adapt this business model to the markets in which we operate. We have also been able to adapt this business model to our markets in Belgium and Italy, where distribution is organized in three steps with “jobbers” acting as intermediaries between distributors and B2B end-customers (these jobbers are our direct customers instead of garages). Our model is based on the distinctive, dual proposition of distributing products to customers coupled with providing value-added services (many of which are digital or online services) to both suppliers and customers. To suppliers, our scale offers a unique access to a wide, diversified and fragmented customer base, which suppliers are not able to efficiently address themselves. We have built long-term relationships and enjoy significant purchasing power with a strategically concentrated group of suppliers, with whom we can leverage 114 ----- our scale to obtain excellent purchasing conditions for our CPUs. Through this supplier concentration strategy, we have rationalized our supplier relationships, reducing our number of suppliers from 293 in 2010 to approximately 260 in 2019. We also offer suppliers a number of value-added services, such as marketing support and access to our state-of-the-art automated warehousing capabilities which allow suppliers to arrange deliveries to a single delivery point. To customers, we provide a comprehensive product offering and best-in-class delivery times (h+2 delivery time on 90% of B2B customer demand) combined with value-added services, such as commercial, technical and training support, strong and integrated branding and online tools. As a result of our combined product and services offerings, we are a “one-stop” shop to our customers, which we believe strengthens customer loyalty and drives market share gain. Unlike many of our competitors, our product range is not limited to certain OEM or original equipment suppliers (“OES”) parts or to certain types of products. Our product offering covers approximately 600,000 SKUs (excluding Oscaro) across the spare parts universe, including repair and maintenance parts, body parts, repairer equipment, oil, tires, consumables and accessories. Additionally, we have developed our own private label brands: ISOTECH, Xenergy and Requal, which allow us to offer premium grade products approximately 20% to 30% cheaper than our OEM counterparts and to efficiently target the older part of the car parc which is subject to a higher price sensitivity. The ongoing centralization of sourcing across our private label brands allows us to generate higher margins on our private label products compared to third-party branded products, despite the lower price of the former. We are also well positioned to address mobility shifts, in particular with our customers involved in fleet management, through which public fleets play an increasingly important role. With our state-of-the-art logistics platforms and extensive range of value-added customer service solutions, we are well positioned to meet the needs of fleet operators who look to external supply and fleet management on a large scale. In recent years, we have been systematically improving our distribution models for our Light Vehicle France and Trucks segments, thereby complementing our supplier concentration strategy and strategic investments in our automated logistics platforms. We are currently finalizing the implementation of a new distribution model for our Trucks segment which has allowed us to grow our network of affiliated garages and to reorganize our former network of 125 distribution sites around 10 regional warehouses as of December 31, 2019, which can better focus on distribution to local sites, owned and independent garages and integrated workshops. As a result of this reorganization, we have been able to better utilize our large network and unique range of value-added services to meet customer demand and we became the only player in the French truck spare parts market able to serve our full range of customers with two daily deliveries made within four hours.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Our B2B car repair and maintenance portals increase the integration of our distribution business with our technical support capacities, helping us increase customer loyalty. We also offer online tools for our customers’ clientele, such as the ID Garages online portal, which allows drivers to schedule maintenance appointments, compare prices and receive quotes for work to be performed on their vehicles. These services and tools enable our customers to expand their business. Our approach to capturing the advantages created by an increasingly digitalized ecosystem stretches across every level of our business. We use digital tools to bolster our value-added services offering to suppliers and customers, expand our product offering, address a growing online customer base and digitize our operational model. We therefore believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing importance of the digital marketplace, which is the fastest growing independent aftermarket distribution channel in France and grew at a CAGR of 11.4% between 2014 and 2018. We have also made deep and long-standing investments to increase our web dealer customer base and gain exposure to the online distribution market. As part of this strategy, we acquired ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in 2016, two distribution platforms dedicated to web dealers.

Oscaro’s acquisition allowed us to become a truly “omni-channel” distributor in France 115 ----- and the only multichannel B2C (DIY) player in the independent aftermarket auto parts distribution sector in Europe. In 2019, we served approximately 2.5 million customers in France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, received approximately 12,000 orders a day and a portfolio of approximately 1 million SKUs through Oscaro. Oscaro has a strong leadership in the growing French online light vehicle spare parts aftermarket with an approximate market share of over 47% in 2019, mainly due to its customer loyalty and high brand awareness. Oscaro was the first entrant in the online distribution market in France and benefits from an outstanding brand awareness in France due to its compelling value proposition and expertise (approximately 62% awareness, which is more than three times as much as its closest competitor on the online distribution market). Oscaro’s leading market share, superior purchasing terms and, following its integration within the Group, competitive price strategy positions it well to compete against generalist online players. The automotive spare parts distribution business requires a very detailed product offering, a highly technical catalog and data repository, to address a wide range of parts for a multitude of vehicles of various brands, that generalist online players have difficulty offering as they primarily focus on consumables. In addition, they cannot replicate the purchasing terms we obtain through our win-win partnerships with suppliers.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Over the same period, profitability also grew. In the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA was €83.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.6%. In the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 increased to €202.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 margin was 11.2%. The average organic growth in Adjusted EBITDA was approximately 6.3% per annum over the 2015 to 2019 period. Our organic growth has been supported by various factors, such as the development of our distribution model (which has bolstered our offering to customers, thus leading to market share gains), our exposure to fastgrowing channels (such as web dealers), our successful recruiting of new branded garages, the development of our private-label offers, improved purchasing conditions obtained through our supplier concentration strategy and our distribution network optimization strategy. In recent years we have demonstrated stable organic growth overall, particularly in the resilient light vehicle IAM, as a result of good purchasing conditions with suppliers, network rationalization, recruitment of approximately 70 AD branded garages (net) per year from 2010 to 2019 with a churn rate of less than 5% and the disposal of non-core assets. Our model is based in part on the delivery of value-added services to both suppliers and customers. These value-added services not only generate fees from suppliers but also promote loyalty from customers, helping us grow our market share. In addition, we have a strong track record of pursuing value-enhancing acquisitions and successfully realizing synergies with such targets. In the past six years, we have made 13 sizeable acquisitions. We acquired over €800 million in revenue through acquisitions since 2014, of which the 2014 acquisition of ACR in France accounted for approximately €92 million, the 2016 acquisitions of Doyen Auto in the Netherlands and Automax in France collectively accounted for approximately €174 million, the 2017 acquisitions of ADB in Belgium, OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto in Italy and Mondial Pare-Brise in France collectively accounted for approximately €147 million, the 2018 acquisitions of Geevers in the Netherlands, G-Group in Italy, Verviers Freins in Belgium and Oscaro in France collectively accounted for approximately €355 million and the 2019 acquisition of AD Bosch in Spain accounted for an annualized revenue of approximately €62 million. Each of these acquisitions has been supported by a clear external growth strategy focused on neighboring European countries with similar car parcs to France and targeting strong local leaders with potential to quickly generate purchasing synergies, align interests with management, expand the reach of our operations and increase exposure to fast-growing segments and markets. We have a strong track record of successful integrations in our Group, and our acquisitions have demonstrated favorable pre- and post-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiples (calculated as enterprise value divided by EBITDA) as well as our ability to grow revenue and EBITDA following an acquisition: - _ACR: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 8x, as compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 4x; - _Doyen-Auto: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 12x, as compared with post- synergy multiple of approximately 5x; 116 ----- - _Mondial Pare-Brise: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 9x, as compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 6x; and - _OVAM, Ricauto and Top Car: pre-synergy EBITDA acquisition multiple of approximately 10x, as compared with post-synergy multiple of approximately 7x. In addition, we implemented various initiatives following our acquisition of Oscaro and brought Oscaro back to profitability in the third quarter of the year 2019 and reaching positive EBITDA for the full year 2019. These initiatives were part of a comprehensive turnaround plan addressing Oscaro’s key issues through increased client communication, PR and marketing spend and the implementation of full client and suppliers overdue payment and full customer refund plans. In addition to these immediate actions taken following the acquisition of Oscaro, we sought to further enhance Oscaro’s profitability through purchasing synergies, supply chain and delivery optimizations and competitive pricing. We also sought to increase Oscaro’s integration to our Group’s culture and governance by strengthening its management team and implementing clear processes.",,as_expected,2020,482,

This reflects a CAGR of 17.0% between the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2019, with average organic growth of approximately 3.5% per annum over the 2015 to 2019 period. We increased our Adjusted EBITDA from €83.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, to €154.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2019. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, which illustrates the effects that acquisitions would have had if such acquisitions had taken effect on April 1, 2019 was €219.9 million. We operate a business model that requires a relatively low capital expenditure, using rented facilities without needing to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our capital expenditures amounted to 2.2% of our revenue and consisted of maintenance expenditures for our distribution facilities and upgrades to our sales and warehouse IT management systems. Our low level of capital expenditures has been stable in recent years, with capital expenditure for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, at 2.2%, 2.2% and 2.2% of revenue, respectively (excluding Logisteo for the year ended December 31, 2017). Our low levels of maintenance capital expenditure requirements have allowed us to invest in our business in order to maintain our leading market positions and improve operating efficiency, as well as achieve deleveraging through EBITDA growth and cash generation.

Our CEO, Mr. Stéphane Antiglio, and CFO, Mr. Christophe Gouthière, have a proven track record in developing and implementing turnaround and growth strategies. Mr. Stéphane Antiglio is the former CEO of Pomona Passion Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Mr. Christophe Gouthière was previously European CFO of the Dole Group, a leading distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our CEO and CFO are supported by an experienced management team and, together, they have successfully implemented profit improvement initiatives and integrated thirteen new businesses into the Group in the last seven years.

We aim to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer service, rationalize flows and optimize inventory and warehousing. We focus on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the regional level, while maintaining excellent delivery times. For example, since 2014, we have redesigned and refined our Light Vehicle France distribution model, moving from a large number of delivery sites acting as intermediaries between suppliers and our logistics platforms and garage customers, to a more precisely deployed network of regional pivot sites that connect suppliers and our logistics platforms with local delivery sites, which are strategically located to address customer demand. A key component of this strategy is our ongoing efforts to grow our affiliated network of garages. In 2017, we further enhanced our Light Vehicle France distribution model by introducing a fully automated national logistic platform (Logisteo) that enabled same-day stock deliveries to distributors in France. Logisteo allowed us to significantly improve our distribution model by increasing the consolidation of our supply flows to a single delivery point from 18% in 2014 to 64% in 2018 resulting in approximately 30% gain in productivity. We expect that our new model will further improve distributor performance with optimized inventory levels and SKU availability and an increased ability to adapt our offer to local customer requirements, leading to an enhanced customer experience. We continue to seek ways to optimize our operations and business model to further improve delivery times, quality of service and availability of products, each of which are expected to help us gain greater market share in the geographies where we operate.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Our strategy,18.12.2,Increase exposure to higher growth businesses,"In recent years, we have undertaken specific steps to focus on and penetrate superior growth businesses in the aftermarket spare parts distribution market: online web dealers, body parts and windshields. We have developed our online presence with external web dealers through the acquisitions of ACR and Doyen Auto, two platforms focused on web dealers, to become their expert distribution partner. We believe that business with web dealers present superior growth opportunities, and we intend to further increase our exposure to these customers in the coming years. For example, we established a key account unit between ACR and Doyen Auto to focus on web dealers. Our strategic partnership with Oscaro, launched in 2013, was also part of this strategy. We then increased our presence in the online distribution business when we acquired Oscaro in November 2018, and we have engaged in a strategic plan to become a European leader in online automotive spare parts by consolidating our position in France and in Western Europe, mainly Spain, Belgium and Italy, with a focus on EBITDA generation. 118 ----- We also believe that the body parts and windshield segment represents a high growth business. Following significant market share gains in this segment, we invested in the development of the Cora distribution platform in France and in 2018 completed the acquisition of Geevers, a body parts specialist in the Netherlands. We also entered the windshield segment through our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise in 2017, a retail business focused on glazing repair, and have focused on the development of a sizeable presence in France, reaching 324 workshops in 2018. We intend to expand the reach of our current platforms and develop a distribution service to external glazing repair players by leveraging our scale and purchase expertise. In addition, we intend to pursue the development of Mondial Pare-Brise, aiming to add 15 Urban Master Centers in large cities in France by 2025.",,as_expected,2020,482,

We aim to pursue the optimization of our supplier relationships and to further improve purchasing terms with our growing negotiating power due to our European scale and our optimized logistics, while maintaining a sufficient number of suppliers to avoid undue reliance on any particular suppliers. We also see further opportunities to concentrate our supply flows and plan to select no more than two or three suppliers per product or sub-category of product in the near future. We expect that this strategy will continue to improve product availability and profitability. In addition, we intend to continue expanding our private label offerings, by deepening our sourcing in Asia while maintaining high quality standards. We also intend to introduce private label offerings in our acquired businesses and ensure supplier concentration. Our expansion strategy for our private label offerings is expected to optimize production costs, while increasing volumes sold per SKU and allowing us to negotiate improved purchasing conditions with the suppliers of these products, in turn leading to profitable growth through margin expansion.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Our strategy,18.12.4,Reinforce cost efficiency initiatives at both local distribution and central and administrative levels,"We operate a fully-integrated supply chain that connects our strategically concentrated group of suppliers to our CPUs and state-of-the-art logistics platforms, through to an extensive distribution network that serves more than 70,000 customers with deliveries several times per day and with best-in-class delivery times. We intend to build on our history of operational excellence by continuing to integrate and rationalize our supply chain to improve cost efficiency. We believe this approach will help us maintain and further enhance our strong and unique positioning as a central distribution intermediary for all value chain levels and to reinforce our role as an important link between parts suppliers and customers. Based on the value that we have extracted from operational improvements in recent years, we believe that continual improvements to our supply chain will contribute to increased market share and expanded margins. For example, our increasing use of centralized, automated platforms simplifies the delivery processes for our suppliers by offering them a single delivery point. We also offer suppliers a range of innovative value-added services such as marketing tools and intelligence, online support tools, payment guarantees and a centralized invoicing system with simplified back office support, all of which help suppliers grow their own business while creating greater efficiencies through simplified tracking, delivery, monitoring and payment solutions. We believe that these services represent advantages that are a “win-win” proposition for us and our suppliers, differentiating us from our competitors. We are also pursuing increased integration of our supply chain, which is based on two flows of spare parts: a “direct delivery flow” from suppliers to distributors and a “platform-based flow” through our logistics platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2019, 64% of our products were distributed via our logistics platform, as compared with 18% in 2010, representing an improvement that we intend to pursue by further developing our platform-based flow. This approach is expected to improve product availability and delivery times while being cost efficient and generating favorable financial conditions for us, due in part to the higher logistics fees which we can apply in this context, and which we expect will lead to higher margins, as the logistics fees received from suppliers generally exceed the related costs of operating the logistics platforms. In particular, our new, automated platforms, such as Logisteo, generally offer a doubled capacity for SKUs as well as doubled processing capacity, allowing us to offer more SKUs from a wider range of product lines and suppliers. We will pursue this strategy by encouraging new suppliers to make deliveries through the platform flow from the outset as well as by having existing supplies expand the breadth of their range offered through our platform-based flow. In addition, we believe that our extensive distribution network is a key part to our success. We employ a cost-conscious approach to manage our distribution network, constantly focusing on improving network 119 ----- efficiency and coverage, while minimizing or eliminating redundancies wherever possible. For example, in our Light Vehicle France segment, we are currently focused on ongoing upgrades to our real estate parc and improvements to the size and coverage of our footprint of distribution sites in France. When and where necessary, we remodel, close or consolidate sites. We also work to lower and rationalize downstream logistics costs by maximizing the square footage of our sites and by modernizing our logistics and monitoring functions, such as through the increased use of bar coding and the creation of a dedicated logistics department. In our Trucks segment, we are implementing an improvement plan that is focused on closing low- and non-performing sites in the context of a broader profit-focused effort to optimize our distribution network.",,as_expected,2020,482,

This M&A process is centered around careful evaluation of potential targets, which are usually selected from local leaders that offer significant purchasing synergies. Through strategic acquisitions, we have penetrated new geographies, for example through our acquisitions of Doyen Auto and AD Bosch, which allowed us to expand into Benelux and Spain, respectively, as well as broaden our reach or product offering in the countries in which we already operate, for example through our acquisition of Mondial Pare-Brise, which allowed us to offer a full range of windscreen replacement products in France. In addition, through the acquisition of Oscaro in France, we have penetrated the B2C (DIY) segment and strengthened our position in the e-commerce market. We intend to leverage our market knowledge to continue to roll-out Oscaro to our markets outside of France. We intend to continue making strategic, value-accretive acquisitions in the short and the medium term, including in certain geographies adjacent to the countries in which we operate. We intend to focus on new geographies where the car parcs are similar enough to those in which we are already active to realize synergies and where we can effectively use our logistics platforms and distribution networks. We also intend to consolidate our leadership in the countries where we are already present, building on areas of strength and taking advantage of the fragmented nature of these markets. We believe that the consolidation of these markets will accelerate following the COVID-19 crisis, driven by small players that we believe are likely to have been impacted by liquidity constraints to a greater extent than ourselves. We further intend to leverage our expertise in our Light Vehicle France segment to expand and diversify our presence in other countries by undertaking proven successful initiatives. For example, we are in the process of strengthening the Autodistribution brand in Belgium and the Netherlands, expanding our product range in Italy, notably in our private label offerings and body part product range, and growing our online penetration with high-momentum customers such as web dealers in Belgium.",,as_expected,2020,482,

We estimate that the full year effect of the acquisition of Oscaro would represent a contribution to our Adjusted EBITDA—IFRS 16 of approximately €21 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, after taking into account the run-rate impact of our turnaround plan for Oscaro already completed (approximately €7 million) and of additional cost optimization measures and purchasing synergies to be implemented (approximately €10 million), including overhead and supply chain cost reduction and new growth initiatives. We intend to build on Oscaro’s successful turnaround to deliver our online growth strategy and become a leading European auto parts online retailer with sustainable margins by 2025. Our strategy consists in strengthening Oscaro’s position in France by reinforcing its position on current categories, developing new categories, such as commercial vehicles, and by improving the customer experience through the website but also with a better customer service throughout the delivery chain.

In particular, we intend to capitalize on our value-added services in order to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, increase customer loyalty and gain market share. In terms of M&A-led growth, we are focused on improving Adjusted EBITDA in terms of absolute value and Adjusted EBITDA margin. In order to do this, we put increasing focus on executing value-accretive M&A transactions and successfully and efficiently integrating acquired businesses into the Group. In terms of our multi-channel approach, we intend to continue to grow our online product offering in France and in other markets and to strengthen our position in the B2C (DIY) segment.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,History,18.13.1,,"We were founded in 1962 to formalize the cooperation among a number of existing independent light vehicle aftermarket distributors and quickly became a key operator in France, providing a link between original equipment suppliers and spare parts suppliers on the one hand, and garages, local spare parts distributors, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers on the other hand. In 1983, we expanded our footprint throughout France, both at the distributor level and the garage level, by forming our network of wholly-owned distributors and in 1985, rolling out our concept of a network of branded garages that comprised key customers that operate independently from the Group. We launched our truck business in 1988 to supply spare parts for trucks, tractors and trailers. We were the first independent distributor network of spare parts for trucks in France. We have continued expanding our logistics platforms, distribution network and our products and services offering in France through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. For example, we enhanced our logistics platforms and expanded our offering to include body parts through the acquisitions of Cora, a leading independent French distributor of light vehicle parts for collision repair in 2005, and Bremstar, a distributor with a logistics platform dedicated to truck parts for maintenance and repair, in 2008. Between 2012 and 2017, we acquired a number of French light vehicle and truck distributors including Gobillot Rhône (previously Ensemble), FPLS, Rougon Queyrel, Electro Diesel Service, ADB, API Marne, API Aube and acquired a minority stake in Société Lyonnaise de Pneumatiques et Accessoires. In 2017, we purchased Mondial Pare-Brise, a French auto glass repair network expanding into a product range that complements our existing offering and in 2018 we purchased Oscaro, a French online distributor of light vehicle spare parts. We also distribute our own private label product offerings, ISOTECH (rolled out in 2001), Requal and Xenergy, which feature spare parts, such as batteries, brake pads, lubricants, water pumps and headlights. We have also expanded into complementary channels and to address new customer bases. For example, we have progressively enhanced our online offering. We created the Autossimo online B2B light vehicle repair and 121 ----- maintenance web portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online B2B truck repair and maintenance web portal in 2001. As another example, in 2014, we acquired ACR, a specialized distributor in France of light vehicle spare parts and, in 2016, Doyen Auto, a Belgium-headquartered distributor of aftermarket light vehicle spare parts, enabling us to become a leading distributor to online players, and to expand our platform to serve our key customers. We also created www.idgarages.com, which allows customers to locate and compare garages and schedule service appointments online, and has led to the development of our relationships with web dealers. We also have a history of successfully acquiring and integrating strategic targets in adjacent geographic markets. In 2007, our previous shareholder introduced the business into the Polish market by purchasing three local distributors that operated as the key distributors for our Polish subsidiary, AD Polska. In August 2017, our current management made a strategic exit from the Polish market as part of our network rationalization strategy, divesting AD Polska to Rhiag Group. In 2017, we entered the Italian market with the creation of a joint company, Autodis Italia Holding S.r.l., with three Italian distributors, OVAM, Top Car and Ricauto, and in 2018, we acquired G-Group, an independent spare parts distributor in Italy. In 2016, we acquired the Doyen Auto Group, allowing us to expand into Benelux and in 2018 we acquired Geevers and Verviers Freins, further expanding our operations in Benelux. In 2019, we acquired a 75.10% stake in AD Bosch for a consideration of €48.1 million which enabled us to enter the Spanish market. AD Bosch is a leading B2B independent spare parts distributor in Catalonia with approximately 27 sites as of December 2019. AD Bosch is one of the largest members of AD Parts, a leading independent auto parts network of purchasing, distribution, manufacturing and services in Iberia that regroups approximately 27 independent affiliated distributors. AD Parts comprises approximately 490 distribution centers in Spain and Portugal and has historically demonstrated a strong growth track record, gaining market share from its competitors. We have also developed and implemented operating strategies designed to increase our revenue, reduce our leverage, costs and capital expenditures and improve margins. These strategies include the introduction of a new management team in 2010, the implementation of a profit improvement plan, the revision of distributor margins and the rollout of fully-integrated logistics platforms such as Logisteo. For example, we have revisited our previous centralized approach and have now implemented a transparent model with a rationalized distribution network, which has led to higher customer loyalty. We were acquired by our current principal shareholder, Bain Capital, in 2015. Since 2015, we have diversified and internationalized our business with new product and channel offerings and expansions into adjacent geographies.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Our operational model,18.14.1,Procurement and suppliers,"Our procurement strategy is organized around suppliers, our CPUs and our private label offerings, ISOTECH, Requal and Xenergy. _Central purchasing units_ Our CPUs buy aftermarket spare parts, equipment and tools from suppliers. We use our CPUs to monitor customer purchases across our network and to adjust our product portfolio in order to meet customer demand. We seek to buy in large quantities so that the savings made by buying in bulk offset the costs associated with maintaining inventories at our warehouses. _Suppliers_ Our key suppliers are OESs. We have cultivated long-term relationships with most of our suppliers. Our suppliers are geographically diversified, based across France (Valeo), Italy (Filtrauto), Germany (Bosch, KnorrBremse and Schaeffler), Sweden (SKF) and the United States (Gates, Tenneco and TRW Automotive). This approach to sourcing allows us to cover the full portfolio of products that our customers seek, while retaining control over our relationships with suppliers and optimizing our sourcing across multiple countries. Our leading market position, large-scale operations, large purchasing volumes and centralized purchasing approach provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates and fees with our suppliers. These rebates and fees lower the purchase price we pay by 15% to 20% and include service and logistics fees charged by us to suppliers as well as end-of-year volume rebates, strategic rebates and AD International rebates applied by suppliers. For example, our logistical capabilities enable suppliers to make 122 ----- deliveries to a single point, allowing us to charge suppliers logistics fees which are generally greater than the logistics costs that we incur. Moreover, we benefit from a competitive pricing policy in relation to suppliers, the price of spare parts being indexed to that of equivalent OEM spare parts and thus reflecting inflation. Suppliers also benefit from their relationship with us, which provides them with increased volumes and offers a number of value-added services, in exchange for a fee, as well as unique access to our customer base. The fees paid by suppliers constitute approximately 15% to 21% of the total fees received from suppliers The services that we offer to our suppliers are focused on improving these suppliers’ efficiency and promoting their products and include: - Marketing tools: we offer information about suppliers’ products to customers and promote suppliers’ products, including in connection with new product launches. - Online support: we include references to suppliers’ products in our online portals (such as Autossimo, Truckissimo and Salto), which help increase brand and product awareness for suppliers and generate orders. - Invoicing and back-office support: we offer a central ordering, purchasing and invoicing system and suppliers benefit from having a single invoicing counterparty and from payment guarantees. - Market intelligence: we give suppliers access to our market data. In addition to the services described above, we also give our suppliers access to ADI, a purchasing group of aftermarket distributors, which we founded. ADI has 24 members, of which we are the leader, accounting for 23% of purchases, while the second largest member accounts for 21% of purchases. In 2019, ADI generated €6.9 billion in revenue and was present in 40 countries. ADI works with 40 suppliers, 415 distributors (who have access to 2,891 distribution outlets) and 9,900 AD-branded garages across 20 countries. ADI benefits members by giving them enhanced negotiating power with major suppliers, allowing them to operate under a common brand, enabling them to share know-how and offering support services such as diagnostic tools and a technical hotline. ADI benefits suppliers by giving them access to an international network of distributors with high sales volumes and extensive customer coverage, giving such suppliers high levels of visibility into the market. In 2019, we worked with 260 main suppliers (as compared with 293 suppliers in 2010) and our top ten suppliers provided approximately 50% of our products by volume (as compared with 35% in 2010). In 2019, our top three suppliers provided 26% of our products by volume and no supplier other than the top three suppliers provided more than 5% of our products by volume. We are one of the top three clients of Bosch, Schaeffler and Federal Mogul and are Filtrauto’s number one client. We select our suppliers via tender procedures for each product category that we distribute. When selecting our suppliers, we take into account the quality and price of the spare parts or products, as well as the supplier’s ability to deliver items within the deadlines required. For example, we select our brake and battery suppliers every three years. We generally enter into annually renewable contracts with our suppliers, which include standard terms and conditions, such as supply specifications regarding lead time, frequency of deliveries, packaging and performance target and rebates. _Private label offerings_ In addition to our procurement activities described above, we distribute products from our own private label offerings, ISOTECH, Requal and Xenergy, whom we source from manufacturers to which we subcontract production. ISOTECH is a high quality product line we relaunched in 2008 to cover the French market, which offered approximately 3,500 SKUs for the light vehicle aftermarket as well as truck parts for maintenance and repair in 2019. ISOTECH’s product offering is focused on the older part of the car parc and truck fleet (i.e. vehicles aged over eight years) and ISOTECH’s offering is comprehensive, covering most of the needs of the car parc. We offer competitive pricing on ISOTECH products to customers by giving a discount to prevailing market prices. Despite these lower prices, we benefit from more attractive margins on ISOTECH products as compared with third-party branded products. Additionally, the ISOTECH product line serves a strategic response to certain of the pricing pressures created by web dealers. The penetration rate of the ISOTECH offering has been growing steadily. In 2015, we expanded the ISOTECH offering to include equipment, which we source from Asia, while carefully monitoring product quality and lead times. Revenue from ISOTECH equipment has grown substantially since the creation of the offering, reaching €5.0 million in 2019 compared to €0.6 million in 2015. In 2019, ISOTECH products represented approximately 5% of our total sales and approximately 9% of our light vehicle sales in France. 123 ----- Requal is a product line of light vehicle spare parts, such as brake pads and wiper parts, that is focused on price-competitive products for cars aged four years and older and that covers the Benelux market. We acquired the Requal brand in connection with our acquisition of the Doyen Auto Group in 2016. Xenergy is our private label covering the Italian market that is CE certified, composed of these 9 family products: Brakes, Shock absorbers, Batteries, Bulbs, Alternators / Starters, Wipers, Water pumps, Filters, Lubricants. Xenergy has now reached €8 million of annual turnover with an average margin of 40%.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Our operational model,18.14.2,Upstream logistics control,"The flow of products purchased by our CPUs is mainly managed by our logistics platforms. Our upstream logistics control model is state-of-the-art, featuring automated central warehouses that have enabled us to reduce costs while improving product availability and delivery times. Our logistics platforms have the following key responsibilities: - _Inbound logistics: accepting incoming products from suppliers and monitoring compliance with negotiated specifications. - _Stocking: determining the shelf space to be allocated to each product and shelf placement in accordance with turnover indices and product size. The proper placement of products within the dedicated space is crucial to optimize available space. - _Picking, packing and outbound logistics: space management allows us to maximize efficiency in locating and retrieving products from the shelves and assembling orders of outgoing products. If products have not been previously packaged by the suppliers, our logistics platforms are able to carry out this activity. - _Shipping: organizing and monitoring transportation. Our logistical operations include two flows of spare parts: a direct delivery flow from suppliers to distributors and a platform-based flow through our logistics platforms. In the year ended December 31, 2019, 64% of our products were distributed via our platform-based flow, as compared to 18% in 2010. Our strategy is to further develop the platform-based flow because it drives improved product availability and delivery times and leads to favorable financial conditions for us, such as higher logistics fees applied by our suppliers. The transport of products from our logistics platforms to our distribution network is carried out through independent carriers. Our logistics department is responsible for setting performance targets and related incentives and penalties for third-party carriers, while continuously monitoring the performance of carriers in order to improve customer service. We plan and monitor product flows through our IT systems. We lease, rather than own, most of our logistics platforms, thereby limiting our permanent investment in fixed assets. Our Light Vehicle France segment is serviced by three logistics platforms: Logisteo (our automated warehouse), ACR (focused on key accounts and online customers) and Cora (focused on light vehicle body parts for collision repair). Our Light Vehicle International segment is serviced by different logistics platforms: Doyen Auto and Geevers (covering Belgium and the Netherlands as well as certain online customers), OVAM/Ricauto and G-Group for body parts (covering Italy) and AD Bosch (covering Spain). Our Trucks segment is serviced by one logistics platform, Bremstar.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Our operational model,18.14.3,Local distribution,"Our local distribution model includes wholly-owned distributors (“wholly-owned distributors”) and independent distributors affiliated with us (“affiliated independent distributors”), as well as local wholesalers who are not affiliated with us and online players. Our distribution network in France is dense and allows us to offer customers premium solutions and services. In the light vehicle spare parts distribution aftermarket, our dense distribution network enables us to keep products close to customers and make up to six deliveries per day to most customers. As a result, distributors are able to provide their customers with best-in-class delivery lead times, with deliveries to garages generally able to be made in under two hours when necessary, deliveries to key accounts generally able to be made in under two hours when necessary or one business day and deliveries to web dealers generally able to be made within four hours or one business day. The density of our local distribution network also gives us the ability to negotiate with key accounts at a national level. 124 ----- The map below shows our distribution locations in France, with a focus on the French Alps region to demonstrate how we deploy a mix of regional hubs, local distribution sites and proximity collection sites. As of December 31, 2019, we operated a network of 31 wholly-owned distributors and 53 affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out of approximately 487 owned and affiliated distribution locations as of December 31, 2019, overall, making us the largest independent single-branded light vehicle spare parts distribution network in France and enabling us to cover 90% of customer demand and 90% of spare parts. Our contractual arrangements with our affiliated independent distributors include agreements and commercial contracts, which are negotiated every seven years and which were last renewed on April 13, 2015. Pursuant to our affiliation agreements, our affiliated independent distributors agree to operate under the Autodistribution brand and to receive our support services in exchange for a membership fee. Our CPUs enter into commercial contracts with both our wholly-owned distributors and our affiliated independent distributors, which include the same purchase conditions and volume discounts for both affiliated independent distributors and wholly-owned distributors. Our affiliated independent distributors receive a loyalty bonus if the purchases made through our CPUs account for at least 84% of their overall purchase volumes, with an average of almost 90% of affiliated independent distributor purchases being made through our CPUs in 2019. Additionally, we pass on a portion of the rebates we receive from suppliers to our affiliated independent distributors and our whollyowned distributors pass on a portion of the rebates to the garages to which they sell. Our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors also benefit from belonging to a single brand. We involve our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors in governance and decision-making through an annual steering committee. In recent years, we have redesigned our Light Vehicle France distribution model to improve our operational efficiency, enhance customer service, cover multiple regions with small regional platforms (“pivot sites”), rationalize flows and optimize inventory and warehousing, focusing on offering higher availability of more SKUs at the regional level and with excellent delivery times. 125 ----- The graphic below compares our Light Vehicle France distribution model as it operated before 2014 with our current distribution model. This new model leads to the consolidation of supplies in a single delivery point, from 17% in 2010 to 64% in 2020, and therefore generating lower suppliers transport costs and overall serving costs, which are shared between the Group and its suppliers. We are currently making similar changes to the management strategy and distribution model in our Trucks segment. We have reduced our number of truck spare parts distribution regions to seven (as compared with ten in 2016), by closing certain loss-making locations and merging other locations in order to reduce overlaps. We are in the process of expanding our AD Poids Lourds-branded garages, having recruited 110 AD Poids Lourds on 2019, with the objective of reaching 250 distribution and repair sites, including 150 AD Poids Lourds garages, by 2025. We are also working to rationalize our AD Poids Lourds network by closing certain loss-making locations and merging other locations in order to reduce overlaps. In addition, we are also in the process of redesigning our truck spare parts distribution model, with ten platforms already deployed and three more expected to be deployed by the end of 2020. The graphic below compares our truck spare parts distribution model as it operated before 2017 with the distribution model that is being implemented. Our new truck spare parts distribution model has increased the number of regional warehouses to 10 as of December 31, 2019 (as compared to six in 2017), leading to higher product availability at regional level, stocking 25,000 SKUs exclusively for trucks. 126 ----- The redesign of our distribution models is part of a larger project that we have undertaken to modernize our networks. Other components of this effort include the rationalization and upgrading of our real estate parc, with the consolidation of the number of locations to 228 in 2019 (excluding recently opened proximity, OTC locations) (as compared to 230 locations in 2014) and the rationalization of our storage capacity (from approximately 356,000 square meters in 2014 to approximately 335,000 square meters in 2017), the modernization of our logistics platforms, with 100% of our platforms now using bar codes for inventory management and the creation of a dedicated logistics department, and the modernization of our monitoring systems, with the implementation of performance and operational indicators. The efforts have had a positive impact, as evidenced by an increase in revenue per employee (from €225,000 per employee in 2014 to €245,000 per employee in 2019).",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Our operational model,18.14.4,Customers,"Our local distribution networks distribute parts, equipment and tools to our light vehicle customers, including garages, body shops, fast-fitters, online operators and integrated workshops, some of which we are affiliated with (but, in the case of our light vehicle activities, not owned by us) and operate under our brands (“branded garages”) and others of which are independent (with no formal affiliation with us and sometimes affiliated with an OEM), as well as our key accounts. Our truck spare parts distribution customers are garages, certified repairers/agents, integrated workshops and key accounts. Our truck repair and maintenance customers, served through our wholly-owned garages, are truck fleet owners and operators and integrated workshops. In 2019, we distributed products to 62,846 regular professional customers in France. As of December 31, 2019, there were 3,673 branded garages in our customer network. In 2019, garages represented 38% of our customer base, followed by wholesalers (27%), retail (21%), online (2%), key accounts (5%). Other customers represented 7% of our customer base in 2019. Our principal customers are garages. We distribute products to independent garages (including those that are affiliated with OEMs) as well as to the AD-branded garages, including AD Expert (with approximately 1,394 points of sale in 2019), AD Poids Lourds (with approximately 228 points of sale in 2019, of which 70 were wholly-owned by us), AD Carrosserie (primarily serving independent body shops, with approximately 678 points of sale in 2019), Auto Primo (primarily serving rural and semi-rural repair shops, with approximately 1,039 points of sale in 2019) and Mondial Pare-Brise (offering auto glass repair at approximately 326 locations in 2019). We enter into agreements with independent garages, pursuant to which they become AD-branded garages and receive enhanced service and support from us in exchange for a membership fee and our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their preferred distributors of spare parts. Our branded garages in our light vehicle activities are not owned by us. Joining the AD brand allows garages to remain independent while gaining the benefit of accessing our services and the commercial terms that we have negotiated with suppliers. 127 ----- We also benefit from our network of branded garages, which made us the largest and the fastest growing light vehicle garage network in France in 2017 after PSA, during the years 2014 to 2018, as shown in the graphic below.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Additionally, our network of branded garages provides us with a reliable source of orders since branded garages agree to purchase a minimum amount (generally 70%) of their products from us per year and also pay fees to us in exchange for certain value-added services. We also distribute products to retail and other outlets such as Midas, Euromaster and Speedy and to certain “key accounts” that have a national presence (such as Feu Vert, Norauto and Auto 5). Our key accounts represent an increasing share of our revenue. In 2014, sales to key accounts represented €44 million of our revenue and in 2019, they represented €45.6 million of our revenue. We also distribute our products to web dealers (such as Mister Auto). Our sales to web dealers account for an increasing share of our revenue. We offer a one-stop-shop scheme designed to match our customers’ needs, which vary according to customer type. For example, our garage customers, focused on maintenance and body parts, rely on distributors because they need to be able to provide services quickly to their customers, which requires them to offer a large and diversified product portfolio that can be supplied quickly, while holding little to no inventory. Providing the right part at the right place and right time is therefore critical to meeting our garage customers’ needs and we offer a distribution model based on proximity. Garages also need technical support with diagnostics, identification of parts and repair methods and the ordering of tools, and often require frequent training, as spare parts become more complex. We provide these services, replicating the types of programs that OEMs provide to their own networks, but expanding these services across the full range of light vehicles. Our online customers and key accounts have similar needs to those of garages: supplying their customers quickly with a large product assortment while having little to no capacity for inventory and storage. We meet these needs by offering up to two deliveries a day, with some deliveries undertaken within two hours of the order placement, through two dedicated logistics platforms, ACR and Doyen Auto. Customers generally select spare parts suppliers and distributors based on a number of factors, including product range and availability, service offering, price and services. Our distribution model, combined with the services we offer, is designed to match customers’ needs, leading to customer loyalty. (e.g. Bosch) Renault PSA 128 ----- Our services include: - _Best-in-class delivery times: Through our automated warehouses, we make deliveries to our customers up to six times per day and delivery times for some products can be as short as two to four hours from the time of order, with many other products being delivered within one day. - _Commercial support: Our service is strengthened by our partnership with the IDRAC business school, which helps select and integrate new sales teams, notably via apprenticeships. We created a tabletbased “e-book” that customers can use to view product details and instructional and support videos. We also provide customer service through our “Assistance Diag” call centers, which handled approximately 80 calls per day in 2019 for our 1,500 key users. Assistance Diag addresses 95% of the products we distribute and 450,000 technical issues, with nine hotlines that are specialized by carmakers. - _Training and technical support: We offer a range of technical support services to our customers, including, for example, a multi-brand diagnostic tool, Diag’issimo, which helps customers identify the source of product and systems breakdowns. We also offer comprehensive training opportunities. For example, our customers can benefit from dedicated training modules through “AD Academy.” In 2017, we acquired Grup Eina, a company based in Spain with call centers and staff dedicated to the French market, in order to enhance our digital support and training offerings, with practical trainings that address the increasing complexity of car maintenance, including simulations of data systems breakdowns. - _Strong commercial concept and integrated branding: Another key differentiating feature is our strong commercial concept and integrated branding. Our brands benefit from strong brand awareness among drivers. For example, according to an independent third-party survey conducted in France in 2017, the “Autodistribution” brand enjoys the highest brand awareness among our peers, with 92% brand awareness (of which, unprompted awareness of 74% and prompted awareness of 18%). The second ranking player in France had only 37% brand awareness. - _Business leads to key third-party providers: We partner with certain third-party providers, such as major insurers (such as Allianz, MAAF, Macif and AXA) and car fleets (such as AVIS, Europcar and Eiffage), which helps drive B2C (DIY) sales within our repairer customers’ networks. We manage these partnerships with four dedicated teams, employing 40 people, and, in 2019, handled approximately 500,000 requests, leading to approximately 40,000 services. We estimate that such partnerships drove approximately €278 million in business to our AD-branded garages and Mondial Pare-Brise customers in 2019. - _Online tools: We have developed online tools to support our customers with online ordering as well as other IT functions. For example, our proprietary online portal, Autossimo, processed more than 5,000 product orders per day in 2019. Autossimo improves customers’ experiences by offering a userfriendly portal for garages to search through a large selection of spare parts, directly order parts online and obtain technical information about those parts. Autossimo features approximately 2.48 million parts in our catalogue, supplied by 600 OEMs/OESs. In 2019, one-third of French garages were Autossimo customers and 24% of our orders were placed online (as compared with 12% in 2014). We also created ID Garages, which allows drivers to get a quote and schedule a service appointment online, driving business to our branded garages. We believe ID Garages are a “win-win” solution for us, allowing us to retain a percentage of the fee quote, and our suppliers and garages to collect fees from business gained through the portal. In 2019, ID Garages served more than 3,800 subscribers and 6 million unique web visitors, with an average of 4,500 bookings made per month via this portal in the fourth quarter of 2019. We estimate that ID Garages generated approximately €2.4 million in subscriptions and fees and drove approximately €8.0 million worth of business to our garage customers for the year ended December 31, 2019.",,as_expected,2020,482,

We have grown our light vehicle France segment organically and with strategic acquisitions such as the acquisitions of Gobillot Rhône (2012), Rougon Queyrel and FPLS (2013), ACR (2014) and Mondial Pare-Brise and Oocar (2017). 129 ----- In 2017, we had approximately 335,000 square meters of light vehicle spare parts storage capacity in France. In 2019, we were able to stock approximately 4,500,000 SKUs representing approximately 1,600 brands. Our light vehicle France network included 84 distributors and 3,156 branded and affiliated garages. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to light vehicle France Affiliated Distributors constituted 42% of the total light vehicle France sales. Furthermore, in 2019, branded garages represented more than 34.5% of the sales made by light vehicle France, followed by retail (approximately 12%), web dealers (approximately 1%) and key accounts (approximately 6%). Our light vehicle France distribution network in Benelux makes up to six deliveries per day, with delivery times as low as two hours. Our light vehicle France segment is supported by three logistics platforms: Logisteo, ACR and Cora. - Logisteo is our automated warehouse. It is a central platform that enables stock deliveries to French distributors once per day. Logisteo is located in Réau, France and represented a total cost of €26 million as of December 31, 2019. As of 2019, it was the largest independent logistics platform for light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France. It has over 38,000 square meters of storage space and stores approximately 120,000 SKUs (as compared with storage of approximately 55,000 SKUs before the implementation of Logisteo). Logisteo prepares approximately 60,000 lines per day (as compared with approximately 30,000 lines per day before the implementation of Logisteo) and completes approximately 3,000 orders per hour, serving approximately 500 local distributors. We estimate that Logisteo has driven a 30% improvement in productivity and that Logisteo supplies virtually all of our French light vehicle distribution locations and employs approximately 200 full-time employees (as of December 31, 2019, a reduction of approximately 100 full-time employees since the inception of Logisteo). Deliveries of regular orders are made before 8:00 a.m. arrive the next business day. Logisteo has also enabled us to consolidate our supply flows to a single delivery point, which permits us to offer a wide-range of constantly available products while capturing logistics fees from our suppliers that generally exceed our logistics costs, generating higher margins. - ACR is a specialized, automated platform that services our key accounts and online customers in France, with stock deliveries of light vehicle spare parts made two times per day and emergency deliveries made to wholesalers as needed.

Collectively, they have approximately 60,000 square meters of storage space and stock approximately 100,000 SKUs. _Benelux_ As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 37,000 square meters of storage capacity in Benelux that stocked approximately 90,000 SKUs representing more than 79 brands. Our network in Benelux included 409 distributors, including 98 Doyen Auto franchisees, more than 207 “1, 2, 3 Auto Service” garages and more than 114 Requal garages in 2019. Our distribution network in Benelux makes up to two deliveries per day, with delivery times under three hours. In the 2011 to 2019 period, the Doyen Auto Group’s revenue in Benelux grew organically at a CAGR of 4.6%. Revenue organic growth in the Netherlands is currently 7.1% per annum. In 2016, we acquired the Doyen Auto Group, giving us access to the Belgian and Dutch markets through Doyen Auto’s network of affiliated distributors (API) and two networks of branded garages (1,2,3 AutoService and Requal). The acquisition of the Doyen Auto Group also gave us exposure to the web dealer channel in Benelux and strengthened our position with web dealers in France and also expanded our market share in France through Doyen Auto Group’s light vehicle spare parts distribution operations in France. Doyen Auto’s activities are managed on an international level from Belgium. Since the acquisition of Doyen Auto, we have exported the 130 ----- Autodistribution concept, network and platforms to these new markets, while developing a complementary offer that targets differentiated customers (such as smaller distributors). In 2018, we acquired Geevers, an independent retailer of light vehicle spare parts in Benelux, which stocks over 100,000 spare body parts and offers approximately four million products, and Verviers Freins, a Belgian multi-brand distributor of mechanical parts, bodywork, paint, tools and garage equipment in the Liège region.

At the distribution level, we distribute products to garages and integrated workshops and we are able to make deliveries in under four hours around France. At the repair and maintenance level, we offer our services through a whollyowned network of garages. In 2019, our Trucks segment generated revenue, including all network sales, of €165.4 million. We benefit from a scale effect, holding 18% market share in the truck IAM in France in 2019 and managing a large network of approximately 228 locations (of which approximately 125 are service and distribution locations and approximately 103 are AD Poids Lourds-branded garages). 133 ----- The map below shows our truck spare parts distribution and repair network in France as of December 31, 2019. In recent years, our Trucks segment has experienced challenges due to difficult market conditions as well as a lack of truck spare parts specialization embedded in the light vehicle business, a lack of central focus and performance monitoring and underperforming locations. Over the 2015 to 2019 period, our Trucks segment revenue increased by 3.4%, from €160.0 million to €165.4 million. Our Trucks segment’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to €2.8 million and 1.8%, respectively, in 2015 and increased to €5.6 million and 3.4%, respectively, in 2019. Our value-added services approach for our Trucks segment is based on and adapted from the same approach we use in our light vehicle segments and includes: - _Best-in-class delivery times: We have approximately 10,000 square meters of dedicated logistics platform space for our Trucks segment and stores approximately 25,000 SKUs. - _Commercial support: We employ locally-based sales teams, comprising 121 professionals in 2019, of which 67 were commercial managers, 9 were sales managers, 7 were key accounts managers and 38 were call center managers or salespersons. - _Training and technical support: We run a training center, “Institut AD” and a technical support platform dedicated to our Trucks segment through a partnership with IMA Technologies. - _Strong commercial concept and integrated branding: As in our light vehicle segments, we employ an integrated, single brand approach in our Trucks segment, leading to strong lock-up of affiliates (both distributors and garages). AD Poids Lourds is a unique brand with the highest brand recognition (64% unprompted awareness) among independent players in France in 2019, with more than two times higher awareness than the number two player. Demonstrating the power of this brand awareness, we are a partner of choice for truck fleet operators and garages and there are early signs of success as measured by improved monthly revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2019. 134 ----- - _Business focus on key accounts: In 2019, 20% of our revenue in our Trucks segment was generated from national key accounts (such as Veolia and Geodis), with 60% of revenue in our Trucks segment generated from national and regional key accounts collectively. - _Online tools: We offer a dedicated online portal, Truckissimo, for our Trucks segment, which includes continuously updated technical databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use tool outlining repair methods and connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price comparison tools by brand and inventory access. We also offer our customers digital support through AD Connect. We also seek to capture upside from our partnership with Alltrucks, a joint venture created by OESs to establish a network of affiliated workshops. Founded in 2013 and present in ten countries as of 2018, Alltrucks offers our affiliated workshops exclusive multi-brand diagnostics and trainings, technical assistance and access to a pan-European workshop network. We benefit from our membership in Alltrucks, and our Level 2 accreditation with three OESs grants us an improved access to parts and gaining access to foreign truck operations that are active in France. Our Trucks segment is supported by one specialized, partially automated logistics platform, Bremstar. Bremstar was established in 1995 and was acquired by us in 2008.

In 2019, we served approximately 2.5 million customers in France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, received approximately 12,000 orders a day and offered a portfolio of approximately 1 million SKUs through Oscaro. Oscaro has a strong leadership in the growing French online light vehicle spare parts aftermarket with an approximate market share of over 47% in 2019, mainly due to its high brand awareness and customer loyalty. Since the completion of the acquisition, we implemented various initiatives following the acquisition of Oscaro to bring Oscaro back to profitability. These initiatives were successful, with Oscaro returning to profitability in third quarter of the year 2019 and reaching positive EBITDA for the full year 2019.

Unlike BER 2002, the New BER does not apply to the purchase, sale or resale of new motor vehicles, which are covered by Regulation 330/2010/EC. Accordingly, the material scope of the New BER is now limited to the distribution of spare parts and the provision of repair and maintenance services for motor vehicles. The New BER also applies to (i) the general EU competition law and (ii) the General Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (Commission Regulation (EU) n°330/2010 of April 20, 2010 on the Application of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices (the “General BER”)) and the corresponding EU Guidelines on Vertical Restraints. These provisions aim to ensure fair competition in these markets in order to safeguard that original and equivalent spare parts manufacturers competing with those branded by the light vehicle (referred to as “passenger cars” under the New BER) and truck (referred to as “commercial vehicles” under the New BER) manufacturers have full access to the market. Pursuant to these rules, agreements relating to the sale or distribution of light vehicle and truck spare parts and repair and maintenance services are exempted from the application of Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”), which prohibits anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices, if they comply with the provisions of both: - the General BER, which only applies if: (a) both parties have less than 30% of the market share in their respective markets; and (b) the agreement does not contain any of the hardcore restrictions provided in the General BER; and - the New BER, which implies that: (a) no restriction may be imposed on the business of independent garages by way of a selective distribution system under which a member of the network is prohibited from selling goods or services to independent garages; (b) no limitations may be imposed on any supplier of spare parts, repair tools, diagnostic or other equipment to freely sell such goods to independent or authorized distributors, garages or end-users; and (c) no restrictions may be imposed on suppliers of components for the initial assembly of motor vehicles limiting their ability to place their own trademark or logo effectively and easily on the components supplied or on spare parts. Furthermore, the European Commission may declare that both the General BER and the New BER are not applicable where parallel networks with similar competition restraints cover more than 50% of a relevant market. The agreements relating to the sale and distribution of spare parts that do not fulfill the conditions of the General BER and/or of the New BER (which, according to the European Commission, is likely to be the case for most agreements) may nonetheless benefit from an individual exemption if they fulfill the conditions provided in Article 101(3) of the TFEU. In this regard, however, notice no. 2010/C 138/05 (European Commission’s Supplementary Guidelines on Vertical Restraints in Agreements for the Sale and Repair of Vehicles and for the Distribution of Replacement Parts for Vehicles) (“notice 2010/C 138/05”), which provides some guidelines on the application and interpretation of the New BER, further specifies that it is very doubtful that selective distribution agreements that would contain any of the two following restrictions could benefit from an exemption under Article 101(3) of the TFEU: - failure for the motor vehicle manufacturer to provide independent operators (including independent repairers, spare parts manufacturers and distributors, manufacturers of repair equipment or tools, 140 ----- publishers of technical information, automobile clubs, roadside assistance operators, operators offering inspection and testing services, and operators offering training for repairers) with appropriate access to the brand-specific technical information required to perform repair and maintenance work on branded motor vehicles in fair competition with authorized garages and distributors; and - explicit or implicit reservation of repair services by the supplier to the members of its authorized network only. As Recital 69 of notice no. 2010/C 138/05 clarifies, the legal or extended warranty may not, for example, be conditioned either (i) on the obligation for the end-user to have the repair and maintenance services not covered by the warranty exclusively performed by a member of the network or (ii) on the obligation for the end- user to use spare parts branded by the manufacturer in respect of replacements not covered by the warranty. The foregoing provisions aim essentially to foster access to the repair and maintenance services marketed by independent garages and facilitate the identification of compatible spare parts of alternative suppliers, thereby fostering competition between such articles (known as “equivalent” parts) and those bearing the manufacturer’s trademark. As further specified by the European Commission in notice no. 2010/C 138/05, the New BER also aims to protect access by spare parts suppliers to the motor vehicle aftermarkets, thereby ensuring that competing brands of spare parts continue to be available to both independent and authorized repairers, as well as to parts wholesalers. The European Commission emphasizes that the availability of such spare parts entails significant advantages for consumers especially since there are often large differences in price between parts sold by the manufacturer and alternative parts. In particular, the following may be employed as substitutes for spare parts bearing the manufacturer’s trademark: (i) original parts manufactured and distributed by original equipment suppliers; and (ii) replacement parts of “equivalent quality” to the original components. In the same notice, the European Commission specifies that in order to be considered of “equivalent quality,” spare parts must be “of a sufficiently high quality that their use does not endanger the reputation of the authorized network” that employs them. The European Commission places the burden of proving that a part does not satisfy the requirements for being considered of “equivalent quality” on the vehicle manufacturer. In France, the New BER, as well as the General BER, are binding and directly applicable. Accordingly, the French courts and the French Competition Authority assess vertical agreements entered into in the sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts wholesale and repair and maintenance services in light of these regulations and of the corresponding guidelines.",,as_expected,2020,482,

With regard to light vehicles with fewer than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat) and trucks permitted to operate up to 3.5 tons, Directive 2014/45/EU requires inspections to be made (i) four years after the first utilization and (ii) every two years thereafter. With regard to light vehicles with more than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat), trucks authorized to carry more than 3.5 tons, taxis and ambulances, such controls must be performed within one year from the first utilization and every year thereafter. In France, the requirements set forth in Directive 2014/45/EU have been provided for in the French Highway Code since 2004. If vehicles are not inspected when due, pecuniary penalties can be imposed and may be increased for repeated violation or for vehicles on the road that were suspended as a result of the inspection and may also entail the impoundment of the vehicle or the confiscation of the vehicle registration certificate (Articles R.323-1 et seq. of the French Highway Code).",,as_expected,2020,482,

In France, according to the French Intellectual Property Code, the distribution of “visible” parts (such as wings, bumpers and windscreens) is protected by industrial design rights (Articles L-511-1 and seq. of the French Intellectual Property Code). Consequently, only the manufacturer has the right to distribute these parts to various repairers.

Drawing under the PGE Loan is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the publication of a decision (arreˆte´ ministe´riel) by the French government to confirm the guarantee of the loan by the French State. We cannot guarantee that the French government will issue this arreˆte´ _ministe´riel and that we will be able to draw on the PGE Loan. The PGE Loan will remain outstanding following_ the completion of the Refinancing. 150 ----- The obligations under the PGE Loan are guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by the Collateral. In addition, the French State guarantees up to 80% of the principal, interest, penalties and otherwise (capital, _intérêts et accessoires) with respect to the PGE Loan.

In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (but no more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent, unless such notice was sent in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Alternate Offer, in which case the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed by more than 60 days) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer to purchase that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice” below. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on _Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in_ principal amount of all the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Senior Secured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Senior Secured Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially _all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to_ whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived with the consent of Holders holding 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding under the Indenture)) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense caused by taking or not taking such action. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of 220 ----- any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction in its sole discretion. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",,as_expected,2020,482,

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take action in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. We understand that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

This summary is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the French tax considerations that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular circumstances. Furthermore, this summary does not address any French estate or gift tax considerations. Prospective investors in the Notes are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors as to the French tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Notes in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, Article 1649 AC of the French Tax Code imposes on financial institutions within the meaning of Article 1 of Decree n°2016-1683 to review and collect information on their clients and investors, in order to identify their tax residence, as well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign tax authorities (via the French tax authorities) on an annual basis.",,as_expected,2020,482,

In such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the indenture governing the Notes. Such a modification to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain beneficial owners of the Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Note for a New Note would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note will equal the fair market value of such Note or such New Note at the time of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, such Note or such New Note were considered “publicly traded” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the IPO Pushdown generally will commence on the day after the IPO Pushdown, and tax basis in such New Note would generally equal the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss recognized as a result of such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of a Note.” If the issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at maturity by more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders would be required to include that original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any. 267 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.67,Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations,58.67.2,Characterization of the Notes,"We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes”) or make additional payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to treat the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes, as not resulting in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. holder that receives an interest payment in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. An accrual basis U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, an accrual basis U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of receipt) in respect of an accrual period and the amount previously accrued during such accrual period (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.67,Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations,58.67.4,Original Issue Discount,"The Notes will be treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the issue price of the Notes is less than their stated principal amount by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily 268 ----- defined de minimis amount (1/4 of 1 percent of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date). If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on a Note, a U.S. holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. The amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. holder holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” (other than the initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will equal (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less (b) the stated interest on the Notes allocable to the accrual period. The “yield to maturity” is the discount rate that, when applied to all payments under a Note as of its issue date, results in a present value equal to the Note’s issue price. The amount of OID allocable to any initial short accrual period generally may be computed under any reasonable method. The amount of OID allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount of the Note and the adjusted issue price of the Note at the beginning of the final accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note as of the beginning of any accrual period generally will equal its issue price, increased by previously accrued OID. Under these rules, a U.S. holder of a Note generally will be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. A U.S. holder may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on any Note as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the method described above. The election must be made for the taxable year in which the U.S. holder acquires the Note and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors about this election. A U.S. holder of Notes must (i) determine OID allocable to each accrual period in euro using the constant yield method described above, and (ii) translate the amount into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above under “— _Payments of Interest.”._ A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when an amount attributable to accrued OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on an Additional Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Interest and accrued OID on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances.

The adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase increased by any previously accrued OID. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders with regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss that a U.S. holder recognizes on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S.-source capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such holder has held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss, respectively, and generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest, and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed under “ —Interest.” or “ —Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The amount of gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on the sale or other disposition of such foreign currency for U.S. dollars will be equal to the difference between (1) the amount of U.S. dollars and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency. Upon any subsequent exchange of such foreign currency for property, a U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between (1) the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency paid for such property based on the spot rate of exchange for such foreign currency on the date of the exchange and (2) the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the foreign currency so exchanged. As discussed above, if the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (or an electing accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition. A U.S. holder that purchases a Note with previously owned foreign currency will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency and the U.S. dollar fair market value of such note on the date of purchase.

However, under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations issued in December 2018 (and upon which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued), such withholding does not apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified more than six months after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.

The option for this levy must cover all interest payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial owner during the entire civil year. The Luxembourg resident individual who is the beneficial owner of interest is responsible for the declaration and the payment of such final levy. An individual Luxembourg holder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the Notes, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the Relibi Law. 272 ----- Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realized upon the sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes by a Luxembourg holder, who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the acquisition of the Notes and the Notes do not constitute zero coupon notes. An individual Luxembourg holder, who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes, must further include the portion of the gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income in respect of the Notes in his/ her taxable income, insofar as the accrued but unpaid interest is indicated separately in the agreement, except if a final withholding tax or levy has been levied in accordance with the Relibi Law. Luxembourg resident individual holders acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking to which the Notes are attributable, must include any interest received or accrued, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in any form whatsoever, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax and municipal business tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed. _Luxembourg resident companies_ Luxembourg corporate holders must include any payments, on the Notes received from the Issuer or the Guarantor (except repayments of nominal), as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax and municipal business tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed. _Luxembourg resident companies benefiting from a special tax regime_ Luxembourg holders who benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for example, undertakings for collective investment subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010, specialized investment funds governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, family wealth management companies governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007, or reserved alternative investment fund treated as specialized investment funds for Luxembourg tax purposes governed by the amended law of July 23, 2016 are exempt from income taxes in Luxembourg and thus income derived from the Notes as well as gains realized thereon, are not subject to income taxes.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which became fully effective on June 26, 2017 (except with respect to the obligation of the Member States to establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings that came into on June 26, 2018, and the obligation of the European Commission to interconnect such registers that will come into force on June 26, 2019) and applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the centre of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” 275 ----- Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex _fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency practitioners. It also provides for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group. As from June 26, 2018, the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings and, as from June 26, 2019, the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Insolvency test","Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to pay its due debts with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria. The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see below). Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020, as modified by Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, modified the above test and provides that, until 23 August 2020 included, the insolvency test above will be considered in light of the debtor’s situation on 12 March 2020, absent fraud. As a result of this change, debtors who, absent these two Ordinances, would have met the insolvency test above between 13 March 2020 and 23 August 2020 are not required (but still have the ability) to file for insolvency proceedings within 45 days, which means that such debtors would still have access to court-assisted proceedings and safeguard proceedings as described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, debtors may petition for judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings during the period between 13 March 2020 and 23 August 2020 should they meet the insolvency test, prior to its modification by Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020 as modified. 277 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

In practice,_ mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law. They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law. They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur being able to request a one- month extension). The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so for their duration and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the 278 ----- rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above, except that in addition: - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien (as defined herein) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court; - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-proceedings claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate); - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is transmitted to its statutory auditors; and - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency test”), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined herein—see “—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and _liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval_ (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in the case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de _l’accord) during its execution, and while the agreement is in force:_ - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article L.611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code and pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods”), in relation to claims of creditors (other than public creditors) party to the conciliation proceedings that are not already subject to the conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliateur (provided that the terms of his or her appointment included monitoring the implementation of the agreement, as referred to above); and - a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation proceedings. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or forbidden. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will be a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the conciliation proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or 279 ----- total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) which could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad _hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or_ liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, have modified conciliation proceedings to provide that: 1. the duration of conciliation proceedings is increased by five months, thereby increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of 5 months previously); 2. until 31 December 2020, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings: - the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment default; - the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have become final; or - the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim. In addition, the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—France—Grace periods” above) even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to_ attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court- appointed administrator and overseen by the court. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. 280 ----- If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_ representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert such proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) after commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) before commencement of the proceedings, (ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own initiative or upon request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in the case where the debtor is insolvent, or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end. At any time during the observation period, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: (i) the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) above, the court may act upon its own initiative; and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020, modified safeguard proceedings to provide that: - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 provides for a new safeguard or reorganization privilege (the “S/R Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between 22 May 2020 and the earlier of the date of implementation of EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023 dated 20 June 2019 and 17 July 2021. The S/R Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted after commencement of the proceedings, with the approval of the bankruptcy judge, after for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period. - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person: (a) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge, or (b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e. within the plan as approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts. - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. - Such claims may be not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. 281 ----- _Standard consultation: This applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or_ prepared by a chartered accountant, or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less. In such a case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court- appointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in the situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum possible length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it, except when the proposal includes debt for equity swap. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were_ submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. _Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, the accounts of which are certified by a_ statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor, but excluding noteholders (the “credit institutions committee”); and - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations. As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee. 282 ----- The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the creditors may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare an alternative safeguard plan that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the bondholders’ general meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan. The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). Each member of a creditors’ committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The courtappointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors’ committees/ bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the courtappointed administrator. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan or take part in the vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting are consulted in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above. If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. 283 ----- If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the bondholders’ general meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the State prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. With regard to indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those: - which publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or - which publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3.0 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 provides that only the publication of consolidated accounts as provided for above will be required for proceedings commenced between 22 May 2020 and the earlier of the date of implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023 dated 20 June 2019 and 17 July 2021, the above mentioned thresholds will no longer be required. If the debtor does not exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above), the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision. To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a month following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (that can be extended by an additional month). While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan 284 ----- through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor. Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committeebased consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde _accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and_ creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “committee-based consultation”)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 provides that for proceedings commenced between 22 May 2020 and the earlier of the date of implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive 2019/1023 dated 20 June 2019 and 17 July 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).",,as_expected,2020,482,

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability in the event that judicial liquidation proceedings should be subsequently commenced against the debtor. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order 285 ----- the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the State prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor with the debtor’s help, or for the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court- appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “France—Court-administered Proceedings— _Safeguard”).In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the_ shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then following (x) the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor and (y) at least three months have elapsed from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital increase and holding, 286 ----- directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholders’ meetings; the minority shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: (a) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going concern via an asset sale, i.e. a sale plan (plan de cession), any third party being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business); or (b) a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (i) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); (ii) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (iii) in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility of implementing such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of 287 ----- conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), which runs from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void while others are voidable by the court. - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of matured debts in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for previously incurred obligations, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made by way of security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the creditor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the courtappointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its contractual obligations post-filing (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (a) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred for at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (b) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business); 288 ----- (c) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor; (d) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed within one year of the expiration of the observation period; (e) creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (i) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (ii) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (iii) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (x) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (v) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable—is located in another EU Member State, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation; and (f) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en _cours), will be required._ A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de _redressement”)._ In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors who fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors on whose behalves no claims have been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all of its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proofs of claim. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two- or four-months’ time limit). Creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. 289 ----- If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from extending credit or guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors which are subsidiaries of the Issuer and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the Guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The liens on 290 ----- the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte de titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de _mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor.

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",,as_expected,2020,482,

This new regime applies to security agents appointed after 1st October 2017. New Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code. 291 ----- The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be provided for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) that mirror the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default (each as defined therein), and acts as trustee in the interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_ n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, inter alia, the Security Agent. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee or the Security Agent.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to 292 ----- which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of such debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or by any of the creditors of such debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests that are not registered, in official ledgers such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered. Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers _convenu” (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the_ creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking secured parties. This structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event. 293 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Luxembourg insolvency laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be commenced against a company with a registered office in Luxembourg having its COMI in Luxembourg or an establishment in Luxembourg within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation (in relation to secondary proceedings): - insolvency proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may commence insolvency proceedings if the Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may open insolvency proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon foreclosure of the assets; - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings; or - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the company (subject to obtaining the prior consent of the majority of its creditors holding 75% at least of the claims against such company) and not by its creditors themselves. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors. In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Law”). The management of such liquidation proceedings generally will follow rules similar to those applicable to insolvency proceedings. Liability of the Issuer in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of such Issuer following insolvency or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg revenue authorities; - value-added taxes and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg customs and excise authorities; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. 294 ----- For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is foreclosed upon), and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law. Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the period before insolvency, or the suspect period (période suspecte), which is a maximum of six months from the date on which the Luxembourg Commercial Court formally adjudicates a person insolvent and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment declaring insolvency, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the insolvency judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law. In particular: - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), specified transactions (such as the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts that have not fallen due; whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by a bill of exchange; or the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the insolvent party’s cessation of payments; - regardless of the suspect period, Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the insolvency; and - pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”), a financial collateral arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it. In principle, an insolvency order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the insolvency order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of insolvency, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the insolvency estate. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and on the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes. The insolvency receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the insolvency order). The insolvency receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the insolvency receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of an insolvency constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts where the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the insolvency judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. 295 ----- The insolvency receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the insolvent party that are still to be performed after the insolvency under any agreement validly entered into by the insolvent party prior to the insolvency. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the insolvency and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract. International aspects of Luxembourg insolvency, controlled management or voluntary arrangement with creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where a company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the majority of a company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where a company has its COMI. The time when a company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the COMI of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If a company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the Issuer’s COMI is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such other jurisdictions may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Issuer.",,as_expected,2020,482,

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank account held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities that are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event: 296 ----- - the direct appropriation of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets; - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions _commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public auction;_ - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under the Luxembourg Collateral Law and the powers of any receivers or administrators, might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, particularly where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (such as social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.",,as_expected,2020,482,

A valid judgment against an issuer incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the Notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect after all appeals that may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur) set forth in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile), being: - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi); - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matters under its applicable rules, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; - the judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which the decision has been rendered; - the judgment was obtained in compliance with the rights of the defendant, i.e., following proceedings at which the defendant had the opportunity to appear, was granted the necessary time to prepare its case and, if it appeared, could present a defense; and - the judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature. If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law and notably if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international public policy. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Furthermore, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have the power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay in a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro. 298 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,854,ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS,854.1,France,854.1.1,,"The Issuer and the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or principal places of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French entities and/or French individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment 307 ----- should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French and European data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as amended and Regulation (EU) 2016/479 of April 27, 2016) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent that an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contact with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, regarding legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the European Union. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.",,as_expected,2020,482,
1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,854,ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS,854.2,Luxembourg,854.2.1,,"The Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated and established under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. All of their assets are located outside the United States. Furthermore, none of their directors or managers resides in the United States. As a result, investors may find it difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons or to enforce outside the U.S. judgments obtained against the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons in U.S. courts, including 308 ----- judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Likewise, it may also be difficult for an investor to enforce U.S. courts’ judgments obtained against the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons in courts located in jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. It may also be difficult for an investor to bring an original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons. Luxembourg law, furthermore, does not recognize a shareholder’s right to bring a derivative action on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore, a contractual provision allowing the service of process against a party to a service agent could be overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process against a party in accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party. The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. According to Luxembourg case law, a judgment rendered in respect of the Notes by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York would be recognized and enforced by a Luxembourg court, without reconsideration of the merits, subject to the following conditions: - the judgment of the U.S. court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction according to the Luxembourg conflict of jurisdiction rules; - the U.S. court must have applied to the matter submitted to it the proper law designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (although some first instance decisions rendered in Luxembourg, which have not been confirmed by the Luxembourg Court of Appeals, no longer apply this condition); - the judgment of the U.S. court must not have been obtained fraudulently, and must have been made in compliance with procedural rules of the country in which it was rendered and, in particular, the rights of the defendant; and - the judgment of the U.S. court must not be contrary to Luxembourg public policy. The enforcement in Luxembourg of a judgment rendered in respect of the Indenture or the Notes by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York will be subject to the rules of civil and commercial procedure as applied by the courts of Luxembourg. The term “enforceable” as used above is subject to all limitations by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, controlled management, general settlement with creditors, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors of the Issuer generally. Furthermore, a foreign jurisdiction clause does not prevent the parties from initiating legal action in Luxembourg courts to the extent that summary proceedings (référé) seeking urgent provisional measures are concerned. Finally, notwithstanding a foreign governing law clause, Luxembourg courts would in principle have jurisdiction over any urgent provisional measures in connection with assets located in Luxembourg and such action would most likely be governed by Luxembourg law. 309 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes are governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law. Some of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and those of their respective directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, the Guarantors or a security provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions in which the relevant company has assets.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,2928,DELOITTE & ASSOCIES,2928.3,Statutory auditors’ review report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements,2928.3.1,,"To the President, In our capacity as statutory auditors of Parts Holding Europe and in accordance with your request, we have performed a review of the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period from January 1 to March 31, 2020. We highlight that we have not audited or reviewed the corresponding figures relating to the period from January 1 to March 31, 2019. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were prepared under your responsibility on June 29, 2020 on the basis of the information available at that date in the evolving context of the health crisis related to Covid-19 and the challenges in assessing its impact and future developments. Our role is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the professional guidance issued by the French institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des _commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement. A review of interim financial information consists of_ making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34—standard of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information. This report shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with French law. The courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or difference concerning the engagement letter or this report, and any matter arising from them. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to object to an action being brought in any of those courts, to claim that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum or to claim that those courts do not have jurisdiction.

The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the supplier level and each supplier is identified as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing truck parts only, providing LV International parts only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV France, Truck and LV International parts, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are further split based on the pro-rata value of the mix of products purchased. In addition to the four segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are directly attributable to one of these segments.

At this stage, these events have a short-term impact on our operations due to the uncertainty about the duration of the measures implemented and the catch-up effect to be anticipated over the rest of the 2020 financial year. Furthermore, we do not anticipate any major impact in the medium term, particularly in the time frame of our strategic plan. In order to structurally protect the Group and our employees, the following action plan has been taken: - partial unemployment measures, depending on local situations. - implementation, for each country, of government support, including taxes and social security charges delays. - renewal confidence with our banks. - implementation of punctual financing guaranteed by the different countries. - daily monitoring of cash disbursements to the most vulnerable of our partners. In addition, the group has a very good level of cash, enabling it to largely meet its short-term maturities. The Group therefore remains confident in its ability to overcome the negative impacts of this health crisis and then resume normal activities as soon as the pandemic is over, without assuming its duration. Since the end of the lockdown, Group activity gradually recovers in European countries in which the Group operates. However, protective measures took in March still apply during the whole 1[st] semester to structurally protect our company. Strategic middle term plan has not been reassessed as hypothesis are still uncertain but management remains confident thanks to lower public transportation utilization and increasing car parc age. Refinancing are currently being negotiated in all countries, Group taking advantage of all governmental measures to preserve business continuity.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. F-30 ----- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements. Assesses the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates are made based on a going concern assumption and on information available at the date of their preparation. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations about future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. When the Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future, the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are: - Inventory impairment—Note 7.3 - End-of-year supplier rebates—Note 7.6 - Employee costs and benefits—Note 8 - Impairment of non-financial assets—Note 9.1 and 9.2 - Deferred tax assets—Notes 13.2",,as_expected,2020,482,

These changes become effective from 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 has a substantial impact on the financial statements of lessees of property and high value equipment—requiring that leases be placed on-balance sheet by recognising a ‘right-of-use’ asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. In the income statement, this standard application results in a amortisation and interest expenses recognition. The group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, without cumulative effects in equity as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the current period. Prior periods have not been restated. F-41 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

Control is assessed as having (i) the power over the investee through voting rights or similar rights, (ii) exposure to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and (iii) the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. Controlled entities are consolidated from the date the Group obtains control until such time the Group ceases to exercise control. All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealized income, expenses, gains and losses that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal transactions are eliminated. In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in an entity already controlled by the Group, the difference between the acquisition price of the shares and the additional interest acquired by the Group in consolidated equity is recorded in stockholders’ equity. The value of the entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including goodwill) for consolidation purposes remains unchanged. Entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not have control, are accounted for using the equity method. The investments in such entities are initially recognized at cost, including the goodwill of the acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss, and is subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the profit or loss in the investee. In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in entities that were previously accounted for using the equity method that results in the Group obtaining control, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at fair value and the difference between the fair value and carrying value is recorded as a gain or loss in the income statement. When the parent company loses control of a previously consolidated entity, assets and liabilities related to such entity is derecognized including any goodwill and a gain or loss associated with the loss of control of the former entity is recognized.",,as_expected,2020,482,

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s identifiable assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 9.1 for impairment of goodwill. Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities related to acquisitions recorded on a provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a maximum 12 months of the acquisition date. After the end of the allocation period, the effects are recorded directly in the income statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors. IFRS 10 on Consolidated Financial Statements presents a single consolidation model and provides a definition of control that includes: Power over the entity Exposure, or right, to variable returns of the entity, The ability to use its power to impact the amount of its returns Basically a shareholder has control over the entity when it owns more than 50% of the voting rights. IFRS 10 states that an investor may control an entity with less than 50% of the voting rights and provides specific guidance for assessing control in such situations. In accordance with IFRS 10, in the case where the shareholder has the practical capacity to exercise its substantive voting rights and in the case where such rights are exercisable; these rights must be taken into account when calculating the percentage of control.

At the end of 2018, after the acquisition of Oscaro, the Group added specific monitoring of its digital BtoC activities. The chief operating decision maker of the Group monitors profitability by revenue and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure which is further defined in the section “Use of adjusted EBITDA” of this note, and by the following operating segments: - The Light Vehicles (“LV”) France reportable segment, including headquarter costs attributable to the LV France segment. - The Trucks reportable segment, including headquarters costs attributable to the Trucks segment. - The LV International reportable segment, which includes the following entities: (i) Belgian Doyen Group (ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies since May 2017 and those acquired in 2018 (iii) Geevers group since its acquisition in 2018 (iv) AD Bosch Group in Spain, acquired on 31 July 2019. - The Digital BtoC reportable segment created in 2018 includes Oscaro acquired in the current year. The central purchasing unit (“CPU”) negotiates purchasing conditions for LV France, Trucks and LV International, which are then sold to wholly owned distributors and to affiliated independent distributors. As part of the new segmentation, the CPU’s income statement is now broken down between the four segments. This breakdown is primarily based on the detailed supplier analysis. The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the supplier level and each supplier was identified as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing truck parts only, providing LV International parts only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV France, Truck and LV International parts, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were further split based on the pro-rata value of the mix of products purchased. In addition to the four segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are directly attributable to one of these segments. Costs that cannot be attributed to one of the segments are presented in the “Headquarters” column.

The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as an expense. - Defined benefit plans: In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement benefits. These plans are largely unfunded. Actuarial gains and losses from valuation of these plans are recognized immediately in equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans. Significant judgements and estimates An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under the defined benefit plans annually using the projected unit credit method. These calculations include demographic actuarial assumptions concerning mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections. Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate with reference to the yield on investment-grade bonds. The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations.

Goodwill is tested where there are indications of impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less than the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference. For the purpose of the impairment test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities of a cashgenerating unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs. A CGU is a homogeneous group of assets whose continued use generates cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Significant judgements and estimates The impairment test consists of measuring the CGU’s recoverable amount and comparing it to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The value in use of a CGU is determined as the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from said assets based on the economic conditions and the operating assumptions made by the Group management.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met. In accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”, development expenses are are capitalized as an intangible asset when the following criteria are met: - the technical feasibility of the project is demonstrated; - the intention exists to finish the project and use or sell the products created during the project; - the ability to use or sell the products created during the project is demonstrated; - a potential market for the products created during the project exists or their usefulness, in case of internal use, is demonstrated, leading one to believe that the project will generate probable future economic benefits; - adequate resources are available to complete the project; and - the expenditure attributable to the project during its development phase can be reliably measured. Compliant with IAS 38, research expenses, or development expenses that do not meet the criteria set out above, are recorded as expenses in the year in which they are incurred. Intangible assets with a finite useful life Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives for accounting purposes and are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s function. The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise Movex accounting software licenses, as well as capitalized development costs. Amortization begins when the asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful life: Software (licences) 5 years Capitalized development costs 2 to 5 years Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a year on 31 December, either individually or at the level of the CGU to which they belong, and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Impairment After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. The assets are tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its net carrying amount, where the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent on the cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset. An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously identified indication of impairment has decreased or no longer exists. In this case, the Group estimates the recoverable amount and an impairment loss previously recorded is reversed to the asset’s recoverable amount. When an impairment loss is reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortization, had no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss reversal is recorded in the income statement. F-64 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

In the ordinary course of its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating to industrial disputes, commercial disputes, etc. In such cases, in conjunction with its legal advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the disputes and assesses the probability that an outflow of resources will be required to settle them. When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an insurance policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of any refunds. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a current rate before tax, which reflects the risks specific to the liability. When the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial expense. Changes in current provisions are as follows:",,as_expected,2020,482,

Their claim is for approximately €2.4 million. No provision was booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019. The Commercial Court handed down a judgment on 23 March 2017 that exonerated Gadest and Autodistribution, and retained the potential liability of three other subsidiaries, adding that the €0.3 million in compensation is secured by Klarius’ English parent companies in collective proceedings. This judgement is not enforceable. In this context, Group confirms its historical position and consider that the probability of an outflow of resources has not been demonstrated, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the lawsuit. An appeal in “cassation” was formulated on October 11, 2018 by the liquidator of Klarius. The Group is therefore awaiting briefs and a date for oral argument.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The financial asset is classified in its entirety and is not subject to complex rules of decomposition. Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets should be classified and measured: - the business model of the entity for the management of financial assets, and - the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial asset. For a financial asset in the scope of IFRS 9, there are 3 types of economic models: - If the objective of the business model is exclusively to hold financial assets to cash out contractual cash flows: the financial asset is measured at amortized cost. - If the objective of the business model is both to hold financial assets to cash out in contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets: the financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss. - If financial assets that are not held in any of the two business models above are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Group’s financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and in the category of financial assets measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are recognized over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortized issue costs are presented as a deduction from the liabilities to which they relate. Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized through the amortized cost mechanism. Fair value IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as effective for as of 1 July 2014, establishes a fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels: Level 1: prices on the valuation date for identical instruments to those being valued, quoted on an active market to which the entity has access; Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs; F-69 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Significant judgements and estimates The calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of tax management strategies. Recognized deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s six-year business plan for the year ended 31 December 2017 and of five-year business plan for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it no longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some or all of said deferred tax assets can be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized if it becomes likely that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.

This tax consolidation group’s tax loss carry-forwards were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an expanded base in 2019. There is also a French tax consolidation group whose parent company is Parts Holding Europe and which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax base (previously consolidated with Parts Europe for tax purposes). In 2019, the fiscal group’s result is—€3.6 million. In 2018, it was nil. According to French Finance Act of 2013, effective as of 31 December 2012, loss carry-forward is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount. Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the tax loss carry-forwards. The result obtained is then included in the Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also applies. A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the six-year business plan for France to determine the future utilization of tax loss carry-forwards in light of existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognized in the financial statements at 31 December 2019. This exercise shows that €208.0 million in tax loss carry-forwards would be utilized, i.e., a tax saving of €57.3 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of the business plan, the deferred tax asset recognized in the financial statements was limited to this amount. At 31 December 2019, tax loss carry-forwards, after utilizing €34 million in 2019, stood at €83.8 million for the expanded base and €287.3 million for the Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group in France. No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse in the long term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2020 budget and the five-year business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax assets after the said period, except as a deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the reporting date. At 31 December 2019, unrecognized tax loss carry-forwards amounts to €153.0 million. F-78 -----",,as_expected,2020,482,

Indeed, our services allow the maintenance of mobility which has been recognized by the government as essential, even if its exercise is limited. Our platforms and distributors are required to deliver spare parts to the entire light vehicles and trucks repair sector, including our own network. They are involved in repairing vehicles potentially used by medical staff or vehicles transporting them. Similarly, workshops can also be required to repair trucks, essential for supplying stores with foodstuffs, and vehicles of people involved in all activities which are recognised as essential, to ensure their mobility. In this period of public transport understandable restriction, a certain number of our fellow citizens—the medical staff but also the bakeries and supermarkets employees, retirement homes staff, cleaning staff, food distribution platforms and transport companies employees and many more—must move in compliance with the rules set by the public authorities. They require spare parts needed to repair their vehicles. Keep on providing them with our service means contributing, as a responsible and civic company, to the functioning of the country.

At this stage, these events have a short-term impact on our operations due to the uncertainty about the duration of the measures implemented and the catch-up effect to be anticipated over the rest of the 2020 financial year. Furthermore, we do not anticipate any major impact in the medium term, particularly in the time frame of our strategic plan. In order to structurally protect the Group and our employees, the following action plan has been taken: - partial unemployment measures, depending on local situations. - implementation, for each country, of government support, including taxes and social security charges delays. - renewal confidence with our banks. - implementation of punctual financing guaranteed by the different countries. - daily monitoring of cash disbursements to the most vulnerable of our partners. In addition, the group has a very good level of cash, enabling it to largely meet its short-term maturities. The group therefore remains confident in its ability to overcome the negative impacts of this health crisis and then resume normal activities as soon as the pandemic is over, without assuming its duration.",,as_expected,2020,482,

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Note 3.3 “Significant judgements and estimates” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements outlines the accounting method used by your company in terms of inventory impairment, year-end rebates received from suppliers, staff expenses and benefits, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and deferred tax assets, and the methods that involve estimates. We have assessed the reasonableness of these estimates. We also verified that this note to the consolidated financial statement provides appropriate information. F-89 ----- At each closing, the group conducts an impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, and also assesses whether there is any indication of impairment of long-term assets value, as described in notes 9.1 and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements. We reviewed how this impairment test was implemented, the data and assumptions used, and the calculations performed by the group.

1897,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,3292,CONSTANTIN ASSOCIES,3292.9,Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,3292.9.1,,"Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. F-90 ----- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets.

IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and will result in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 is effective for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 has also been applied. The Group plans to adopt IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019. Starting from this date, the standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise on the assets side, a right of use and as a liability, the rental obligation (sum of future discounted payments). The right of use will be amortized over the term of the lease agreements. Leases related to the vehicle fleet and leases related to real estate assets (buildings, platforms) entered into by the Group fall within the scope of this standard. At December 31, 2018, the Group mainly holds buildings, vehicles, IT and machinery equipments. In 2018, the Group identified and analysed all contracts which fall under the IFRS16 scope and finalized the analysis of potential impacts. During this period, the Group set up a new tool to facilitate the registration of contracts related to IFRS 16 and to monitor the contracts evolution. The expected impact on the Group’s debt as at the date of transition is between € 170 million and € 180 million.

Controlled entities are consolidated from the date the Group obtains control until such time the Group ceases to exercise control. All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealized income, expenses, gains and losses that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal transactions are eliminated. In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in an entity already controlled by the Group, the difference between the acquisition price of the shares and the additional interest acquired by the Group in consolidated equity is recorded in stockholders’ equity. The value of the entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities (including goodwill) for consolidation purposes remains unchanged. Entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not have control, are accounted for using the equity method. The investments in such entities are initially recognized at cost, including the goodwill of the acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss, and is subsequently adjusted for the Group’s share of the profit or loss in the investee. In the event of an acquisition of additional shares in entities that were previously accounted for using the equity method that results in the Group obtaining control, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at fair value and the difference between the fair value and carrying value is recorded as a gain or loss in the income statement.

Each reportable segment is an operating segment identified in accordance with paragraphs 5-10 of IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”. The chief operating decision maker is responsible for managing resources and assessing the profitability of each operating segment. The chief operating decision maker of the Group was identified as the Chairman of the Group in charge of strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker does not review information regarding the Group’s assets and liabilities. Since the beginning of 2017, the Group’s management has further aligned its internal reporting structure to its strategic allowing improved monitoring of the Group’s two operating units in France (Light Vehicles and Trucks) and its international operations in the rest of Western Europe. At the end of 2018, after the acquisition of Oscaro, the Group added specific monitoring of its digital BtoC activities. The chief operating decision maker of the Group monitors profitability by revenue and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure which is further defined in the section “Use of adjusted EBITDA” of this note, and by the following operating segments: - The Light Vehicles (“LV”) France reportable segment, including headquarter costs attributable to the LV France segment. - The Trucks reportable segment, including headquarters costs attributable to the Trucks segment. - The LV International reportable segment, which includes the following entities: (i) Belgian Doyen Group (ii) Autodis Italia, which owns several acquired Italian companies since May 2017 and those acquired in 2018 (iii) Geevers group since its acquisition in 2018. - The Digital BtoC reportable segment created in 2018 includes Oscaro acquired in the current year. The central purchasing unit (“CPU”) negotiates purchasing conditions for LV France, Trucks and LV International, which are then sold to wholly owned distributors and to affiliated independent distributors. As part of the new segmentation, the CPU’s income statement is now broken down between the four segments. This breakdown is primarily based on the detailed supplier analysis. The CPU’s revenue and margin are tracked at the supplier level and each supplier was identified as either those providing LV France parts only, those providing truck parts only, providing LV International parts only, or providing all of the segments. For those providing LV France, Truck and LV International parts, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA were further split based on the pro-rata value of the mix of products purchased. In addition to the four segments identified above, the Group also has the headquarter function, whose activities and the support functions are partially allocated to the LV France and Trucks segments when costs are directly attributable to one of these segments. Costs that cannot be attributed to one of the segments are presented in the “Headquarters” column. The recoverable amount of goodwill is monitored at the level of each segment (see Note 9.1).

These plans are largely unfunded. Actuarial gains and losses from valuation of these plans are recognized immediately in equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans. Significant judgements and estimates An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under the defined benefit plans annually using the projected unit credit method. These calculations include demographic actuarial assumptions concerning mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections. Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate with reference to the yield on investment-grade bonds. The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions such as the discount, salary increase, staff turnover and mortality rates.

Goodwill is tested where there are indications of impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less than the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference. For the purpose of the impairment test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities of a cashgenerating unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs. A CGU is a homogeneous group of assets whose continued use generates cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Significant judgements and estimates The impairment test consists of measuring the CGU’s recoverable amount and comparing it to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

As indicated in Note 6.3, the Group’s management uses the key performance indicator adjusted EBITDA to monitor the synergies arising from acquisitions at segment level. In 2018, the goodwill was allocated and tested following the following segments: - CGU LV Frances; - CGU Trucks; - CGU LV International. _Determination of the recoverable value_ Amortization begins when the asset is available for use, ie when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful life: Software (licences) 5 years Capitalized development costs 2 to 5 years Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least once a year on 31 December, either individually or at the level of the CGU to which they belong, and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Impairment After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. The assets are tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its net carrying amount, where the recoverable amount is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent on the cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset. An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously identified indication of impairment has decreased or no longer exists. In this case, the Group estimates the recoverable amount and an impairment loss previously recorded is reversed to the asset’s recoverable amount. When an impairment loss is reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortization, had no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss reversal is recorded in the income statement. Significant judgements and estimates The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a year at the reporting date. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually at the reporting date in order to determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment is still justified. If it is not, the change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively. For the purpose of impairment testing, value in use is determined using the projected future cash flows based on the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee, discounted by applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less costs to sell.

In the ordinary course of its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating to industrial disputes, commercial disputes, etc. In such cases, in conjunction with its legal advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the disputes and assesses the probability that an outflow of resources will be required to settle them. When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an insurance policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of any refunds. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a current rate before tax, which reflects the risks specific to the liability. When the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial expense. Changes in current provisions are as follows:",,as_expected,2020,482,

Their claim is for approximately €2.4 million. No provision was booked in the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018. The Commercial Court handed down a judgment on 23 March 2017 that exonerated Gadest and Autodistribution, and retained the potential liability of three other subsidiaries, adding that the €0.3 million in compensation is secured by Klarius’ English parent companies in collective proceedings. This judgement is not enforceable. In this context, Group confirms its historical position and consider that the probability of an outflow of resources has not been demonstrated, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the lawsuit. An appeal in “cassation” was formulated on October 11, 2018 by the liquidator of Klarius. The Group is therefore awaiting briefs and a date for oral argument.",,as_expected,2020,482,

The financial asset is classified in its entirety and is not subject to complex rules of decomposition. Two criteria are used to determine how financial assets should be classified and measured: - the business model of the entity for the management of financial assets, and - the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial asset. For a financial asset in the scope of IFRS 9, there are 3 types of economic models: - If the objective of the business model is exclusively to hold financial assets to cash out contractual cash flows: the financial asset is measured at amortized cost. - If the objective of the business model is both to hold financial assets to cash out in contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets: the financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The Group’s financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and in the category of financial assets measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are recognized over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortized issue costs are presented as a deduction from the liabilities to which they relate. Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized through the amortized cost mechanism. Fair value IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, as effective for as of 1 July 2014, establishes a fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels: Level 1: prices on the valuation date for identical instruments to those being valued, quoted on an active market to which the entity has access; Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs; Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from extrapolations).This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is obliged to rely on its own assumptions to assess the data that other market participants would have applied to price other instruments. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. At 31 December 2018: At 31 December 2017: The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The financial instruments are contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, which are generated directly by its operations. The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing these risks are summarized below.

The tax rates and tax laws applied to determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the income statement. The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution Economique _Territoriale—CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises—CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods for determining said contribution with regard to_ the provisions adopted by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité—CNC) and it concluded that this contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010. liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year in which the asset is realized or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules) enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred taxes related to items recognized directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in the income statement. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Significant judgements and estimates The calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of tax management strategies. Recognized deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s six-year business plan for the year ended 31 December 2017 and of five-year business plan for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it no longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some or all of said deferred tax assets can be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized if it becomes likely that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Breakdown of deferred tax according to type before set off: According to French Finance Act of 2013, effective as of 31 December 2012, loss carry-forward is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount. Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the tax loss carry-forwards. The result obtained is then included in the Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also applies. A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the six-year business plan for France to determine the future utilization of tax loss carry-forwards in light of existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognized in the financial statements at 31 December 2018. This exercise shows that €231.3 million in tax loss carry-forwards would be utilized, i.e., a tax saving of €64.3 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of the business plan, the deferred tax asset recognized in the financial statements was limited to this amount. At 31 December 2018, tax loss carry-forwards, after utilizing €28.5 million in 2018, stood at €118.8 million for the expanded base and €284.6 million for the Parts Holding Europe tax consolidation group in France. No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse in the long term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2019 budget and the five-year business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax assets after the said period, except as a deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the reporting date.
