623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a global specialty chemicals group focusing on intermediates, composites and specialties sectors, headquartered in Italy. Our business began in the mid 1950s and through a series of acquisitions and organic growth we have grown into one of the leading global composites and coatings technology producers in the world, with unparalleled footprint and reach. Since 2008, we have grown to become a European Leader in Specialty and Composites, by acquiring, PCCR, the composites and resins business of Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc. in 2011, and CCP, the composites business of the Total Group in 2014. The acquisitions of PCCR and CCP significantly increased our presence in the composites sector, particularly in the production of UPRs and gelcoat, and expanded our geographic footprint in North America, South America, Asia and Australia. In 2017, we combined with Reichhold to form a global group in the intermediates, composites and specialties sectors, benefitting from Reichhold’s technical know-how in the field of unsaturated polyester resins and gelcoat. See “Business—History.” We divide our products into three classes: Composites, Specialties and Intermediates. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated €1,618 million, €329 million, and €81 million of our revenue from Composites, Specialties and Intermediates, respectively, representing 79.8%, 16.2%, and 4.0% of our revenue for the same period, respectively. Composites include UPRs, coating resins and compound products (such as gelcoats). Composites, which are produced in batches, are made from two or more constituent materials with different physical or chemical properties which, when combined, produce a material with characteristics different from the individual components to match specific customer requirements. Specialties include plasticizers and other derivative products such as malic and fumaric acid as well as special anhydrides and special esters made using internally produced anhydrides that satisfy specific, highperformance requirements of the end applications in which they are used. Intermediates are produced on a continuous basis (i.e., not in batches) and include the anhydrides which we use internally to produce higher-margin Composites and Specialties. Intermediates not used internally are sold to third parties for use in their own Specialty and Composite production. See “Business—Our Business _Lines.”_ Each class comprises several individual products which, in turn, have multiple applications for various end user, including building and construction (approximately 38% of our revenue in 2020 based on management estimates), transportation (approximately 13% of our revenue in 2020 based on management estimates), house appliances (approximately 11% of our revenue in 2020 based on management estimates), electrical (approximately 10% of our revenue in 2020 based on management estimates), marine (approximately 5% of our revenue in 2020 based on management estimates), wind energy (approximately 5% of our revenue in 2020 based on management estimates), and other, including food & feed (approximately 18% of our revenue in 2020 based on management estimates). In addition, many of our products, particularly our Intermediates, are used internally in the production of other, higher-margin products in different classes. We usually target niche segments of our end applications, which offer higher growth opportunities due to the more favorable penetration opportunities and a greater focus on innovation compared to the broader segments of such end applications. We sell our products to over 5,000 customers worldwide. Over the years, we have built many strong and stable relationships with our customers, many of whom we have been supplying for over 20 years, primarily through our experienced, international internal sales staff who market our products in over 100 countries. We operate 36 production and distribution facilities and 13 R&D laboratories, spanning across Europe, the ----- Americas and Asia. Our operations consist of: (i) research and development; (ii) sourcing and purchase of raw materials; (iii) production, energy sourcing and quality control; and (iv) product sales, technical assistance and distribution. We are committed to the research and development of new and innovative products. R&D is fully integrated into our business model, with our research and development operations being focused on two main areas: (i) product research, and (ii) technology research. See “Business—Our Operations—Research and _Development.”_ For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenue, GVA and Average Unit Margin of €1,745.8 million, €585.0 million and €595 per ton, respectively (€2,043.0 million, €584.5 million and €557 per ton in 2019, respectively), selling 983,966 tons of our products. Our profit for the same period and Adjusted EBITDA were €43.2 million and €261.1 million, respectively (€107.4 million and €241.4 million in 2019). For the year ended December 31, 2020, 44.5% of our total revenue were generated in the Americas, while 44.4% were generated in Europe, with the remaining 11.1% of our total revenue generated in Asia, respectively. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we had total revenue, GVA and Average Unit Margin of €2,028 million,[1] €674.5 million and €/ton 640, respectively, selling 1,053,336 tons of our products with 42.2% of our total revenue generated in the Americas, 47.8% in Europe, with the remaining 10% of our total revenue generated in Asia.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,,"We believe that the following are our key competitive strengths: _Leading position in an industry with an improved structure_ We are a leading manufacturer of Composites in both Europe and the US according to our estimates based on 2019 data. Furthermore, we are a leader by volumes for Compounds in Europe and in the US for Alkyd Coating Resins. The Composites industry has undertaken a significant process of consolidation over the past decade, which has resulted in the creation of a number of global players, e.g., AOC Aliancys, INEOS as well as ourselves. We have expanded our footprint and capabilities and contributed to such consolidation by acquiring PCCR, the composites and resins business of Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc., and CCP, the composites business of the Total Group, in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and, more recently, by combining with Reichhold in 2017, as a result of which our market share in UPRs (representing capacity by producer) increased from 8% and 7% in Europe and America, respectively, in 2011 to 40% and 30%, respectively, based on 2019 data. Traditionally, the Composite industry has pursued a volumes based approach to sales, which often contributed to a mismatch between offer and demand. In recent years, partly as a result of greater focus on value-added products (which carry greater margins), we have experienced a realignment between supply and demand. Competition within the industry remains strong, both on a global scale, among industry leaders, and in specific areas due to the presence of several, well established, regional manufacturers. 1 This based on management accounts and excludes approximately €5.3 million of income realized from March 2021 through the sales of the remaining stock on hand of Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) co. ltd., whose production was discontinued in February 2021 following the mandatory closure request received from the Chinese Government. ----- A key measure of our profitability is GVA/ton. We have increased our GVA/ton profile through a continuous evolution of our portfolio towards higher-margin specialty applications and an improvement in the industry landscape. Our contractual framework both with suppliers and customers allows for price renegotiation on a monthly or quarterly basis or provides for automatic price adjustment based on the average price of the relevant commodity according to various price indices, which allows us to largely pass through volatility in raw materials, limiting the impact of raw material price movements on margins. The table below shows the increase in the GVA/ton profile of the Group from 2018. Source: Management data _Customer focused and innovation driven business model consisting of strong formulation know-how and development initiatives with customers_ Over the past decade, we have evolved from a local producer of Intermediates to a global composite specialty producer. Our strong focus on innovation has driven the transformation of our portfolio, with 79.8% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 being attributable to Composites, from approximately 43% in 2008. The Group is supported by its approximately 100-person technical sales team, which focuses on local customer requirements and specifications, tying in with the Group’s strong focus on direct sales to customers, which represented approximately 90% of the Group’s revenues in the first six months of 2021. Moreover, the Group provides high quality, bespoke formulations and delivers products with identical specifications out of our different facilities to meet the needs of global customers which require consistency across their various locations. Our strong formulation know-how gained over the years has allowed the Group to innovate in application development, delivering over 1,000 SKUs, and we estimate that approximately 15-20% of our product portfolio is renewed each year. The chart below shows the percentage of the Group’s turnover from Composites new products by year of introduction for EMEA: Source: Management data Our business is innovation-driven, with R&D centers strategically located across our worldwide operations. We focus our R&D efforts on anticipating market developments and meeting our customers’ ever evolving needs. Our R&D activities are fully integrated into our business model thereby reducing time to market for new products and enhancements and improving our ability to respond promptly to customer ----- demand, as well as reducing costs and risks relating to new products and increasing environmental safety, all of which have a positive input on margins. We have developed regulatory expertise in highly regulated markets such as the EU and the US, with approximately 350 specialists working in our Research centers, Development labs, Quality Control labs and Technical support teams worldwide. Our R&D centers collaborate closely with our customers to identify, develop and market innovative products that meet our customers’ evolving requirements and competitive challenges. In some instances, we collaborate with clients to go through regulatory approval processes and/or we undergo internal vetting and approval processes. One of the key factors to our success is our ability to provide high quality, bespoke formulations with identical specifications for global customers on a local basis. We have a strong formulation know-how, with a portfolio of over 2,200 formulations, developed over the years, which has allowed us to innovate in application development, delivering over 1,000+ SKUs in 2020. Recent successful innovations include a new formulation for engineering stone to obtain outstanding glossing and scratch resistant kitchen slabs, and new vinyl ester resins for carbon fiber reinforced spar caps for wind blades. The below chart shows a selection of our strategic R&D projects with successful end use applications. We also collaborate with highly specialized universities for specific projects, such as the Universities of Bologna, Munich, the University of Ferrara, and the Politecnico of Milan. In 2020, our research and development expenses were €18.6 million. See “Business—Our Operations—Research and Development.’’ _Diversified customer base_ We have a diversified customer base that includes large multinational companies, with our top 10 customers representing 30.2% of our revenue for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2021, and our largest customer accounting for 8% of our revenue in the same period. Our customer relationships are based on our experience in offering bespoke technological solutions and ongoing local support. In 2020, our top 10 customers by revenue had been customers for more than 20 years on average. Our customer base is diversified across product categories, with our top ten customers by revenue operating across different industries, including distribution, wind energy, paint and coatings, artificial stone and cables and wires. The below table shows out top ten customers by revenue for the period ended June 30, 2021. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Approximately 90% of our sales volumes are conducted directly by our internal sales force. Composites are often borne out of significant collective efforts with customers to develop the optimal product for their end and use applications. The customized solutions we provide vary depending on the characteristics and chemical composition of the end and use applications, logistical needs (for example, ease of transport and shelf-life) and specific regulatory requirements. Providing high-quality products with specificity, sensitivity and consistency, coupled with extensive product validation data are key to fostering customer retention. In addition, the quality and dependability of our products are sometimes critical to obtaining commercialization and marketing approval from regulatory agencies. _Global footprint allowing proximity to our customers base_ Marketing and distribution of UPRs is a complex process due to their limited shelf life (approximately 1 month) and the limited range available for transportation from the relevant production sites (approximately up to 2,000 km). Our manufacturing footprint is strategically located to ensure access to key logistic routes and manufacturing clusters. As a result, our global footprint and proximity to our clients is a key competitive strength as it allows us to service a larger number of clients in different geographies, with lower logistical costs and shorter lead times to provide just-in-time service. With 36 production sites and distribution facilities worldwide, we are typically close to our customers. This proximity to our customers, together with our highly experienced and well trained sales and support staff enables us to efficiently deliver our products to over 5,000 customers across more than 100 countries. Our geographical reach and penetration enables us to respond rapidly and effectively to our customers’ demands, and is a key factor in our ability to develop and maintain customer relationships. _Diverse product portfolio enables us to focus on attractive market niches, benefitting from strong organic growth trends in end industries_ Our diverse portfolio of products enables us to focus on a number of highly attractive and diverse end applications, most of which offer significant structural growth potential. The variety of end uses for our products enables us to mitigate the impact on our business of cyclicality or seasonality that some of these markets from time-to-time experience. As a result of our diverse product portfolio, we are well positioned and equipped to take advantage of new trends in customer demand that may develop, naturally or in response to macro events such as the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced growing demand for our products that are used in professional hygiene, home and personal care and wood protection market end uses both in the US and Europe, as customers have placed greater focus on health protection and well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is a trend we believe will continue as a “new normal”. In addition, we have recorded greater demand for light weight products in the mobility sector as well as a greater demand for Composites, as opposed to traditional metals, in the wind energy market. Some of our products, such as resins and coatings, are subject to seasonal demand as they are used in market segments that have higher demand during spring and summer (e.g., paints for home maintenance and marine coatings). This seasonality helps us manage our volumes over the course of the year to maintain relatively stable production. ----- We divide our diverse product portfolio into three classes: Composites, Specialties and Intermediates. These product classes expose us to a broad range of attractive customer market niches, which have benefitted from positive macroeconomic and societal trends (such as, population growth benefitting the infrastructure and construction industries, and the increased focus on sustainability benefitting the wind energy industry). See “Industry—Key Outlook for our End Applications” The below chart shows the application of our product portfolio in a selection of customers’ end applications. _Integrated platform with stable profitability_ Our production process is based on a vertically-integrated model, which allows us to leverage the in-house production and consumption of Intermediates (e.g. phthalic and maleic anhydrides), which tend to have more volatile prices, in the downstream production of higher-margin Composites and Specialties. In 2020, phthalic and maleic anhydrides, which we produce for captive use, represented 25% of the total raw materials cost of producing UPRs. Therefore, we benefit from low volatility in terms of input cost and supply, and we are capable of delivering to our customers a greater level of availability of our products and certainty in delivery. Further, having access to vertically integrated intermediate and low-cost inputs supports our margins and helps us capture a greater share of profit across the value chain, especially in Europe where we have experienced demand for Intermediates outpacing the offer establishing a trend, which we believe, is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. The vertically integrated nature of our business, together with our proprietary catalyst technology used to produce our higher-margin products gives us significant operational autonomy from the volatile raw material prices, in particular in the Intermediates market. This reduces our dependency on suppliers while providing greater flexibility in timing price adjustments, as it allows us to foresee trends in advance, and an ability to respond quickly to changes in customer demand and test effectiveness of our products in-house. The Group is better able to predict trends in Intermediates pricing, as it purchases their main petrochemical raw materials. This allows the Group to be proactive in its price adjustment decisions compared to non-vertically integrated producers. Our proprietary catalyst technology has been developed through the years, allowing the Group to develop a leading technology for the oxidation catalysts for the production of maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and trimellitic anhydride, which can be used in conjunction with any of the processes currently used worldwide for the production of those molecules. Moreover, we license our technology to third parties, for example for the production of maleic anhydride from butane with fluid bed reactors, where the catalyst is a main part of its production. Our proprietary catalyst technology and know-how is currently used only by two other producers worldwide, which are not our end product competitors. ----- _Strong free cash flow from customer base and maintenance capex-light business model_ We have achieved resilient performance over the years with strong and stable cash flow generation. During the last three years, we have increased our profit for the period and Adjusted EBITDA Margin from €34.8 million and 10.2% in 2018, respectively, and €107.4 million and 11.8% in 2019, respectively, to €43.2 million and 15.0% in 2020, respectively. We have generated significant cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow over the last three years, and in particular €115 million and €162 million, €169 million and €215 million, and €222 million and €255 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Our business model, including our focus on directing our portfolio towards higher growth and higher margin products, has proven its resilience with strong performance in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. During 2020 and the first half of 2021, there has been an increase in market demand for our products coupled with a market-wide decrease in supply, as a result of shortages of raw materials, logistics issues affecting the market, and competitors’factory closures. Combined with increased customer liquidity, these trends resulted in an increase in prices for our products which was greater than the increase in raw material prices. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue and Average Unit Margin were €2,028 million[2] and €640 per ton, compared to €1,746 million and €595 per ton, respectively and €2,043 million and €557 per ton, respectively, for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Further, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 our profit for the period and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were €125.8 million and 16.8%, compared to €43.2 million and 12.7%, respectively, and €107.4 million and 11.8%, respectively, for the period ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our robust margins are attributable to our vertical integration, our leadership position across the value chain, our strong relationships with our customers. Our contractual framework both with suppliers and customers allows for price renegotiation on a monthly or quarterly basis or provides for automatic price adjustment based on the average price of the commodity according to various price indices, which allows us to largely pass through volatility in raw materials, limiting the impact of raw material price movements on margins. We also strive to maintain stability through industry cycles by developing and maintaining relationships with customers that are industry leaders and relatively less vulnerable to economic downturns because of their financial strength and therefore maintain a stable demand for our products. Furthermore, we have a maintenance capital expenditure light operational structure, as our production processes rely on small scale reactors that operate at moderate temperatures and use batch production methods and, as a result, require limited maintenance and repair baseload capital expenditure. We also benefit from the cost advantages of operating large-scale, integrated facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customers locations. The combined result of our strong cash flow generation and asset light model has been that over time we consistently managed to achieve reductions in our net levels of indebtedness. In the period 2018-2020, we have incurred Total Capital Expenditures of €48.8 million, €50.2 million and €50.1 million per year, respectively, to maintain and enhance our facilities’ efficiency, representing 2-3% of our annual revenue in the same period, and we estimate capital expenditure of approximately €50 million per year in the coming years. We believe that this structure allows us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates and helps us maintain positive margins and solid cash flows even during industry downturns or periods of decreased customer demand. _Highly experienced management team, leading talented workforce_ Through acquisitions and organic growth, we have developed from a small regional European producer of Intermediates into a diversified global player in Composites, Intermediates and Specialties, with revenue of €1,745.8 million in 2020. Through this growth, we have established a strong know-how in the sectors in which we operate, particularly in understanding the profile of our customers and the dynamics of our business which has enabled us to sustain this global growth. This growth has been led, and enabled, by a team of highly qualified members of our senior management team that combined have over 45 years of experience in our industry. Our Chief Executive Officer, Rosario Valido joined Alusuisse (at the time a Group company) in 1982 and since then has held various management positions. Paolo Carugati joined the Group in 2006 as Chief Financial Officer, and had previously held other finance roles, including being CFO of another multinational group from 2000. Sergio Mario Conni joined the Group in 2009 following the acquisition of Chemial Group. Since then, Sergio has covered various operations and business management positions in the Group. From 2014 to 2017 Sergio covered the position of Senior 2 This based on management accounts and excludes approximately €5.3 million of income realized from March 2021 through the sales of the remaining stock on hand of Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) co. ltd., whose production was discontinued in February 2021 following the mandatory closure request received from the Chinese Government. ----- Vice President Americas, reporting to the CEO. He then moved back to Italy and served as EVP Europe, until taking over as Group COO in July 2020. Our senior management team is supported by a lean and efficient organizational structure that relies on talent, expertise and passion to help us create value. We invest in the training and wellbeing of our work-force as a means to improve performance and foster retention, which in turn are key factors in our efforts to further our growth and future development. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we invested €613.4 thousand on welfare projects in Italy. We also benefit from the expertise and experience of Black Diamond Capital Management LLC (“Black",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

In addition to its interest in the Polynt Group, Black Diamond currently controls TFL Ledertechnik GmbH (“TFL”), a Europe-focused, global specialty chemicals player with a focus on specialty chemicals for the leather industry, and, together with Investindustrial, Bakelite Synthetics, a European and US specialty chemicals player carved out from Hexion’s phenolic specialty business. Black Diamond’s prior control investments in the Chemicals industry include Arclin, a specialty resins producer and Vertellus, a diversified specialty chemicals producer serving the agriculture, nutrition and various other markets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.1,,"Our principal objectives are to continue operating as a global supplier of Composites, Intermediates, and Specialties and to increase the value of the business by generating strong, sustainable and growing cash flows across industry cycles. To achieve these objectives we focus on five main pillars: _Leverage positive underlying industry dynamics_ Our markets are growing, with strong pull-through demand from our customer base and attractive end industries dynamics. We plan to continue to focus on such highly attractive end applications that offer significant and enduring growth potential with an aim to expand our operations. In Composites, we intend to take full advantage of recent trends in some of our key end-markets. These include increasing demand for light-weight UPRs in the transportation segment as well as increasing demand for the Composites used for wind turbines due to growing demand for wind turbines driven by the continuing shift to renewables. At the same time, we plan to exploit increasing demand for coating resins in the building market driven by the growing outdoor application sector, and increase our presence in the water-borne coatings segment as many emerging economies continue to switch from solvent-borne to water-borne coatings. In Specialties, we intend to further exploit the significant grow of plasticizers demand we recently recorded due to the increased use of plasticizers in the automotive markets, as well as the increased demand from non-cyclical applications such as wiring, cable and medical devices. We are focusing on developing sustainable solutions via special purposes plasticizers that are phthalate-free. Furthermore, we plan to continue benefitting from the increased use of malic acid and other specialties in multiple food and cosmetics applications. Our Specialties are widely used in high end applications and sectors, like cosmetics, food and feed, pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrancies, health care, and other luxury items. Most of these sectors are not cyclical and management expects to leverage on the Group’s breadth of experience and wide product portfolio to capture market growth. In Intermediates we intend to continue to benefit from our vertical integration to use our Intermediates and use our access to Intermediates production to manufacture higher margin products. _Pursue initiatives to grow and create value_ We pursue high-return organic initiatives to grow and create value with selected projects. We seek growth through improvements of our product portfolio, in particular with respect to Specialties, and value-added downstream products, as well as by targeting new geographies. In Asia for example, we aim to increase UPR margins by expanding the production of UPRs and Gelcoat in China. In Eastern-Europe, we believe we can capture demand growth through capacity expansion of UPRs and Gelcoat in Poland. Through our plant in Spain, we hope to target the electrical and automotive markets in Europe. In the U.S., we intend to expand the range of products in our facilities to include Specialty Anhydrides, Specialty Plasticizers and Compounds to support growth of our global clients operating in the Americas and to strengthen our footprint in high value-add products. ----- We are also aiming to improve our production flexibility across Europe, United Kingdom, and North Africa and to upgrade vinyl ester production technologies to serve clients in the growing wind energy markets. We are also pursuing other efficiency initiatives to target, among others, Intermediates with a view to improving operational efficiency, by seeking to achieve better selectivity and energy efficiency by carefully modifying the catalyst chemistry. For example, our new fluidized bed catalyst generation is intended to increase yield with a reduction in CO2 production per ton of maleic anhydride, as well as new phthalic anhydride reactor with additional capacity and reduced CO2 production. We will also continue to consider potential bolt-on acquisitions with focus on carefully selected assets. _Continue innovation to deliver successful new applications_ Our R&D operations are key to maintaining our innovation and ability to respond to market developments and customer needs, and are a core component of our customer offering. Our innovation projects are driven by market demand and customer needs for applications that meet evolving customer needs. This innovation is a key driver of revenue growth. We focus on continually improving our product offering through the introduction of tailor-made solutions and development of new applications to drive higher margins. Co-development initiatives are the predominant channel for developing new products that are demanded by customers for their new products, creating strong customer relationships and customer loyalty. Our main R&D objectives are to: (i) develop new formulations and cutting-edge technologies, such as environmentally friendly vapor-free coatings, (ii) lower the environmental impact of our production, (iii) improve process efficiency and productivity of MA, PA, and TMA, via proprietary catalyst technology, and by decreasing cost of production, and (iv) introduce new and better performing products aligned with segment needs. We intend to use, protect and further develop our intellectual property and unpatented proprietary knowhow by identifying the best practices and the most efficient technologies. We believe that technology innovation can help us achieve a sustainable cost position. We seek to optimize the overall effectiveness of our asset base by making appropriate investments in maintenance, turnaround times and capital equipment in conjunction with personnel training and site and plant benchmarking. _Grow an environmental and sustainability platform by focusing on sustainable products and manufacturing with a positive ESG market_ Our strategies and objectives are underpinned by a commitment to sustainability and ESG (environment, social and governance) values. We aim to operate and develop our business in a way that takes into account relevant economic, as well as environmental and social and governance factors. We also believe sustainability is a lever for growth and will enable us to tap into new and emerging business opportunities. To support this, we have recently appointed an ESG manager, who is responsible for internal auditing of ESG compliance. The below chart shows select ESG metrics for the year ended December 31, 2019. ----- For example, in order to reduce the environmental impact of Composites, we continue to identify new processes aimed at the recovery of chemicals in end-of-life Composites with the objective to re-use materials in polymer synthesis and to reduce the end-of-life environmental impact of Composites, and to improve their carbon footprint by favoring their use for multiple applications. We have a wide product portfolio and technology for recycled composites, such as recycling in cement production operations (full industrial examples available) and chemical recycling (under pilot scale development). For example, R-PET from bottles and other products is used to produce a type of UPR that is then used in piping and composite concrete material for buildings and infrastructures; and recycled carbon fiber from high-end automotive material is reused in producing SMC for transportation industry in structural applications. Moreover, on the R&D side, we are working with other industry partners and stakeholders on technology for chemical recycling of UPR, where the material is broken down into its original chemical components and re-reacted to produce new UPR molecules. In terms of CO2 emission, we continue to pursue a reduction in emissions and energy use optimization, in particular by focusing on the development of higher performing catalysts for maleic anhydride and phthalic anhydride production. We monitor our CO2 emissions globally and have implemented reduction plans in our production facilities with the higher emissions. Moreover, we purchase voluntary CO2 credits, to offset our CO2 emissions that are outside the scope of the EU ETS regulations. Furthermore, we continue to seek to reduce heat loss, increase electrical motor efficiency, improve lighting systems, and optimize natural gas burner systems. For example, some of our recently implemented projects are: (i) the creation of combined power and heat in Scanzorosciate (Italy), and (ii) the optimization of catalyst performance for selective oxidation processes to reduce CO2. Since 2017, we have reduced our CO2 emissions intensity (being emissions volume in proportion to our revenue) by 7.0% p.a. from 332 tons/€million in 2017 to 267 tons/€million in 2020. Although, our emissions intensity increased in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 due to a reduction in our revenue base in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, we continue to pursue a reduction in emissions. Based on an approximate internal calculation carried out by management on an interim basis, we estimate that our CO2 emissions for 2021 will be approximately 233 ton/€million. The following table shows our CO2 emissions intensity for the periods indicated. ----- Our portfolio includes various products with increasing use in renewables, such as UPRs, bonding paste, vinyl ester resins, and gelcoats for wind blades and nacelles. Recent trends for wind blades include the use of larger blades, higher throughput, and improved environmental controls. We are developing a new styrene-free Gelcoat to eliminate emissions of styrene. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize waste generation in our facilities, for example by reusing used/spent solvents both internally and externally. _Deleveraging_ On the Acquisition Closing Date and as a result of the Transactions, our Adjusted net transaction leverage ratio will be 3.8x. One of our primary goals is to continue to generate cash flow to facilitate deleveraging. Our management is strongly focused on deleveraging the Group’s balance sheet. See “Forward_Looking Statements.” To achieve this goal, we will place significant management emphasis on cash generation and efficient capital spending. Historically, we have been able to generate strong cash flow while meeting the capital requirement of our business, and we believe we are well positioned to generate strong free cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Recent Developments,9.6.1,,"_Current Trading_ Our recent performance for the two months ending August 31, 2021, in terms of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Unit Margins, has continued in line with the beginning of the year, as the Group continues to benefit from strong demand for its products leading to continued profitability and cash generation. Based on our unaudited preliminary management accounts for last twelve months ended August 31, 2021, we generated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €376.8 million, particularly driven by higher volumes and higher Average Unit Margins. Further, based on our unaudited preliminary management accounts for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, our revenues, GVA, Average Unit Margin and Volume were approximately €2,143.6 million, €716.2 million, 685 €/ton and 1,046 ton, respectively. As of August 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately €415.4 million. The total implied enterprise value for the Acquisition was approximately €2.5 billion, representing an 8.9x multiple over the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, which was equal to approximately €280 million. _The preliminary financial results presented above are derived from our unaudited internal monthly management accounts and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our operations or financial results for any period or the quarter ended September 30, 2021.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,The Transactions,9.7.1,The Acquisition,"On June 29, 2021, Speciality Chemicals International II Limited (“SCIL II”) entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “SPA”) to acquire the entire issued share capital of the Target from Speciality Chemicals International Limited (“SCIL”). Before the Acquisition Closing Date, it is expected that SCIL II will transfer its rights and obligations under the SPA to the Parent pursuant to a novation agreement to be entered into among SCIL, the Parent and SCIL II. Completion of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including antitrust and foreign investment approvals (which have all been obtained), as well as the performance of certain closing actions. We currently expect completion of the Acquisition to take place in the fourth quarter of 2021. If completion does not take place by January 31, 2022 (or if extended, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by the Parent, March 31, 2022), the SPA may be terminated by either party. See “Use of Proceeds” for the estimated sources and uses required for the Acquisition. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions”._ The Target is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SCIL, which is, directly or indirectly, owned by Global Chemicals S. à r.l. (“GCS”), Global Chemicals BD Holdings III, LLC or its successor in title (“BD III”), Global Chemicals BD Holdings IV, LLC or its successor in title (“BD IV”) and Reichhold Cayman, LP or its successor in title (“Reichhold Cayman”). GCS is indirectly controlled by funds affiliated with Investindustrial, and BD III, BD IV and Reichhold Cayman are indirectly controlled by Black Diamond. The Parent is a subsidiary of SCIL III LLC (“HoldCo”) and is indirectly controlled by Black Diamond The US Co-Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent. Both the Parent and the US Co-Issuer were incorporated to facilitate the Acquisition. The consideration payable by the Parent to SCIL under the SPA is €2,209,940,717 (assuming the Acquisition Closing Date would have occurred on June 30, 2021). The actual consideration payable at the Acquisition Closing Date may vary, depending on the timing of the Acquisition Closing Date as a result of a ticking fee and possible deductions due to any known leakages. A portion equal to 45.59% of the consideration will be paid in cash, with the remainder being paid through the issuance of a convertible loan note. It is expected that on the Acquisition Closing Date, the obligations under the convertible loan note will be transferred to the Parent’s indirect shareholder, SCIL II (Topco) Limited (“SCIL II Holdco”) and that SCIL will convert the loan note into such number of shares in SCIL II Holdco as would give SCIL ownership of not less than 99% of the shares in SCIL II Holdco and BD III and BD IV will contribute their shares in SCIL II Holdco to SCIL, thereby giving SCIL ownership of 100% of the shares in SCIL II Holdco. In addition, on the Acquisition Closing Date, we expect that GCS will reduce its capital by cancelling all of the shares in SCIL held by GCS and distribute the cash proceeds received under the SPA to GCS by way of a special dividend expressly provided for in SCIL’s articles of association, as a result of which GCS will exit its shareholding in SCIL. As a result, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Parent will: (i) become the direct owner of the entire issued share capital of the Target, and (ii) become a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of SCIL and, therefore, the Group will be under the indirect control of Black Diamond.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The purchase price payable may differ from the amount presented, depending on the actual timing of the Acquisition Closing Date and the certain adjustments provided for under the SPA, as described in “The Transactions—The Acquisition”. The remainder of the purchase price for the Acquisition will be satisfied through the issuance of a convertible loan note. It is expected that on the Acquisition Closing Date, the obligations under the convertible loan note will be transferred to the Parent’s indirect shareholder, SCIL II Holdco and that SCIL will convert the loan note into such number of shares in SCIL II Holdco as would give SCIL ownership of not less than 99% of the shares in SCIL II Holdco. BD III and and BD IV will contribute their shares in SCIL II Holdco to SCIL, thereby giving SCIL ownership of 100%. See “The Transactions—The Acquisition”. (6) Represents the amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities including accrued and unpaid interest assuming that the Acquisition Closing Date takes place on November 2, 2021 (being approximately €51 million under the USD TLB, €492 million under the Euro TLB, and €20 million under the RCF), to be repaid in full by using the proceeds from the Parent Proceeds Loan, to be made by the Parent to Specialty Chemicals Holding I B.V. on or about the Acquisition Closing Date by using the proceeds from (x) virtual tranche A2 under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes (which in aggregate will amount to € ), as further described under “—The Transactions-The Financing” above (“Tranche A2”); (y) virtual tranche B2 under the Floating Rate Notes (which in aggregate will amount to the equivalent of € ), as further described under “—The Transactions-The Financing” above (“Tranche B2”); and (z) virtual tranche C2 under the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes (which in aggregate will amount to the equivalent of € ), as further described under “—The Transactions—The Financing”above (“Tranche C2”). The amounts outstanding under the dollar term loan has been converted at a rate of $1.1884 per euro. Upon repayment, the Existing Senior Facilities will be cancelled. (7) Represents our estimate of fees and expenses in connection with or otherwise related to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, including underwriting fees and commissions, other financing fees, debt prepayment premiums, professional and legal fees, financial advisory fees, and other transaction costs including certain costs relating to the Acquisition, to be financed with cash on the balance sheet of the Group together with all the proceeds from (i) virtual tranche D under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes (which in aggregate will amount to the equivalent of € ), as further described under “—The Transactions—The _Financing” above (“Tranche D”); (ii) virtual tranche E under the Floating Rate Notes (which in aggregate will amount to the_ equivalent of € ), as further described under “—The Transactions-The Financing” above (“Tranche E”); and (iii) virtual tranche F under the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes (which in aggregate will amount to the equivalent of € ), as further described under “—The Transactions—The Financing” above (“Tranche F”). Actual fees and expenses may differ. (8) Represents certain Local Facilities which we expect will be repaid on the Acquisition Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of each of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Floating Rate Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes is aimed at identifying the separate portions of the proceeds of the Offering being used to consummate the Acquisition and grant the Parent Proceeds Loan for purposes of the Refinancing and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (CUSIPs, ISINs or common codes) for each such tranche under the Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Germany GmbH Reichhold AS Polynt Composites Norway AS (1) On the Acquisition Closing Date, Black Diamond will indirectly control all of the share capital of the Parent, which will acquire the Target. It is expected that on the Acquisition Closing Date, the obligations under the convertible loan note issued by the Parent to SCIL will be transferred to the Parent’s indirect shareholder, SCIL II Holdco and that SCIL will convert the loan note into such number of shares in SCIL II Holdco as would give SCIL ownership of not less than 99% of the shares in SCIL II Holdco and BD III and BD IV will contribute their shares in SCIL II Holdco to SCIL, thereby giving SCIL ownership of 100% of the shares in SCIL II Holdco. In addition, on or shortly after the Acquisition Closing Date, we expect that GCS will exit its shareholding in SCIL. As a result, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Parent will: (i) become the direct owner of the entire issued share capital of the Target, and (ii) become a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of SCIL and, therefore, the Group will be under the control of Black Diamond. See “Principal Shareholders.” The shareholding percentages presented in the chart above represent the expected shareholding percentages in the Issuers and may be subject to variations. (2) On the Acquisition Closing Date, Black Diamond will provide the Parent with an aggregate amount of at least €85 million by way of equity contribution. The actual amount of the Equity Contribution may vary depending on the amount actually required to fund the completion of the Transaction, when taken together with the proceeds of the Offering, up to a maximum amount of €150 million. Following the Transactions, Black Diamond will indirectly hold the entire issued share capital of the Parent other than a stake of approximately 13% to 16%, depending on the exercise of certain pre-emption rights in connection with the Equity Contribution, that is expected to be held by minority investors. (3) Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes into the Escrow Accounts. The Escrow Accounts will be pledged in favor of, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. See “Summary—The Offering—Collateral”. The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within one business day of the Acquisition Closing Date) to pay such consideration. See “Description _of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”._ (4) The Parent, HoldCo and SCIL II Holdco were incorporated as holding companies for the purpose of the Acquisition and US Co-Issuer is expected to become a holding company as a result of the Post-Transaction Reorganization, have no independent ----- business operations, other than those in connection with their incorporation and the Transactions, and have no significant assets, other than the equity interest each of these companies holds in its subsidiaries . The US Co-Issuer is a special purpose vehicle which will have no assets and no subsdiaries until the successful completion of the Post-Transaction Reorganization. The only other asset of the Issuers, as of the Issue Date, will be the Escrowed Property pending consummation of the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the restrictive covenants in the Indenture will only apply to the Issuers and the Issuers and their subsidiaries will not obtain control of the Target Group until the Acquisition Closing Date. (5) Prior to the Issue Date, the Parent and US Co-Issuer, among others, are expected to enter into a super senior revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of €85 million. The SSRCF will be secured by first-ranking security granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the Collateral. In the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral (on a pro rata basis) only after the lenders under the SSRCF and certain future hedging obligations have been repaid in full pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. (6) On the Acquisition Closing Date, the net proceeds from the Offering of the Notes will be used, together with the proceeds from the Equity Contribution, and existing cash on balance sheet of the Target Group, to (i) fund (directly or indirectly) the Acquisition, (ii) repay on the Acquisition Closing Date, amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities; and (iii) pay fees and expenses relating to the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds”. (7) The Issuers are offering €1,300.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will be general, senior obligations of the Issuers and will (i) be secured by liens over the Collateral equally, on a contractual first priority basis with the obligations under the SSRCF, certain other indebtedness that may be incurred in the future, certain hedging obligations, but pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders of Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of security over the Collateral only after any obligations that are entitled to receive such proceeds on a super priority basis, including obligations under the SSRCF, certain other indebtedness that may be incurred in the future and certain hedging obligations, have been paid in full; (ii) rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including under the SSRCF; (iii) rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; (iv) be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness or other liabilities of the Issuers that are secured by liens on assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness or liabilities; and (v) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors. The Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis, within 120 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the SSRCF, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain significant limitations under local law and customary guarantee limitations, by the Guarantors. On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed and will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations under local law, on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Issue Date Collateral.

Within 120 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations under local law and substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the SSRCF, the Notes and Guarantees thereof (as defined herein) will be secured by the Post-Closing Date Collateral. The Collateral will also secure the SSRCF on a first-priority basis. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security and the liability of each Guarantor (as defined herein) and security provider will be subject to certain limitations. The security interests in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Guarantees” and _“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._ (8) For the period ended June 30, 2021, on an aggregate basis, the Guarantors generated 61.7%, of our profit for the period, 75.6% of our revenue (excluding intercompany transactions) and 78.6% of our Adjusted EBITDA.

Considering the final Supreme Court decision and that Reichhold do Brazil filed a legal claim prior to March 15, 2017, covering the periods from October 2003 through April 2017, the Group has accounted for an “income” for these available tax credits in the six months period ended June 30, 2021. As this income is non-recurring in nature, management included this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2021. (iii) Costs related to cash-settled share-based plans represents the accrual of the award to certain directors and employees of one-off payments under the Phantom Share Option Plan (“PSP”) and extraordinary deal bonus plan (“EB Plan”). The PSP has a timeframe up to 2026, while the EB Plan has a timeframe up to the end 2021 and contemplated a one-off compensation to certain directors and employees linked to specific, pre-agreed events such as the Acquisition. Every fiscal year a liability was recorded as a charge to the statement of profit and loss based on the estimated payout and trigger date. As a change of control will likely become effective prior to the original two plans duration, a significant accrual has been accounted for in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The accrued awards to certain directors and employees under the PSP will be settled by cash as part of the Management Bonuses in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds”and “Transactions—Sources _and Uses”. As the Cash-settled share-based plan accrual is non-core and not directly corresponding to the business of each_ period, management included this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. (iv) Restructuring expense are costs related to site closures in Dubai, Canada, US, Brazil, Norway, Australia, Hong Kong, and to the closure imposed by the Government in China (Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) co. ltd). and other restructuring costs. Management included this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA in order to reflect the core performance of the Group. (v) Merger and acquisition (“M&A”) expenses includes external M&A advisors and financial, commercial and legal due diligence fees and expenses, in respect to completed and potential acquisitions. As these are one-off costs that were incurred in connection with extraordinary transactions, management included this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. ----- (vi) Claim settlement costs in 2019 related to the definitive settlement agreement of a claim between (a) certain subsidiaries of the former Reichhold Group and (b) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) with an effective date November 1, 2019. The foregoing agreement settles the claim asserted by the PBGC in March 2015 against the non-US Reichhold subsidiaries. The PBGC had assumed the pension obligations of Reichhold Inc as part of the Reichhold, Inc bankruptcy process. Claim settlement costs in 2020 related to the definitive settlement agreement between (a) certain subsidiaries of the former Reichhold Group, (b) the Insurance Companies of the Group and (c) Fountaine Pajot (“FP”) signed on February 12, 2020. As both claims were related to the former Reichhold Group, management do not consider these costs as part of the core business of the Group and included this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. (vii) Insurance compensation received in 2019 is a consequence of an accident occurred at Polynt S.p.A. Maleic Anhydride Ravenna Plant (Italy) causing damage to the catalyst reactor. The occurrence was covered by the insurance policy, including the loss of margins due to lower performance of the plant subsequent to the accident as the Group scheduled to replace both the reactor and the catalyst in the following years. Therefore, the compensation was partially deferred. As this is a one-off event that incurred in connection with an extraordinary event, management included this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA. (viii) The inventory provision income is a non-IFRS management adjustment to adjust for margins accounted for in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and relates to specific and exceptional conditions of the market prices of some raw materials. During the six months period ended June, 30 2021, the prices of several raw materials increased significantly. Since selling prices are based on the current price of raw materials and cost of goods sold is impacted by raw material prices of previous period, which were significantly below current prices, exceptional margins were made during the aforementioned period. The adjustment has been calculated based on a percentage of the average increase in variable costs in the first six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the previous years and budget. As these margins are considered by management a one-off event related to extraordinary market conditions of raw materials, management included this adjustment for the purposes of preparing Adjusted EBITDA in order to reflect continuing profitability of the business. (2) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. (3) Operating working capital represents the amount of trade receivables plus inventories, less trade payables.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,Adverse and uncertain global economic conditions could negatively impact our business and ability to borrow or raise capital.,"Our business is substantially dependent on overall global economic conditions and historical demand has been strongly correlated with global GDP trends. Declining economic conditions—or negative perceptions about global or local economic conditions—could result in a significant decrease in demand in our end applications and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We estimate that the majority of our revenue is generated by sales of our products that are ultimately used in the electrical, construction and transportation sectors. These industries are all cyclical in nature and have historically been adversely affected by downturns in the global economy. The supply-demand balance in the markets where we compete and prices for raw materials are strongly influenced by the overall economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, China and India. In 2020, a sharp decline in economic activity in China in January and February was followed by similar downturns in the rest of the world from March onward. Global GDP declined by 3.5% in 2020. Eurozone GDP contracted by 7.2% (compared to a 1.3% increase in 2019). Some countries were especially hit: GDP fell by 9.0% in France, 9.2% in Italy, 11.1% in Spain and 10.0% in the United Kingdom. In 2020, U.S. GDP fell by 3.4% (compared to a 2.2% increase experienced in 2019). China was the only major global economy to report growth in 2020, with a 2.3% GDP increase (against a 6.0% increase experienced in 2019). In India, by contrast, GDP fell by 8.0% after a lockdown lasting several months (compared to a 4.2% increase in 2019). Although global economic activity is currently growing again, it is not forecasted to return to pre-pandemic levels in the near term. The pace and extent of the global economic recovery remains uncertain, and certain markets, including emerging markets, may not in the future achieve the growth rates that they have historically recorded. An extended recession or other periods of declining economic conditions, either globally or locally in any of the markets in which we operate, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. In addition, a rise in inflation rates in the markets where we operate could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. In 2020, we generated the largest proportion of our profit, revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by country in the U.S. and as a result we are vulnerable to deteriorations in the economic conditions of the U.S., which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we generated 36.7%, 33.9% and 32.4%, respectively, of our total revenues, 94.9%, 30.0% and 33.3%, respectively, of our profit for the period,, and 39.6%. 35.6% and 31.7%, respectively, of our Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S.. In addition, in 2020 we generated the second largest proportion of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by country in Italy and our results are particularly vulnerable to changes in economic and political conditions in Italy. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we generated 25.4%, 26.4% and 27.4%, respectively, of our total revenues, (13.2)%, 17.4% and 52.2%, respectively, of our profit for the period, and 27.0%. 28.7% and 39.5%, respectively, of our Adjusted EBITDA in Italy. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Italy could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Similarly, a significant adverse change in a customer’s financial position, as a result of adverse economic conditions, Covid-19 or otherwise, could increase our credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top ten customers accounted for 27.5% of our sales volume, while our largest customer accounted for 6.4% of our sales volume. Continued weakness in the global economy for a significant period of time, or a further deterioration of global economic conditions, could result in our customers experiencing less profitability in their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty in obtaining financing, which may ultimately lead to liquidations or bankruptcies. In this respect, on September 29, 2021, the shareholders’ meeting of Polynt S.p.A. resolved to put into liquidation the following Chinese subsidiaries: (i) Polynt Hong Kong Co. Ltd., a company set up in 2007 with the aim of developing the business activities of the Polynt group in China, following the cessation of such activities; and (ii) Polynt Chemical (Changzou) Co. Ltd., following the stipulation on November 30, 2020 of a closure and relocation agreement with the local Chinese government authority having as its objective the cessation and relocation of all the production activities, in order to promote the high quality development of the Yangtze River economic belt. Any of these occurrences could cause us to limit or discontinue business with those customers. Our suppliers may also experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfil their obligations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, a number of our customers and suppliers rely on access to credit and/or financing to fund their operations, either of which may be limited due to adverse economic conditions. The inability of our customers to access credit facilities may adversely affect our business by reducing sales and increasing exposure to bad debt, thereby reducing our profitability. In addition, the inability of our suppliers to access credit facilities may adversely affect our business by causing shortages that in turn may result in higher prices for raw material and transportation, which could have an adverse effect on our margins. Our products are used in various end applications, including building and construction, transportation, automotive, electrical, food and feed, marine and home appliances. Markets for our products that have performed well in recent periods despite the struggling global economy may not continue their strong performance, and demand for our products may suffer as a result. Wind energy, transportation and infrastructure are three of key industries that have performed well even during the global economic crisis, particularly with respect to wind energy as people and corporations place an emphasis on clean, affordable and renewable energy. The infrastructure sector managed to remain relatively strong due to increased spending on projects by governments to help jump start economic recovery. Despite the strong performance of these two sectors during a time when the economy at large was struggling, we cannot guarantee that demand for wind energy products or that spending on infrastructure products will not decrease. Consumption in the infrastructure and construction sectors could decrease following the tapering off of the economic support measures enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, spending on wind energy may decline as other sources of both traditional and clean energy become less expensive. In addition, support for government spending on infrastructure may diminish for a variety of reasons including budgetary constraints and the onset of inflationary economic conditions. A decrease in demand for wind energy or decreased government spending on infrastructure projects (or both) could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Political factors also impact the demand for our products and given the various geographical regions we serve, these could further impact our operating results. Demand in Europe and North America has also been driven by customers switching to high-quality products and technological advances in manufacturing that resulted in the replacement of traditional building materials with flexible and recyclable composites and other synthetic materials. Demand in regions such as China and South America has been driven by increased population growth, a growing middle class, focus on industrialization investments and higher infrastructure spending. Our results reflect these trends where we have seen an increase in demand for specialty chemical products being used in building and construction projects in these regions. Accordingly, trends in the industries and geographies where we operate, which are adverse to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"The raw materials we use in our production operations are derived from crude oil and other petroleum feedstocks, which are subject to supply shortages and price volatility.","Raw material costs comprise the largest portion of our operating costs. The majority of the raw materials we use are based on crude oil, including butane, orthoxylene, benzene, styrene and pseudocumene. The availability of these raw materials is essential to our operations. As a general matter, if a supplier is unable to ----- meet its obligations under delivery agreements with us, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere or, in certain limited cases, we may not be able to obtain the raw materials at all. The prices we pay for our raw materials are closely linked to the price of crude oil and crude oil price fluctuations have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and our financial condition. Other raw material costs such as the cost of soybean oil and normal butane used in the production of certain coating crude oil prices. Supply of petroleum feedstocks is often affected by factors over which we have limited control such as market conditions, general global economic prospects, production capacity in the markets, production constraints on the part of our suppliers, fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices, infrastructure failures, political conditions, weather conditions, regulations and other factors. Any reduction in supply of our raw materials would significantly impair our ability to conduct our operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the producers of such petroleum derivatives generally link the price of the products they sell to the international market price of crude oil and other petroleum feedstocks, which are subject to frequent volatility as a result of factors over which we have limited control. Our supply agreements typically provide for market-based pricing. As a result, (i) fluctuations in the global market price of crude oil and other feedstocks tend to have a direct and immediate effect on the prices we pay for such products, (ii) our operating income, operating margin and cash flows from operations are vulnerable to adverse fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro and (iii) our raw material costs may vary significantly from period to period, even when the volume of our production remains relatively constant. In early March 2020, the global oil markets were negatively impacted by an oil supply conflict occurring when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil producing nations (“OPEC +”) were initially unable to reach an agreement on production levels for crude oil, at which point Saudi Arabia and Russia initiated efforts to aggressively increase production. The convergence of these events with the Covid-19 pandemic created the unprecedented dual impact of a dramatic decline in the demand for oil as a result of the significant slowdown in the global economy coupled with the risk of a substantial increase in supply. The result has been a steep decline in oil prices, which has negatively impacted our results due to the reduction of the value of the inventory. In addition, in early September 2021, the global oil markets were negatively impacted by a general crisis of the energy sector as a result of market dynamics wherein crude oil is in short supply, which may affect the supply and prices of crude oil through the first quarter of year 2022 or through any future period. Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, could have a negative impact on our business. If our costs become impacted by significant inflationary pressures or interest rate increases, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Most of our contracts with suppliers and customers allow for price renegotiation on a monthly or quarterly basis or for automatic price adjustment based on the average price of the commodity according to different price indices, which is intended to enable us to pass raw materials cost increases to our customers by raising the price of our products. However, there is no guarantee that this flexibility will be sufficient to adapt our contracts to current business conditions in a way that is suitable to us, or at all. We are not always able to pass through raw material price increases, or in some instances we suffer a certain time lag and, therefore, experience lower margins. Our inability to quickly pass through all raw material cost increases is affected by several additional factors. For example, demand in the end applications where our customers compete can sometimes be too weak to absorb the full effect of price increases. As a result, we sometimes postpone passing on cost increases in an attempt to maintain sales volumes, which can adversely affect our margins. Moreover, if prices of our raw materials, such as crude oil, are declining, customers may delay their purchases of our products until the price drop is reflected in the product’s price. An inability to raise our prices sufficiently or in a timely manner could have, and has in the past had, a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in raw material prices also have a direct effect on our working capital levels. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials leads to an increase in our working capital requirements, as our inventories and trade receivables increase as a result of higher raw materials prices, which increase is only partially offset by an increase in trade payables. Due to the quantity and turnover of the raw materials that we typically keep in stock, this increase occurs gradually over a period of three months. Conversely, decreases in the cost of raw materials lead to a decrease in our working capital requirements within the same three-month period following the decrease in costs. ----- Adverse global economic conditions, market instability, including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and volatile commodity price fluctuations make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand and sales prices, which could cause us to procure raw materials in excess of what is needed to meet end-product demand. This could cause a material increase in our inventory carrying costs and, in the event of falling market prices for our end products, result in significant charges to write-down inventory to market prices. In a declining price environment, demand can decline as customers postpone orders in anticipation of further price decreases. In response to changes in demand levels, our competitors may price their products more aggressively in order to retain market share, which can result in an adverse market environment for us in the short term until the market reaches a new equilibrium. There may be other unforeseen effects, which we cannot predict given the volatility of raw material prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"The occurrence of operational interruptions or problems at our facilities or to our transport infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.","Our business is dependent on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our production facilities. We have 36 production and distribution facilities in Italy, Germany, France, Poland, Spain, Norway, the United Kingdom, China, South Korea, Malaysia, India, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States, and each is subject to operating risks including: - severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, floods, extreme temperature fluctuations or any other natural or man-made disaster; - explosions and other accidents, including pipeline leaks and ruptures; - human error or mechanical failures; - unplanned production downtime; - transportation interruptions; - the impact of pandemics, including the Covid-19 pandemic; - negligent actions of third parties; - terrorism or sabotage aimed at disrupting our production facilities; - unpermitted discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; - political and economic conditions, which drive rapid changes in prices for our key raw materials; and - other environmental health, safety and security risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil and criminal liabilities, including penalties, fines and damage awards. See “—We may incur litigation_related expenses and/or reputational damage, among other losses”. In addition, the global nature of our business necessarily causes us to be susceptible to disruptions of logistics flows for the delivery of raw materials caused by unforeseen events beyond our control, such as poor handling provided by logistics service providers, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, riots and labor strikes. If there is any delay in delivery, damage to products or any related or similar event, our operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, the closure of the Durban, South Africa harbor in July 2021 as a result of civil unrest and the partial closures and reduced operations in certain ports in Guangdong, China, in June 2021 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic caused delays in the delivery of raw materials to our production facilities with a consequential effect on our production logistics. We also have scheduled downtime at our plants in order to perform necessary inspections and testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry out any maintenance that may be necessary. Scheduled maintenance may require longer downtime than anticipated. Extended downtime at any of our major operating facilities, whether the result of scheduled maintenance or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Any significant interruption occurring from time to time in operations at our facilities, including interruptions caused by the events described above, may exceed the limitations of our current insurance coverage, and may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular production plant, or our business as a whole, during and following such interruptions. For example, certain electric power outages ----- in Texas, U.S. resulted in the closure of our production facilities in the state for over a week in February 2021, while in 2019 the damage in the catalyst reaction in one of the maleic anhydride reactors in our Ravenna, Italy plant caused a reduced in the production of the plant and required the replacement of the reactor and the catalyst used therein. Activities for the replacement of the reactor are ongoing and we expect it to be operational by 2022. If any of the foregoing events were to occur, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

For example, there is only one European supplier of the raw material we use to produce trimellitic anhydride, and only one Italian supplier of the raw material we use to produce maleic anhydride. We are, therefore, vulnerable to: (i) the unavailability of such raw materials or the delays in the delivery of such raw materials to our plants; (ii) substantial increases in the price of such raw materials and the limited bargaining power that necessarily comes with negotiating with such suppliers; (iii) decisions by our current suppliers to discontinue the supply of any such raw materials; (iv) financial or operational difficulties affecting our key suppliers; (v) macro and micro economic impacts (such as industry expansions, plant shutdowns, scheduled maintenance, force majeure actions etc.); or (vi) the impact of pandemics such as the Covid-19 pandemic on the price and availability of raw materials. In addition, some of our suppliers operate out of plants that were built several decades ago and may become less reliable as they approach their end of life stage. As a result, any disruption or delay in the supply of those materials from a particular supplier, an inability to source raw materials of appropriate quality, or loss of a supplier where we are unable to find a suitable alternative, may hinder our ability to fulfill customers’ orders on a timely and cost-effective basis or in the required quantities, which could result in order cancellations, decreased revenue and/or loss of market share and damage to our reputation. Further, volatility in costs and pricing can result in contractual disputes with suppliers or an inability to contract on mutually satisfactory terms. Adverse resolution of any such disputes or contract negotiations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of our suppliers have operations that are subject to the health, safety, security and environmental risks associated with the use of hazardous materials. Any health, safety, security or environmental-related incidents affecting these suppliers may result in significant regulatory actions, fines and other penalties, including restrictions, prohibitions or sanctions on their operations. Such consequences in turn could impair their ability to meet their obligations under present or future supply agreements. Any problems accessing raw materials from our suppliers may require us to obtain those raw materials from other sources which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and could require us to incur significantly higher transportation costs, higher costs of raw materials or significant delays, any of which could adversely affect our ability to meet our production requirements and delivery deadlines. Furthermore, as a result of our vertically-integrated business model, any difficulties in obtaining raw materials and/or adverse effects on the production of our products could further impair our downstream production process which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19. The outbreak of Covid-19 and measures to prevent its spread, including restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses and the related impact from the disruptions to transport flows, supply chains, customers’ businesses and associated reduction in consumer demand have had, and may continue to have, an impact on our performance. In the first half of 2020, our sales volumes around the world were impacted by weaker end applications demand, the closure of certain of our key customers’businesses and disruptions in certain parts of our supply chain, including the temporary shutdown of certain of our sites due to government stay-at-home measures. However, our professional hygiene, home and personal care and wood protection market fields in the U.S. and Europe, experienced resilient levels of demand. Although this increased demand had the effect of partially offsetting decreases elsewhere in the business, there can be no assurance that areas of increased demand will ----- be sustained. As the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the outbreak may continue to have a negative impact on our performance in certain sectors such as transportation and automotive. We have taken measures, and may take additional measures, intended to minimize the risk of the Covid-19 pandemic on our employees and operations, including encouraging employees to work remotely where possible. The increase in remote working has created and may continue to create additional operational risks for us, including risks related to employee productivity, satisfaction, mobility, tax, and training. We expect that the impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will ultimately depend on the duration of such disruptions, which will in turn depend on the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic, the impact of governmental regulations and the effects of more restrictive lockdown measures that might be imposed in response to the pandemic. Further, the Group has been and may continue to be impacted by the effect that similar disruptions have on its suppliers, vendors, distributors and customers. Although we believe that to date, the outbreak of Covid-19 has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, we are not able to predict the full impact and duration of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operations going forward due to a variety of variables, many of which are outside of our control, including ongoing lockdowns in various countries in which we operate, the availability of essential onsite personnel, the trajectory of new cases and variants around the world, the duration of any government imposed preventative measures, the efficacy of various governmental stimulus packages and the impact of the pandemic on global economy, the timeframe for widespread distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and the extent to which customer behavior is, or may be, permanently impacted. To the extent the Covid-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, liquidity and results of operations, it may also have the effect of intensifying many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. The Covid-19 pandemic may also cause other materially adverse impacts on our business and industry, each of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. Any future global pandemics may also have similar, or more severe, effects on global economic activity and on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.6,"The chemicals industry is subject to cyclicality, seasonality and volatility.","Our business is subject to cyclicality, as a function of general economic conditions. All of our products, other than very few exceptions such as food applications, are subject to cyclicality. Historically, the chemicals industry as a whole has experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply conditions, followed by periods when substantial capacity was added resulting in oversupply, declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins. These factors, among other things, make forecasting more difficult and a failure to properly manage the cyclicality of our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial conditions and results of operations. We are also subject to seasonality. Our products are used in various end applications for building and construction, transportation, automotive, electrical, food and feed, marine and home appliances. Most of these industries, particularly the building and construction sectors, have exhibited seasonal demand over the historical periods presented. For example, in the northern hemisphere, the summer paint and construction season drives increased mid-year coating sales that typically decline during the colder winter months. As a result, our working capital reflects similar trends with increased working capital requirements in the first half of the year, and a decrease in the second half of the year. Certain of our other products, such as resins and coatings, are also subject to seasonal demand due to the fact that they are used in market segments that have higher demand during spring and summer (e.g., paints for home maintenance and marine coatings). We believe this seasonality, has affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations. Our business is subject to volatility. Several factors that have historically contributed to volatile margins in the chemicals industry, and in our business particularly, most of which are beyond our control, include: - costs of raw materials; - macroeconomic volatility, described above, particularly in the electrical, construction and transportation sectors; - exchange rate fluctuations for producers with a global manufacturing footprint or distribution; - oversupply due to capacity expansions by existing or new competitors; - short-term utilization rate fluctuations due to planned turnarounds and unplanned production downtime; - regulatory requirements driving required technology and manufacturing changes; and ----- - political and economic conditions, which drive rapid changes in prices for our key raw materials. We believe this cyclicality, seasonality and volatility have affected, and will continue to affect, our business, prospects, financial conditions and results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—General Economic Conditions, Demand and Cyclicality in our End Applications and Supply Dynamics.”_ In addition, given the current uncertainty in the global economic environment (that could result in lower demand) and the implications of the variable supply-demand balance in the chemicals industry, increasing supply could increase pressure on our margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The ability of both our customers and suppliers to access necessary credit may be limited for a number of reasons, including adverse economic conditions. If our customers are unable to access credit facilities they may be unable to pay for products we supply them in a timely fashion or at all, which may adversely affect our business by reducing our sales and increasing our exposure to doubtful debts, thereby reducing our profitability. As of June 30, 2021, our provision for doubtful debt was €12 million. Additionally, any inability by our suppliers to access credit facilities, for whatever reason, may adversely affect our business by impacting availability and increasing prices for raw materials and transportation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

In particular, we are subject to a number of increasingly stringent local, state, and international environmental and health protection requirements with regard to, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the use, handling and disposal of chemicals and hazardous substances. Moreover, stringent and evolving regulations apply to the machinery and equipment that we use to operate our business. Compliance with such laws and regulations requires expenditures (including capital expenditures for remediation and containment work), research and development expenditure to upgrade products and plants and/or increased operating costs, which would have an impact on our cost of production and our results of operations and may be difficult to pass through to our customers. A breach of any such laws or regulations may result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to material monetary fines and penalties, civil or criminal sanctions, or other liabilities. We may also be required to expend funds to remediate any non-compliance with any such laws or regulations. Such remediation work can last for extended periods of time, exceeding 10 years, and we are typically reliant on third-party contractors to conduct such remediation. Furthermore, environmental laws may expose us to liability for environmental damage that our current or former sites cause, including damage to neighboring landowners or residents, particularly as a result of the contamination of soil, groundwater or surface water, and especially drinking water, or to natural resources. We may also be liable for the damages caused to human health by the presence of hazardous containing materials (including asbestos and other radioactive materials) at the premises owned or operated by us, as well as for any on-site environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances whose transportation or treatment we or companies we acquired arranged or conducted and we may also be liable for any environmental damage (such as contamination) caused by former owner(s) of the sites that we currently own and/or operate. In particular, some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment, which could result in liability for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that is expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and increased liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs for compliance. As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, respectively, we made a provision for €22.4 million and €23.0 million, respectively, for ecological clean-ups. Environmental laws and regulations may result in an increase in our costs of operations. The environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits that govern our operations tend to become increasingly more stringent over time, including as a result of greater public scrutiny of environmental issues, and we could in the future assume additional obligations and therefore incur substantial incremental costs to ----- ensure our continued regulatory compliance. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintentional noncompliance. If we do not accurately predict and adequately provision for the amount or timing of costs of any future compliance or if we misinterpret our obligations under any of these regulatory changes, we may be deemed to be in violation of environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or permits. Given the nature of our business, violations of environmental, health and safety requirements, whether current or future, may result in substantial fines or penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions, clean-up costs and other remediation or restoration requirements, claims for personal injury or property damages, the installation of costly pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities.

Any impacts to our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. For example, extreme weather events may result in adverse physical impacts to our sites or portions of our infrastructure, which could disrupt our supply chain and ultimately our business operations. In addition, disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and interruption of deliveries and higher costs. Climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business, including the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to resume operations. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. The chemicals industry may become a target for future regulation regarding climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, or financial condition. Emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”) are a standard byproduct of our production process. Over the past few decades, concerns about the relationship between GHG and global climate change have resulted in increased levels of scrutiny from regulators and the public alike, and have led to proposed and enacted regulations at both national and international levels, to monitor, regulate and control carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. In the EU, our emissions are regulated under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (“EU",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,"ETS”), an EU-wide trading system for industrial GHG emissions. See “Regulation—EU Regulations—",13.2.1,"We may lose key customers for certain of our products, which could materially affect our business.","Although we do not rely on any single customer for a substantial portion of our revenues, sales of certain of our products depend on long-term agreements with certain key customers. If we lose any key customers, we may be unable to find alternative buyers to purchase the same products in the same quantities, if at all, at similar price levels and/or on the same terms. In 2020, our top ten customers accounted for 27.5% of our sales volume, while our largest customer accounted for 6.4% of our sales volume. If unsold, most of our products cannot be easily stored as inventory to be sold to future customers. Across much of our business, some of our largest contracts typically have minimum volume requirements, although in practice we usually try to find a solution with our customers if they cannot meet these requirements. Within any given product type or end application we may rely on a small number of key customers. If these customers were to discontinue our relationship, the lost business from that pipeline would be difficult to replace. We may lose customers due to, among other things, industry consolidation, customer dissatisfaction or competition, which could lead to a significant increase in inventories or decrease in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. For example, in 2019 we lost the entire business of one of our top 10 customers (to whom we had sold 10,000 tons of products in 2018) to a competitor. See “—We _face intense competition in the development, production and sale of our products.”_ We face certain risks relating to the loss of customers as we do not always enter into long-term contracts with our customers. While we have long-term supply agreements in place with many of our key customers, in certain businesses, much of our business is conducted on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term contracts. Accordingly, some customers may elect to discontinue business with us with limited or no notice and with limited recourse. Additionally, certain of our product lines contribute disproportionately to our profitability. Thus, the loss of customers for these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. New laws and regulations may be introduced in the future in addition to those laws and regulations currently applicable to our product groups, and this could result in additional compliance costs, confiscation, recall or monetary fines, any of which could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our product groups. Furthermore, if a significant customer or group of customers were to have any permit, license, registration or authorization revoked in a manner that impacts their business or ability to operate, this could in turn result in lower purchases from us and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, from time to time we rely on co-producer transactions where we contract to sell certain of our products to competitor chemical producers. These transactions are governed by non binding orders, which set out the estimated amount to be sold over a specified amount of time, and can generally be canceled on short notice. These contracts have been canceled in the past and may be canceled in the future due to, among other things, declining general economic conditions or oversupply in the markets where these competitors operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

See “Regulation—EU Regulations—",13.2.2,Increased energy costs or disruptions in energy supplies could affect our production activities.,"Our business is dependent on the steady supply of significant amounts of energy, for our production processes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our energy costs amounted to €56 million, or 3.2% of our revenue for the same period. Energy costs are affected by various factors, including the availability of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices and regulatory decisions. In particular, prices for oil, gas and electricity have been volatile in recent years. Such volatility may increase as a result of political instability, OPEC actions, or other factors. More recently, a reduced availability of alternative energy sources and reduced supply from net exporters such as Russia and Norway has led to a shortage of natural gas in Europe, resulting in an increase in natural gas prices. Further, any increase in the price of natural gas could lead to increased consumption of oil, resulting in a knock on effect on oil prices. Any significant decrease in energy availability could impair our production operations. In addition, increases in market prices, transportation costs, grid fees or taxes (including by reduction of tax benefits) associated with the supply of energy would increase our operating costs and, thus, may negatively affect our business if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to our customers. Any inability or delay in passing on increases in energy costs to our customers or any interruption or shortage of energy supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

See “Regulation—EU Regulations—",13.2.3,We may not be able to maximize the utilization of our production facilities.,"Our business is materially influenced by the degree to which we utilize our production assets to achieve maximum production volumes. In order to maximize production and efficiency, we strive to operate our production facilities around-the-clock and at near-maximum capacity. Moreover, certain of our facilities have minimum capacities below which they cannot be properly operated. Our only planned production outages occur to perform necessary inspections, tests to comply with industry regulations and any maintenance activities that may be necessary. We attempt to minimize the need for facility downtime and maximize the useful life of our production facilities by undertaking regular maintenance closures to perform necessary inspections and testing to comply with industry regulations and to carry out any necessary maintenance activities. We aim to schedule these closures during seasonal periods of reduced demand and in coordination with our raw material suppliers’ planned shutdowns. For example, we schedule maintenance closures of most of our European production facilities during August and December of each year to correspond with generally reduced demand during those periods. When possible, we seek to limit the effect of scheduled outages on our results by increasing inventory ahead of planned turnarounds and by coordinating with our customers to manage expectations in terms of product availability and logistical changes such as changes in the location from which we will ship our chemical products. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively implement our strategy of maximizing utilization of assets in accordance with our plans, or at all, or that we will be able to increase inventory to off-set the impact of any outage. In addition, we may be subject to prolonged unplanned outages, should a critical part of our plant reach its end of life stage sooner than anticipated and cease to be operational. For example, unplanned outages have had, and may in the future have, an effect on our ability to meet customer orders, resulting in lost revenues, market share and a materially adverse impact on our reputation which can result in an adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, even if such outages are covered by insurance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

See “Regulation—EU Regulations—",13.2.4,We are limited in our ability to adjust and optimize the quantities of products that we produce.,"Our production and process strategy is founded on a vertically integrated business model. At each production step, a number of different products can either be used internally in downstream production or sold to customers. However, the vast majority of intermediates are used internally. Our ability to vary production quantities of downstream products of intermediates is fairly limited since it is expensive to stop and restart production of intermediates, therefore for cost efficiency purposes we produce intermediates around the clock. Consequently, although we can adjust the production quantities of specific products within a certain range, we may not be able to do so on a cost-effective basis, or sufficiently to optimize the quantities of products we produce. Although our integrated production model is aimed at optimizing the allocation of our production capacity to manufacture the highest-margin products at any given time, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do this. For example, because many of our products cannot be stored for more than a short period of time, our ability to keep inventories of products to be sold at a later time is limited. In addition, our ability to utilize our products can also be affected by external factors, such as a decline in customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent we are unable to adjust our production process to demand, we would suffer losses on inventory or lower margins due sub-optimal allocation of production capacity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Compliance with HSE laws and regulations has required and will continue to require substantial expense, and any failure to comply with such laws or regulations or failure to obtain necessary approvals may lead to criminal violations, civil and administrative fines and/or changes in the way we operate our facilities, which could increase our capital expenditure or operating costs. Moreover, HSE laws and regulations are subject to periodic changes and new laws and regulations are frequently adopted. New laws and regulations could prohibit certain of our production activities, outlaw certain of our raw materials or products or simply make it prohibitively expensive or commercially unreasonable for us to comply with such laws and regulations and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The discovery of as-of-yet unknown dangers caused by exposure to such agents and processes may cause us to incur unforeseen expense in order to improve our current levels of safety or to pay compensation to anyone who is harmed. If any such dangers are not identified prior to the marketing and sale of the relevant products, we may be required to withdraw such products from the market, perform lengthy additional clinical trials or change the labelling of our products, any of which would materially and adversely impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our operating activities create a significant risk of environmental contamination or other forms of pollution and are subject to extensive environmental protection laws and regulations adopted by the EU, the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We must comply with a broad range of laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the testing, manufacturing, labeling and safety analysis of our products or the products of our suppliers and failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could have material consequences for our business. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the U.S., these types of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue. In particular, in the EU, our products and raw materials produced in, exported from or imported into and/or sold in the EU are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. The main regulations relating to safety of substances and chemicals affecting our industry are the European Union Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006) (“REACH”). Both impose significant obligations on the chemicals industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of basic chemicals and semi-specialty chemical products. REACH is reviewed annually and, as a result, new regulations that further affect our businesses and operations may be proposed in the future. In addition, the European Union Regulation on classification, labeling and packaging (Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008) (“CLP”), imposes further obligations in relation to the classification, labeling and packaging of these chemicals. Since 2010 we have been required to register roughly 150 substances under REACH for a total cost of approximately €10 million. We currently believe that future spending on REACH compliance is estimated to be around €1 million per year over the next 5 years; we have made provisions in our accounts for such amounts. In connection with REACH and CLP, any raw material, chemical or substance, including our products, as well as being subject to the registration, classification, labeling and packaging requirements that these regulations impose, could be classified as having a toxicological or health-related effect on the environment, on users of our products or on our employees. In particular, REACH requires a costly and time-consuming authorization process for any chemical that has been deemed to be a substance of very high concern and which has been listed by the European Commission in Annex XIV to REACH to remain on the market (the “Authorization List”). As of December 31, 2020, the ECHA (as defined below) had classified 5 of our products as substances of very high concern under REACH: DOP/DEHP, DIBP, TMA, HHPA and MHHPA. DOP/ DEHP has been included in the Authorization List. However, as its current application is in medical devices (blood bags), it is currently exempt from authorization. We are supporting the supply chain in their efforts to prepare an application for authorization should medical devices not benefit from the authorization exemption anymore. This authorization would allow us to keep selling DOP/DEHP to blood bag set producers. DIBP has also been included in the Authorization List. However, as it is used by Polynt and its customers only as an ----- intermediate, it is exempt from authorization. TMA has not been included in the Authorization List. Should it be included in the Authorization List, our business would be marginally affected as almost all of the uses of the substance have to be regarded as intermediate or monomer uses which are exempted from authorization. HHPA, has also not yet been included in the Authorization List. It is used as an intermediate in approximately 80% of our products and, therefore, the business would not be substantially affected by a possible inclusion on the Authorization List. However, approximately 20% of the HHPA and the entirety of the MHHPA that we use, which, combined, accounted for 1.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, are used in ways that could lead to the need to submit an application for authorization, should these be included in the Authorization List. The inclusion of any product on the Authorization List triggers various obligations to produce information on the product and its properties to customers and downstream users. As part of the authorization process, we would have to demonstrate that the risks to human health or the environment associated with uses of this substance are adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits of its use outweigh the risks. We must also analyze whether there are safer suitable alternatives or technologies available. If authorization is obtained it will only be for a limited period (typically seven years) after which there is a risk that such authorization will not be renewed or that an alternative would have been found. While we pursue research and development in substance characterization and in the possible substitution of critical substances, an inability to use certain chemicals under REACH could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In the U.S., our operations are subject to Federal and State regulation of chemicals, including the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). In recent years, there have been a number of proposals to significantly amend or reform the TSCA that have been introduced in the U.S., including via federal legislation and the EPA-managed initiatives. On June 22, 2016, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety For the 21[st] Century Act was signed into law, which amended TSCA in significant ways. The law includes a mandatory requirement for EPA to evaluate existing chemicals within established deadlines, provides for risk-based chemical assessments, creates more public transparency on chemical information, and provides funding for the EPA to carry out its responsibilities under TSCA. Further TSCA amendments or reform could make the TSCA more in line with the European Union’s REACH regime or otherwise make it more stringent. Changes to U.S. federal chemicals laws could result in increased obligations to demonstrate that the health or environmental risks of our substances are adequately controlled. Similar regulations and requirements apply in other jurisdiction in which we operate or into which we sell our products. In addition, from time to time, we incur remediation costs at our current facilities and decommissioning costs associated with closing production facilities. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 we had provisions of €23.0 million and €22.4 million, respectively, for anticipated ecological remediation costs that may be necessary at certain facilities. Given the nature of our chemical operations, should historical or future environmental conditions be discovered, the Group may incur significant future remediation costs including fines and potential damages. See “Regulation”, “Business—Environmental and Health and Safety Matters”. Complying with the obligations described above is expensive and time consuming and leads to increased production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. We may also face fines or other sanctions if we fail to comply with these or new regulations applicable to our business. For more information about the material regulations affecting our business see “Regulation”. Furthermore, any changes in chemical safety regulations, delays in regulatory decisions due to Covid-19, changes in our ability to provide input to regulatory bodies in a timely manner, or changes in the cost of compliance with such regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our market positions in various products and markets throughout the world. Our competitors include some of the world’s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources. Our competitors vary across our product lines and range from large chemical companies to smaller regional companies. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and technology and marketing resources, they may be able to manufacture products more economically, may be able to better withstand changes in market conditions and may, from time to time, benefit more than us from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. ----- Furthermore, some of our competitors are owned or partially owned by foreign governments. Stateownership may provide a competitive advantage to those competitors because the state may have goals such as investing in the economies of their respective countries or providing local employment, and therefore may continue to provide capacity and products even at unprofitable price points, creating downward pricing pressure on our products. We may also face competition in our markets from chemical producers in the Middle East who benefit from lower-priced raw materials due to abundant crude oil and natural gas supplies. Additionally, exploration of chemical production from shale gas findings in North America poses an increased risk of North American producers or new entrants who have access to an alternative and less expensive raw material. Further, we face competition in Europe from Chinese intermediates producers, who have increased their supply into Europe as a result of the tariffs between China and the United States. Competition from new entrants may also increase because the technology we use has become more available and less expensive in the Specialties sector. The resulting pressure of increased competition on our margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, a number of our customers are participants in markets that are undergoing consolidation. We could lose individual customers to competitors if they are acquired by, or consolidate with, other companies that have relationships with our competitors. In addition, ongoing consolidation in various industries continues to create individual customers with greater purchasing power and competitors with greater financial and other resources. In addition, key customers across Europe face a competitive threat from low-cost producers in Asia in all of our product classes. If our customers are unable to successfully compete with Asian manufacturers or other competitors, such customers may decrease the size of their purchases from us going forward, or cease making such purchases altogether, and we may not be able to compensate the loss with increasing sales to the Asian manufacturers.

However, the results of our R&D may not be commercially viable. We operate 13 R&D centers across Europe, Americas and Asia, with over 100 full-time employees dedicated to research and development as of December 31, 2020. We may not be able to develop products that adequately address our customers’ needs. In addition, the timely commercialization of products that we are developing may be disrupted or delayed by manufacturing or other technical difficulties, industry acceptance or insufficient industry size to support a new product, competitors’ new products, and difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage. These disruptions or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. ----- In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred aggregate R&D expenses of €22.8 million, €21.1 million and €18.6 million, respectively. A significant amount of capital needs to be dedicated to develop new products, for which the process is lengthy and results are uncertain. In addition, we incur development costs in connection with the production of our new products, as well as other activities to facilitate their commercialization. As a result, future results of operations depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The product development, manufacturing and commercialization process is time-consuming. We must develop, test and manufacture our products as well as successfully register them in each relevant jurisdiction. All of our products must meet and continue to comply with regulatory and safety standards in each of the markets they are to be commercialized. Delays in the development, the regulatory approval processes (including as a result of Covid-19) could impact our ability to successfully launch or the expected profitability of new products, which in turn could adversely affect our business. Our products under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as expected or may face greater than expected competition. Our failure to develop new products, processes or applications could make us less competitive. In addition, our new products may be unable to achieve their planned value or obtain necessary regulatory approval. Successfully developing and manufacturing new products also depends on our ability to secure, on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, the required raw materials. The end applications in which our customers operate are subject to periodic technological changes, ongoing product improvements, product substitution and changes in product requirements. Increased competition from existing or newly-developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality to our products may negatively affect demand for our products. We work to identify, develop and market innovative products on a timely basis to meet our customers’ changing requirements and competitive challenges. However, if we are unable to successfully maintain or further develop our product portfolio ahead of our competitors who may develop alternative materials, procedures or technologies that replace or improve on our current products, our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete and customers may elect to source comparable products from competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Potential new products that appear promising during the development stage may fail to reach the market or have only limited commercial success. This could be attributable to any number of factors, including efficacy or safety concerns, an inability or delay to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in certain geographic markets (including as a result of Covid-19), difficulties in manufacturing or excessive manufacturing costs, erosion of patent terms as a result of a lengthy development period, claims of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others, an inability to differentiate the product adequately from its competitors or inability to anticipate or satisfy our customers’ needs.

It is possible that we identify targets that are not appropriate for our business or that we pay more to acquire the target than the value we are able to realize from it. Any acquisition that we make could be subject to a number of risks, including: (a) problems with effective integration of operations; (b) the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships; (c) increased operating costs; (d) costs related to achieving or maintaining compliance with laws, rules or regulations; (e) the loss of key employees of the acquired company; (f) exposure to unanticipated liabilities; and (g) difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, despite the due diligence we perform, we may encounter performance, funding or cash flow issues with the acquired business or inadvertently or unknowingly acquire actual or potential liabilities or defects, including legal claims, claims for breach of contract, employment related claims, environmental liabilities, hazardous materials or liability for hazardous materials or tax liabilities. If any of the above were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, acquisitions of businesses in countries where we are not already operating may present additional challenges due to cultural and linguistic differences and the difficulties presented by integrating and managing a business that is geographically more remote. Moreover, significant acquisitions may result in unfavorable external perceptions of the transaction or us, creating the potential for ratings downgrades or adversely affecting the market price of the Notes. Further, we may use debt financing for any acquisitions, which would increase our debt service requirements, or we may use operating cash flows to finance acquisitions, which would decrease the amount of cash on our balance sheet. In order to manage any acquisitions we successfully complete, we will need to expand and continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems. In addition, making acquisitions or integrating any acquired business could diverts management attention from the operations or our current businesses, which could adversely affect our financial condition ----- or results of operations.

These hazards may cause serious harm to persons and property, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, and environmental contamination, which could lead to fines or work stoppage injunctions, cleanup costs and lawsuits. As part of our regular maintenance of our facilities, we may also be required to shut down our facilities for a certain period of time. Should maintenance be required more frequently, or should shutdowns be required for longer periods, this would have an adverse effect on our sales and operating results. The occurrence of material operating problems at any of our facilities may diminish or eliminate our ability to manufacture products or harm our customer goodwill. Further, from time to time, we may experience capacity limitations in our manufacturing operations. See “—The occurrence of operational _interruptions or problems at our facilities or to our transport infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations”._ Our plant, equipment and other assets are insured for property damage (including environmental liability) and business interruption risks, and our business as a whole is insured for general and product liability risks. In addition, we carry marine cargo insurance, cyber insurance, crime (including computer fraud) insurance, employment practice liability insurance and director and officer liability insurance. However, each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices, and we may incur liabilities that are excluded from coverage or in excess of our coverage limits. Furthermore, such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. For example, since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, many insurers have reduced the scope of coverage for losses incurred due to pandemics. Our insurance policies may not fully cover all damages to persons and property, the environment, business interruptions and other liabilities. Should there be an event that causes serious harm to persons or property or the environment, or a significant interruption of our production activities, against which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Even if we are fully-insured, accidents that cause serious harm to persons or property could result in significant adverse publicity and reputational harm, which, independent of financial impairments from unor under-insured losses, could lead to a loss of business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage or on commercially unacceptable terms. Therefore, in the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and/or our premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies may increase significantly on the coverage that we currently maintain. If insurance is not available at economically acceptable premiums, our insurance coverage may not cover the full scope and extent of claims against us or losses that we incur, including, but not limited to, claims for environmental or industrial accidents, occupational illnesses, pollution and product liability and business interruption. Furthermore, we could be required to increase our debt or divert resources from other investments in our business to discharge any uninsured claims. Costs associated with unanticipated events in excess of our insurance coverage, or a failure to maintain such coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Some environmental laws, regulations and court decisions impose liability on present and former owners, operators or users of, or the generators of waste disposed at, facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation, negligence or knowledge of contamination. From time to time, we are required to investigate, manage and remediate, including funding the restoration of impacted natural resources, contamination at or arising from these sites as well as at properties where we formerly operated and/or at closed sites that we still own and occupy. We also could be responsible for investigating and cleaning up contamination at off-site locations where we have sent our waste for disposal or for treatment of its hazardous properties. In connection with contaminated properties, as well as our operations generally, we also could be subject to claims by government authorities and other third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury or property or natural resources damages resulting from contamination or exposure caused by our operations, facilities or products. The discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at or in connection with our facilities, could result in substantial unanticipated costs. See “Business—Environmental and Health and Safety Matters” and “Regulation”. While we may to an extent be protected by contractual indemnities from prior owners or operators against some environmental liabilities related to known contamination or have insurance coverage relating to such costs, there is a risk that we will be unable to recover any or all potential costs under such indemnity provisions or insurance contracts in all cases. If we dispose of any sites, we may also have to indemnify subsequent owners or operators against some environmental liabilities and contamination remediation for such sites that we formerly operated. We could be required to establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or liabilities and, if we fail to accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impacts on our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition in any period in which such costs need to be incurred could be material.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

See “Regulation—EU Regulations—",13.2.16,"Our operations require the use of several different currencies, exposing us to both transaction and translation effects of exchange rate fluctuations.","We currently conduct our business operations across multiple jurisdictions, including Italy, Germany, France, Poland, Spain, Norway, the United Kingdom, China, South Korea, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Canada and the U.S. Although our reporting currency is the Euro, a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in currencies other than the Euro, predominantly the U.S. dollar. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 40% of our revenue was Euro-denominated, approximately 34% was U.S. dollardenominated or U.S. dollar-linked with the remainder denominated in other currencies. Our business is subject to risks normally associated with international operations operating in multiple currencies, including the need to convert currencies that may be received for sales of our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services, which, especially given the recent volatility of the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. Although we engage in some currency hedging, there can be no assurance that such hedging will be sufficient to effectively limit the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations. ----- In addition, we translate our local currency financial results into euro based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. During times of a strengthening euro, our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer euro. During periods of high volatility or significant fluctuations in exchange rates, especially in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, the translation of our local results into euro at the end of a given period may not accurately represent the value of the sales and earnings at the time they were recorded. Because we currently have significant operations located outside the EU, especially in the U.S., we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase or decrease of 10% in USD currency exposure would impact profit or loss and equity by approximately €2.1 million and € 2.6 million, respectively. As a result of our global customer and operations base, our Group companies occasionally enter into contracts expressed in currencies different from their operating currencies. Because these contracts are often settled and/or executed over a certain period of time, we are exposed to the risk that the relative exchange rate will fluctuate unfavorably between execution and full performance of the contracts. Although we engage in some currency hedging to mitigate the effects of currency transaction risk, the strength of our geographic diversification generally allows us to make use of natural hedges within our foreign currency denominated operations, including through matching the currency of our sales to the currency of the purchases of raw materials and other production costs. The revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our Group companies results in either financial income or financial expense on our income statement for the relevant period. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had financial income from exchange rate gains of €9.0 million and €9.4 million, respectively, and financial expense on exchange rate losses of €31.6 million and €4.3 million, respectively, mainly related to the exchange rate effect on outstanding loans denominated in USD and intercompany loans for some of the subsidiaries.

We employ staff located around the world to serve our global customer base. Our business is, therefore, subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many distinct jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include exposure to the following: - unexpected or adverse changes in laws or regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions; - adverse changes in the general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which we operate; - inability to enforce intellectual property rights; - compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions becoming burdensome; - increasing transportation and other shipping costs; - variation in business practices; - the imposition of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls; - adverse changes in export duties, exchange controls, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses; - the complexity of managing competing and overlapping tax regimes; - disruptions caused by actual or threatened export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses; - staffing difficulties, national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes; - the threat of government expropriation; ----- - region to region fluctuations in key raw material costs; - the imposition of any price controls or anti-dumping rulings; - litigation risk and possible loss contingencies arising from Covid-19 and its adverse effects, including commercial contract disputes, employee matters, contract counterparty insolvency, force majeure, insurance claims and other arrangements; - the imposition of government restrictions on movement or gatherings; and - difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables. The occurrence of any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We have operations in developing countries such as Malaysia and Brazil, and we may expand our business and operations into other high-growth emerging markets, including other parts of Asia and Central and South America. Our operations in those countries are subject to the risks inherent in operating in developing countries, including legal and regulatory uncertainties (such as difficulties in securing intellectual property rights) as well as rapid changes in economic or political conditions in emerging markets, which may result in greater risks of inflation and fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, and a negative impact on the demand for our products. In particular, with respect to the plant land, buildings, equipment and facilities located in Riverside Chemical Park, Chunjiang Town, Xinbei District, owned by Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) Co. Ltd. (the “Changzhou Site”), on November 30, 2020, the Binjiang Economic Development Zone, as local Chinese government authority, in order to promote the high quality development of the Yangtze River economic belt, entrusted Changzhou Zhengan House Demolition Co.

The Group expects that the Changzhou Site will be decommissioned, vacated and handed to the Chinese local government authority by the end of year 2021 (and that the final instalment payment will be made 30 days following the Group vacating the site) and that the main equipment will be relocated to the Group’s sites based in Mexico, Italy and Malaysia (the “Changzhou Site’s Closure and",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

See “Regulation—EU Regulations—",13.2.18,,"_Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations—Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Emissions Trading Rules”. We_ have been allotted CO2 emissions credits by the EU ETS for 211,201 tons in 2020, covering approximately 65% of our CO2 emissions falling within the scope of EU ETS. While there can be no assurance of this fact, we believe that our current allotment of credits will remain the same in 2021, so that we will need to continue to purchase credits for approximately 35% of our emissions. However, the EU ETS is anticipated to become progressively more stringent over time and so we can provide no assurances that in the future we will receive the same amount of credits. In addition, any increase in the cost of purchasing ETS credits could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We are required to monitor and report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) annual GHG emissions from certain of our U.S. facilities. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) which subject the GHG emissions of certain newly constructed or modified facilities to pre-construction and operating permitting requirements. Pursuant to these requirements, newly ----- constructed or modified facilities in the U.S. with the potential to emit certain quantities of GHGs are required to implement “best available control technology,” which can include carbon efficiency standards, GHG emission concentration limits, specific technology requirements or other measures. Significant uncertainty exists as to how newer or stricter GHG regulations will in the future impact stationary sources, such as our facilities in the U.S., and what costs or operational changes these regulations may require. In addition, in 2012 and 2016, the EPA has issued final regulations under the CAA that establish air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. The EPA also issued a request for data and information relating to a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities in 2016, but withdrew such request in March 2017 under the Trump administration. Under President Biden, the EPA has initiated a rulemaking with respect to the regulation of methane from oil and natural gas production. Significant uncertainty exists as to future regulation of these activities under the CAA. We continue to monitor the situation closely. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and numerous U.S. states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted any such legislation at this time, it, or certain U.S. states, may do so in the future, along with other countries (in addition to the EU), and we cannot yet predict the form such regulation will take (such as a cap and trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements, for example, to install emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage our GHG emissions program, or address other regulatory obligations. Such requirements could also adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw materials we use for fuel. For example, in August 2015, the EPA released a final version of the Clean Power Plan (“CPP”), which sought to reduce GHG emissions from power plants. On June 19, 2019, the EPA issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule (“ACE”) to replace the CPP. The ACE rule established emissions guidelines for states to use in developing plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, focusing on heat rate improvements to define the “best system of emission reductions” and unit-specific standards of performance. Plans are required to be submitted by individual states by 2022. On January 19, 2021, the District Court for the District of Washington D.C. vacated the ACE rule and remanded to the EPA for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The EPA has indicated that it is now considering a new regulation to replace the CPP and ACE. See “Regulation—U.S. Regulations—Clean Air Act” and“Regulation—U.S. _Regulation—Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Rules.”_ At the international level, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of GHGs pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Kyoto Protocol”. Although the U.S. is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol at this time, all EU member states have ratified it. Furthermore, more than 100 nations, including the U.S. and China, have agreed to the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce GHG emissions. As a result of commitments made at the UN climate conference in Durban, South Africa in December 2011, certain members of the international community negotiated a treaty at the December 2015 Conference of Parties in Paris (the “Paris Agreement”). This Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, requires developed countries to set targets for emissions reductions once the Paris Agreement is adopted by those individual countries within their respective national or federal law. Additional measures requiring reductions in GHG emissions may be implemented by other countries in which we operate, including, for example, the EU which has set ambitious targets for reducing net emission by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050. Compliance with current or future GHG regulations governing our operations, including those discussed above, may result in significantly increased capital expenditures to install more environmentally efficient technology or the purchase of allowances to emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Future regulations could have a significant impact on us and any costs that we may be required to incur with respect to these or any other future requirements could be significant. In addition, such requirements could also adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw materials we use for fuel, and ultimately reduce demand for our products. The realization of any or all of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

In particular, our international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Italian Legislative Decree 231 of 2001 (the “231 Decree”), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the “Bribery Act”), similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the United Nations, the European Union and Office of Foreign Asset Control. The FCPA, together with similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to public officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The provisions of the Bribery Act extend beyond the bribery of foreign public officials and are more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. The 231 Decree provides for the administrative liability of a corporate entity for crimes committed in its interest or to its advantage by certain individuals such as its employees, directors and representatives. The 231 Decree crimes include, among others, crimes committed in the context of dealings with the public administration (including bribery, misappropriation of public contributions, and fraud to the detriment of the state), corporate crimes, environmental crimes and crimes of manslaughter or serious injury, in violation of provisions on health and safety at the workplace. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anticorruption laws and economic sanctions. As we operate facilities in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world, we rely on our management structure, regulatory and legal resources and effective operation of our compliance program to direct, manage and monitor the activities of these employees. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures and compliance programs will protect us from deliberate, reckless or inadvertent acts of our employees or agents that contravene our compliance policies and/or violate applicable laws. Failure to control, for example, anti-competitive behavior, bribery and corruption, or breaches of trade sanctions could result in substantial penalties, including civil and criminal liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation. Our international operations could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union and their member countries. In addition, economic sanctions programs may restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries. As a result of doing business in foreign countries, we are exposed to a risk of violating anticorruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we operate. Any future expansion of our worldwide operations, including our employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate, could increase the risk of violations of anti-corruption or similar laws. Furthermore, any future expansion into developing countries could pose increased risks as some of these countries may lack a developed legal system and have high perceived levels of corruption. Violations of these laws are punishable by civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, revocations or restrictions of licenses, monitoring or self-reporting obligations, exclusion from government reimbursement programs, as well as possible imprisonment.

To the extent that the performance of the United Kingdom economy declines, does not improve or improves only over an extended period of time, our business, prospects, financial condition or result of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The legal, political and economic uncertainty created by Brexit, including the risk that other countries may decide to leave the European Union in the future could have a material adverse effect on global economic and market conditions. As a result, there can be no assurance that these or any other factors related to Brexit will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Euro Area countries and their potential inability to meet their future financial obligations, the overall stability of the Euro, given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Euro Area countries, Brexit and volatility in the value of the Euro. These concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more Euro Area countries. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could have negative impacts on capital markets, including reductions in asset values, increased foreign currency fluctuations and greater volatility, potentially impacting our ability and that of our customers, suppliers and lenders to obtain financing and access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, the availability of supplies and materials, and the demand for our products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategies or that implementing these strategies will sustain or improve, and not harm, our results of operations. For example, we may not be able to increase our manufacturing efficiency or asset utilization or achieve other cost savings. In addition, the costs involved in implementing our strategies may be significantly greater than we currently anticipate. Our business strategies are based on assumptions about future demand for our products, new products and applications we are developing and, on our ability, to optimize utilization of our existing and future production facilities. Each of these factors depends on, among other things, differentiating our offerings and avoiding the commoditization of key chemistries in our products, our ability to innovate to keep up with changes in technology, customer preferences or the competitive environment, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, our ability to acquire and integrate businesses, financing operations and product development activities, maintaining and expanding high-quality an efficient manufacturing operations, efficiently managing our supply chains, responding timely to competitive and regulatory changes, ----- complying with competition regulations in various jurisdictions, accessing quality raw materials in a cost-effective and timely manner, obtaining or securing adequate intellectual property rights, and retaining and attracting highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel. These challenges may be accentuated as a result of widespread remote working arrangements due to measures adopted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. We may not be able to implement our strategy of optimizing utilization of assets in accordance with our plans or at all. Additionally, even if we achieve our goals, the cost of implementing these initiatives could ultimately exceed their benefits. Any failure to develop, revise or implement our business strategies in a timely and effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Since the economic downturn in global markets in 2008, 2009 and, more recently, 2020, macroeconomic volatility has made it more difficult to predict GDP development in many economies, resulting in frequent modifications to GDP growth expectations published by economic research institutions, as well as in adjustments by market research specialists, sometimes giving rise to significant revisions to growth expectations for specific markets. Furthermore, the ongoing uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic may have a continued adverse effect on economic and geopolitical developments. As a result, many companies in the chemical and biotech industries, including ourselves, may find it difficult to accurately model and predict the prospects for their businesses, and it may be difficult for investors to use historical financial information as an indicator for future results. Any failure by us to accurately predict the economic environment and the development of our business could lead to misjudgments as to the level of production capacities needed for our business, increase the risk of failed investments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Our senior managers and key personnel have extensive knowledge of our business, the industry, market trends and our customers, and are therefore critical to our continued growth and development. Because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel. We may face difficulties finding personnel with the necessary skills given the specialized demands of our business. We may need to offer increasingly high levels of compensation and benefits to continue to attract the necessary personnel, which could significantly increase our costs. In addition, we may be unable to replace any departing employees in a timely manner. For example, recently, a shortage in factory workers across the U.S. has resulted in a high turnover as workers move employers as they are offered higher wages. Any inability to recruit, train or retain such personnel could hinder our ability to develop and market successful new products and to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Many of our employees reside in countries in which employment laws provide our employees with significant bargaining power or other rights that may require us to spend more time and expenses when altering or amending employees’ terms of employment or making staff reductions. Most of our employees in Europe are represented by unions or works councils and generally must approve changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits. We may not be able to renew any such collective bargaining agreements or work council agreements on terms similar to current terms, or renegotiate such agreements on acceptable terms. Additionally, in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, national unions and foreign governments may be unable to reach agreements, which could result in work stoppages that are out of our control. Furthermore, if a collective bargaining agreement or a works council agreement is negotiated at higher cost, such costs may need to be absorbed by us, or be passed through to customers in the form of higher prices which may make us less competitive. Further, a labor disturbance or work stoppage at any of our facilities as a result of any changes to our employment terms and conditions or for any other reason could have a material adverse effect on such facility’s ----- operations and, potentially, on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

These commitments are partially covered by pension schemes, pension funds, special purpose funds and insurance policies. The amount of obligations is based on certain actuarial assumptions, including discount factors, life expectancy, pension trends and future salary development as well as expected interest rates applicable to the applicable plan, scheme or fund assets. As of June 30, 2021, our total provisions for pensions amounted to €18 million. If the actual results deviate from these assumptions, this could result in a considerable increase of the pension commitments and thus to higher allocations to pension reserves in future years and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In Brazil, United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, we sponsor defined benefit plans which provide retirement savings benefits to eligible employees. Generally, employees are eligible to participate in the plan upon hire. The plans are subject to employment and taxation rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, including regulations and rules that would require us to increase funding to these plans if they are determined to be underfunded.

We record goodwill in connection with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and the liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed in business combinations. Our goodwill accounted for 4.53%, 4.33% and 4.59% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, our total goodwill, amounted to €65.8 million, representing 3.85% of our total assets. Goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition and, in accordance with IFRS, is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations and a variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to our income statement. The application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment in preparing relevant projections. If our estimates and judgment are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and the impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner. If the fair value declines, we may need to recognize goodwill impairment in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we perform valuation of the intangible assets to determine the relative fair value to be assigned to each asset. The intangible assets are expensed or amortized using the straight-line approach over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets. We may record impairments on goodwill or intangible assets in the future or that such impairments will not be material.

Although we maintain internal monitoring systems, we may be unable to detect or prevent all unsafe working conditions, environmental damage, fraud, bribery, corruption or other crimes involving our employees, directors, representative agents or third parties acting on our behalf. We may, therefore, be subject to civil, administrative and criminal penalties and to reputational damage. The involvement or association of our directors, employees or agents with fraud, bribery or corruption and other crimes committed in relation to our activities, or allegations or rumors relating thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Italian corporate entities (and foreign-based corporate entities operating in the Italian territory) may be subject to administrative liability pursuant to 231 Decree in case certain specific crimes are committed in their interest or to their advantage by individuals who have a functional relationship with said corporate entities, such as employees, directors and representatives. Crimes which could cause a corporate entity’s administrative liability pursuant to 231 Decree include, inter alia, those committed when dealing with public administrations (including corruption, bribery, misappropriation of public contributions and fraud to the detriment of the state), corporate crimes, environmental crimes (including environmental pollution (inquinamento ambientale) and environmental disaster (disastro ambientale)), money laundering and self-money laundering (autoriciclaggio), crimes of manslaughter or serious injury in violation of provisions on health and safety at the workplace, and tax crimes. The implementation of Organizational, management and control models (“OMCs”) under 231 Decree along with the appointment of a supervisory body (Organismo di Vigilanza) entrusted with their monitoring, however, provide the foregoing corporate entities with a defense from the administrative liability set forth by 231 Decree. If a crime falling within the scope of 231 Decree is committed by individuals who have a functional relationship with such corporate entities in their interest or to their advantage, the court will examine the OMC implemented by the relevant company and, only if it is considered to be inadequate, ineffectively implemented or insufficiently monitored by the supervisory body, the relevant company could be subject to fines, confiscation of the proceeds of the crime and—if specifically provided for such crime—disqualification sanctions which include: (i) debarment from exercising business; (ii) suspension from, or revocation of, current or future authorizations, licenses, grants which were instrumental to the commission of the crime; (iii) prohibition from contracting with public authorities; (iv) exclusion from subsidies, loans contributions or, where applicable, the revocation of those already granted; and (v) prohibition on publicizing goods or services. The duration of these disqualifications sanctions usually ranges from a minimum of three months to a maximum of two years (in very serious cases, however, some of these disqualifications sanctions can be applied permanently). Moreover, under Italian law any Office of the Public Prosecutor is subject to a constitutional duty to initiate criminal investigations as soon as it becomes aware that a crime might have been committed. This implies that, regardless of the apparent merits of a case, if an individual having a functional relationship with an Italian corporate entity (or a foreign-based corporate entity operating in Italy) is deemed to have committed a crime falling within the scope of 231 Decree in its interest or to its advantage, both that individual and the relevant subsidiary will face criminal investigations. Furthermore, pending these criminal investigations, if serious evidence is gathered by the Office of the Public Prosecutor to sustain that the corporate entity is liable in connection with a crime and there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it might relapse into the wrongdoing, a criminal judge may order the application of any of the aforementioned sanctions as interim measures. Polynt S.p.A. and Reichhold S.r.l. have both implemented an OMC; as previously noted, however, the adoption of such compliance system does not in itself preclude the application of sanctions under 231 Decree in case a crime falling within the scope of 231 Decree is committed by individuals who have a functional relationship with such corporate entities in their interest or to their advantage and their OMCs are considered to be inadequate, ineffectively implemented or insufficiently monitored by their supervisory bodies. ----- If, therefore, Polynt S.p.A. and Reichhold S.r.l. (or any of our non-Italian entities operating in Italy) are found liable under 231 Decree and disqualifications sanctions are imposed in connection with a specific crime, their authorizations, licenses, concessions and financing agreements may be terminated (or our ability to draw under financing agreements may be suspended) and they may face temporary or permanent suspension of the operations, debarment from contracting with public authorities and debarment or cross-debarment from public funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any proceeding relating to alleged crimes falling within the scope of 231 Decree, even if it ultimately discharges the relevant entity, could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business. Any such proceedings may also cause adverse publicity and reputational harm and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, following a workplace injury occurred in 2017 on Polynt’s S.p.A.’s premises, a criminal proceeding for alleged culpable injuries was initiated against two managers of the Group, which resulted in a first-instance acquittal. Such acquittal is still subject to a potential appeal by the relevant Public Prosecutor Office and the allegedly culpable events that were the subject of this proceeding may still lead to a 231 Decree proceeding against Polynt S.p.A. itself, pursuant to applicable Italian legislation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Tax laws or the interpretation or application of tax laws could change in a way that is unfavorable to us.,"Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions. Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, including assessments of future earnings which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of our business, there are various transactions and calculations, including intercompany transactions and cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. We are regularly audited by tax authorities who may disagree with our tax estimates or judgments. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any such tax audits could differ from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, we are and may in the future become involved in proceedings with national or regional tax authorities. While we attempt to assess in advance the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these proceedings or claims, it is difficult to predict final outcomes with any degree of certainty. The levels of taxation to which our operations are subject could increase in the future. Any such future increases in the levels of taxation, or the implementation of any new taxes to which our operations will be subject, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject to intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds among our Group pursuant to, for example, loan agreements, licensing agreements or other arrangements. In addition, given that our headquarters are located in Italy, certain members of our group are subject to Italian tax law, whose compliance and administration is generally a complex process that often requires taxpayers to make subjective determinations in relation to their application. For example, we currently have a pending claim with the Italian Tax Authority, resulting out of an audit for the 2014, 2015 2016 and 2017 fiscal years with respect to Polynt S.p.A. for certain additional tax payments allegedly due. The Group has allocated €6.2 million as provision for such matter as of June 30, 2021. Adverse developments in tax laws or regulations (including future Italian legislation, judicial or administrative changes or interpretations with respect to tax laws to which our business is subject) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the relevant authorities may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax and social security treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, including the Notes, existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction of interest expenses. We may also fail to comply with tax laws inadvertently or through reasons beyond our control. If any of these circumstances were to occur, it could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial amounts of tax, interest and penalties, which could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In such cases, it may be necessary to defend our tax filings in court, if a reasonable settlement cannot be reached with the relevant tax authorities, and any ensuing litigation could be costly and distract management from the other affairs of our business. Tax audits and investigations by the ----- competent tax authorities may generate negative publicity which could harm our brand and reputation with sponsors and commercial partners.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Our large group of companies may give rise to inefficiencies.,"Our multi-subsidiary corporate structure, spanning across a number of different jurisdictions, is susceptible to administrative inefficiencies and, in certain jurisdictions, regulatory restrictions for moving cash within the group and we do not have a Group-wide cash pooling arrangement in place. In addition, some of our subsidiaries are in jurisdictions which are subject to significant restrictions on the flow of capital abroad, including exchange control, limitations on shareholder loans and capital controls (for example, China or India), which may restrict our ability to use cash from parts of our operations to support others. For example, we may require an extended period of time to liquidate the relevant entity under applicable law before being able to repatriate the total compensation due by the Chinese local government for the Changzhou Site’s Closure and Relocation, accordingly, as of June 30, 2021, we had CNY 86 million (approximately €11.2 million) of restricted cash held in China. The operation of our business through multiple subsidiaries results in certain administrative expense that we would not incur if all of our operations were conducted within a leaner structure. Expenses arise from more complex record keeping and internal procedures for allocating various operating expenses, among our subsidiaries, and in the preparation of our financial statements. Until we are able to eliminate or combine certain subsidiaries, these companies will add to our cost structure and these costs may place us at a competitive disadvantage to groups that are more efficiently organized than we are.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be insufficient to prevent others from developing similar products to ours. Despite our efforts, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States or the European Union. Furthermore, any pending patent application filed by us may not result in an issued patent, or if such patents are issued to us, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. The expiration of a patent or the failure of our patents to protect our formulations, processes, technology or proprietary knowhow could result in intense competition, with consequent erosion of profit margins. In addition, our competitors and any other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully manufacture and market our products in a competitive manner, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. 23 of our patents are expected to expire within the next two years, including those related to low VOC low tack gel coat resins, and low VOC vinyl ester resin and applications. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change, the confidentiality of patent applications before their publication (typically 18 months from filing) and/or uncertainty in predicting the outcome of proceedings relating to the ownership or the scope of protection of patents relating to certain technologies, competitors may be unexpectedly issued patents that we do not anticipate. Similar patents issued by competitors could reduce the value of our product pipeline or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which we have unknowingly relied, require us to seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology and we cannot ensure that we would be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or at all. We also rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation, along with other trade secrets, to develop and maintain our competitive position. Third parties (including our competitors) may develop such knowledge or technology independently without violating our trade secret rights. While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property: (i) our confidentiality agreements may be breached; (ii) such agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how; or (iii) adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these trade secrets and know-how. ----- Insufficient protection of intellectual property may limit our ability to make use of technological advantages or result in a reduction of future profits. This may cause competitive restrictions and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, according to EU Directive 2016/943/UE on trade secrets, the failure to adopt adequate security measures to protect confidential information may weaken trade secrets protection recognized by law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Given our international operations, we have a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuers and to service the intra-group loans will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law, including applicable tax laws or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuers’ subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuers to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes, which will be subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective See “Limitations on Validity and Enforcement of the Guarantees and _Security Interests and Certain Insolvenccy Law Considerations.”_ Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities within the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuers’ subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers will generally be limited to the amount of distributable earnings/reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. The subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

Finally, our ability to deduct interest expense would be more limited which will, in turn, reduce the amount of cash available to service the interest on our debt, incuding the Notes.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuers’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the secured parties may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate may include restrictions on the persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuers’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we (or other members of the Group) issue additional Notes under the Indenture or other indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, holders of such Notes or other indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

An enforcement over such shares on a first-priority basis for the secured parties would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In addition, such subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future in compliance with the Indenture. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over any such subsidiary’s shares may result in the release of its debt obligations. Such release is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge.

In this regard, a longer period might apply to any collateral governed by Italian law which be granted after the Offering. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of bankruptcy at below market value (i.e. to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g. payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw back action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any claw back action.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuers’ subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuers, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Guarantee if the relevant company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuers and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and _other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; ----- - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

In addition, the abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Floating Rate Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” (or refinancing thereof) in respect of Polynt S.p.A.

Should the Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral granted by Polynt S.p.A., be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral, as well as any other contract entered into in connection therewith, could be declared null and void. The Notes Documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Notes Guarantee and/or Collateral and/or indemnities granted by Polynt S.p.A., would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code applicable to Polynt S.p.A., this latter will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the relevant Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral shall not be in force and effect ab initio. In any case, the maximum amount that Polynt S.p.A., may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by Polynt S.p.A. will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by by Polynt S.p.A. to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor under the Notes and/or pursuant to the SSRCF Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by Polynt S.p.A., the obligations of Polynt S.p.A. as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the SSRCF Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the limit of Polynt S.p.A.’s credit support (as applicable) as described above. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed among the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security. See “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. Finally, it is possible that a Guarantor or creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a guarantor of the Notes, may contest the validity and enforceability of the applicable Notes Guarantee on any of the above grounds and the applicable court may determine that the Notes Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor.

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Floating Rate Notes. The European Money Markets Institute (the authority that administers EURIBOR) has undertaken a number of reforms in response to the EU Benchmark Regulation, which was first published in June 2016 and requires only benchmarks published by “authorized administrators” to be used in new financial contracts beginning on January 1, 2022. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating EURIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. Changes in the method of calculating EURIBOR, or the replacement of EURIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to EURIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks. We may need to renegotiate existing indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and changes in the method of calculating EURIBOR, or the use of an alternative rate or benchmark, may negatively impact the terms of such renegotiated indebtedness. If changes are made to the method of calculating EURIBOR or EURIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain contracts and cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. This may result in an increase to our interest expense. Moreover, the loans under our SSRCF Agreement, the ABL Credit Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes bear interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR, EURIBOR and risk free rates such as SONIA and SOFR. To the extent that the interest rates were to increase significantly on such indebtedness, the related interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements such as structured interest rate swaps designed to fix a portion of these interest rates, there can be no assurance that any such current or future hedging arrangements will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of interest rate fluctuations or will not result in losses or that our risk management practices and procedures will operate successfully.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the SSRCF and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the SSRCF. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.

All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security ----- interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and _Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ For a more detailed description of various limitations on the security under Italian law, see “Limitations _on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Italy.”_ In Spain, security interests are construed as ancillary rights to the secured obligation(s); thus, for a security interest to be validly perfected it must be accepted by the creditors of the secured obligations or by a third party duly authorized to act on their behalf, and legal title over a security interest must be held directly by the creditors of such secured obligations or such third party duly authorized to act on their behalf. Therefore, and since the concepts of trustee and security agent are not expressly recognized under Spanish law, there is no assurance that Spanish courts would recognize the acceptance of the security interests in the Collateral by the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the perfection or creation of the security interests in the Collateral. Moreover, the enforcement of the Collateral by the Security Agent may be made conditional to the existence of a power of attorney granted by each of the secured parties in favor of the Security Agent for such purpose and such power of attorney should be duly notarized by a local notary and affixed with an apostille (or be legalized before the Spanish consulate authorities in cases where the country of the secured party is not a party to The Hague Convention). If no such power of attorney is provided or such power of attorney is not valid, the Security Agent may not be able to enforce the Collateral in Spain on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Therefore, there could be a delay in the enforcement of the Collateral in Spain while the Security Agent obtains such powers. In addition, in Spain, it may be the case that for the actual enforcement of the Collateral, each of the secured parties benefiting from such Collateral would have to evidence its title to the secured obligations, ratify such Collateral and accept the benefit of the security interest in their respective names by executing a public deed through duly appointed representatives by means of notarized and apostilled powers of attorney.

Before the Acquisition Closing Date, it is expected that SCIL II will transfer its rights and obligations under the SPA to the Parent pursuant to a novation agreement to be entered into among SCIL, The Parent and SCIL II. Completion of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including antitrust and foreign investment approvals (which have all been obtained), as well as the performance of certain closing actions. We currently expect completion of the Acquisition to take place in the fourth quarter of 2021. If completion does not take place by January 31, 2022 (or if extended, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by the Parent, March 31, 2022), the SPA may be terminated by either party. See “Use of Proceeds” for the estimated sources and uses required for the Acquisition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions”. The Parent shall have the right to extend the longstop date to no later than March 14, 2022, subject to procuring that the financing commitment in the commitment letters, delivered in connection with the Acquisition, is extended to maintain certainty of funding on the same terms and conditions. See “Use of Proceeds” for the estimated sources and uses required for the Acquisition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions”. The SPA contains customary title and capacity warranties, but does not contain business warranties, given that Black Diamond is an existing investor in the Group. The SPA also includes customary signing to completion covenants given by SCIL for the conduct of the business between signing and completion. The consideration payable by the Parent to SCIL under the SPA is €2,209,940,717 (assuming the Acquisition Closing Date would have occurred on June 30, 2021). The actual consideration payable at the Acquisition Closing Date may vary, depending on the actual timing of the Acquisition Closing Date as a result of a ticking fee and possible deductions due to any known leakages. 45.59% of the consideration will be paid in cash, with the remainder being paid through the issuance of a convertible loan note. It is expected that on the Acquisition Closing Date, the obligations under the convertible loan note will be transferred to the Parent’s indirect shareholder, SCIL II (Topco) Limited (“SCIL II Holdco”) and that SCIL will convert the loan note in exchange for the issuance of such number of shares in SCIL II Holdco as would give SCIL ownership of not less than 99% of the shares in SCIL II Holdco and BD III and and BD IV will contribute their shares in SCIL II Holdco to SCIL, thereby giving SCIL ownership of 100% of the shares in SCIL II Holdco. In addition, on the Acquisition Closing Date SCIL will reduce its capital by cancelling all of the shares in SCIL held by GCS and distribute the cash proceeds received under the SPA to GCS by way of a special dividend, expressly provided for under SCIL’s articles of association.

Our business began in the mid 1950s and through a series of acquisitions and corporate reorganizations we have grown into one of the leading global composites and coatings technology producer in the world, with extensive footprint and reach. We divide our products into three classes: Composites, Specialties and Intermediates. Each class comprises several individual products which, in turn, have multiple applications for various industries. In addition, many of our products, particularly our Intermediates, rather than being sold straight to end-users, are used internally in the production of other, higher-margin products in different classes. We sell our products to over 5,000 customers worldwide. Over the years, we have built many strong and stable relationships with our customers, many of whom we have been supplying for over 20 years, primarily through our experienced, international internal sales staff who market our products in over 100 countries. We operate 36 production and distribution facilities and 13 R&D laboratories, spanning across Europe, the Americas and Asia.

For example, global GDP in 2020 was significantly affected by Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, a sharp decline in economic activity in China in January and February was followed by similar downturns in the rest of the world from March onward. Global GDP declined by 3.5% in 2020. Euro Area GDP contracted by 7.2% (2019: +1.3%). Some countries were particularly impacted: GDP fell by 9.0% in France, 9.2% in Italy, 11.1% in Spain and 10.0% in the United Kingdom. Overall, U.S. GDP fell by 3.4% (2019: +2.2%). China was the only major global economy to report growth in 2020, of 2.3% (2019: +6.0%). In India, by contrast, GDP fell by 8.0% after a lockdown lasting several months (2019: +4.2%). Although global economic activity is currently growing again, it is not forecasted to return to business as usual in the near term. We were impacted by the GDP trends in the first half of 2020. However, following the decline in economic activity in the first half of 2020, our economic performance improved in the final quarter of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. Although our sales declined in 2020, with 983,966 tons compared to 1,050,093 tons in 2019, our Adjusted EBITDA in the period September to December 2020 increased compared to the same period in 2019, and our revenue, GVA and Average Unit Margin increased to approximately €611.1 million, €208.8 million and €583 per ton, respectively, compared to €626.3 million, €186.2 million and €568 per ton, respectively, in the same periods, respectively. Moreover, despite the ongoing economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, our results of operations in the first half of 2021 recovered to pre-pandemic levels, despite sales volumes still remaining below 2019 levels. For example, while sales for the period ended June 30, 2021 were 534,152 tons, compared to 464,782 tons and 548,119 tons in the same periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Profit for the period and Adjusted EBITDA in the period ended June 30, 2021 increased to approximately €108.8 million and €199.3 million, respectively, compared to €26.2 million and €119.2 million, respectively, and 34.5 million and €128.2 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Similarly, revenue, GVA and Average Unit Margin in the period ended June 30, 2021 increased to €1,143.2 million,[4] €369.4 million and €692 per ton, respectively, compared to € 861.0 million, €279.9 million and €602 per ton, respectively, and €1,078.5 million, €301.0 million and €549 per ton, respectively, in the same periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These results were achieved mainly due to an increase in demand for our products coupled with a market-wide decrease in supply, as a result of shortages of raw materials, logistics issues affecting the market, and competitors’ factory closures. Combined with increased customer liquidity, these trends resulted in an increase in prices for our products and therefore an increase in our margins. Our products are used in several industries, including building and construction, transportation, automotive, electrical, food and feed, marine and home appliances. Most of these industries, particularly the building and construction sectors, have exhibited cyclical demand over the historical periods presented. We believe this cyclicality, which is a function of general economic conditions, has affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The _chemicals industry is subject cyclicality, seasonality and volatility.”_ Political factors also impact the demand for our products and given the various geographical regions we serve, these could impact our operating results. Demand in Europe and North America in recent years has also been driven by customers switching to higher quality products and advances in manufacturing that has resulted in the replacement of traditional building materials with flexible and recyclable Composites and other synthetic materials. Demand in developing regions such as Malaysia and South America has been driven by increased population growth, a growing middle class, a focus on industrialization investment and higher 4 This based on management accounts and excludes approximately € 5.3 million of income realized from March 2021 through the sales of the remaining stock on hand of Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) co. ltd., whose production was discontinued in February 2021 following the mandatory closure request received from the Chinese Government. ----- infrastructure spending. Our results of operations reflect these trends where we have seen an increase in demand for Specialty chemical products being used in building and construction projects in developing regions. The competitive landscape and macro and micro economic impacts (i.e industry expansion, plant shutdowns, scheduled maintenance, force majeure actions and others) also influence the market supply and our operating results.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.2,Fluctuations in the Prices of Raw Materials,"Raw material costs comprise the largest portion of our operating costs. The majority of the raw materials we use are based on crude oil, including butane, orthoxylene, benzene, styrene and pseudocumene. The prices we pay for such raw materials are closely linked to the price of crude oil and crude oil price fluctuations have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and our financial condition. Other raw material costs include the cost of soybean oil and normal butane used in the production of certain coating crude oil prices. We, like other specialty chemical producers, typically seek to mitigate the risks of fluctuating commodity prices by having contracts both with suppliers and customers that allow for price renegotiation on a monthly or quarterly basis or that provide for automatic price adjustment based on the average price of the commodity according to different price indices. The remainder of our volumes bought and sold are done so using either spot contracts at the then-prevailing market prices or otherwise based on formulas reflecting quotes in industry newsletters and other pricing benchmarks which in turn reflect the most recent changes in raw material costs at the time of sale. We also attempt to align the price negotiation periods between our customer contracts and the relevant supplier contracts where possible. Passing through increases or decreases in raw material costs to our customers (either through price renegotiation or automatic price adjustments), while seeking to maximize our margins without commodity hedging, causes our revenues to fluctuate in close relation to raw material prices (assuming constant sales volumes). We are not always able to pass through raw material price increases, or in some instances we experience a certain time lag and, therefore, experience lower margins. Conversely, in 2020 and the first half of 2021 we were able to effectively pass through increases in raw material costs, thus reducing the negative impact derived by the increases in raw material costs. Our inability to quickly pass through all raw material cost increases might be affected by several additional factors. For example, demand in the end applications where our customers compete can sometimes be too weak to absorb the full effect of price increases. As a result, we sometimes postpone passing on cost increases in an attempt to maintain sales volumes, which can adversely affect margins. Changes in raw material prices also have a direct impact on our working capital levels. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials leads to an increase in our working capital requirements, as our inventories and trade receivables increase as a result of higher raw materials prices, which increase is only partially offset by an increase in trade payables. Due to the quantity and turnover of the raw materials that we typically keep in stock, this increase typically occurs gradually over a period of three months. Conversely, decreases in the cost of raw materials typically lead to a decrease in our working capital requirements within the same three-month period following a decrease in costs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The raw materials we use in our _production operations are derived from crude oil and other petroleum feedstocks, which are subject to supply shortages and price volatility”._",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

For example, phthalic and maleic anhydrides, which we produce for captive use, represent approximately 40% of the total raw materials cost of producing UPRs. We estimate that vertical integration increased our total margins for 2020 by approximately €12.0 million, calculated on the basis of the profits made by external suppliers for our captive products and assuming that all GVA is retained by the Group. Furthermore, we benefit from the optimization of production in our plants as a result of the captive use of Intermediates. The vertically integrated nature of our business together with our proprietary catalyst technology used to produce our higher-margin products gives us significant operational autonomy from the volatile and less ----- profitable Intermediates market, while providing increased visibility on market trends, a greater independence in timing price adjustments and an ability to respond quickly to changes in customer demand and, therefore, has a significant effect on our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Within our product classes, we offer thousands of product formulations, which comprise a broad and varied product portfolio allowing us to meet the needs of customers in a wide array of end applications. Composites are tailored to a number of specific applications more than Intermediates, so the Composites focus of our product offering, mitigates our exposure to the volatile Intermediates market and allows us to meet the needs of more customers in a wide range of industries from the transportation and construction to the food and feed industries. We believe our geographic diversification creates multiple advantages, as it allows us to have facilities in close proximity to both our supplier and customer bases. This proximity is a particular advantage as most of our key products can typically only travel to up to 2 thousand kilometres and have a 1-month shelf life, enabling us to meet client needs on a timely basis while minimizing logistics cost of transporting our raw materials and finished products. Our geographic diversification also acts as a natural hedge against localized economic downturns and allows us to maximize operating leverage and boost margins by increasing output volume in regions that experience increasing demand.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.5,Exchange Rate Fluctuations,"We operate internationally and, as a result, are exposed to various currency risks and exposures. Although our reporting currency is Euro, a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in currencies other than Euro, predominantly the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and six months ended June 30, 2021, 36% and 40%, respectively, of our revenue was Euro-denominated, 37% and 34%, respectively, was U.S. dollar-denominated or U.S. dollar-linked with the remainder denominated in other currencies. The primary effects of exchange rates on our results of operations may be described in terms of translation and transaction exposure. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our operations require the use of _several different currencies, exposing us to both transaction and translation effects of exchange rate fluctuations”. Translation Risk_ Translation risk is the risk that the value of our net sales, costs, assets and liabilities reported in Euro on our consolidated income statement and balance sheet will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. For instance, strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar will result in a decrease in our net sales, costs, assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars but reported in Euro. As many of our subsidiaries operate in markets that use currencies other than the Euro, these effects may be significant. Management estimates that in 2020 an increase or decrease to U.S. dollar exposure of 10% would impact profit or loss and equity by ----- approximately €2.1 million and €2.6 million, respectively. Translation from each company’s reporting currency into Euro does not expose us to any cash flow risk and thus this exposure is not hedged. _Transaction Risk_ As a result of our global customer and operations base, our Group companies occasionally enter into contracts expressed in currencies different from their operating currencies. Because these contracts are often settled and/or executed over a certain period of time, we are exposed to the risk that the relative exchange rate will fluctuate unfavorably between execution and full performance of the contracts. Although we engage in some currency hedging to mitigate the effects of currency transaction risk, the strength of our geographic diversification generally allows us to make use of natural hedges within our foreign currency denominated operations, including through matching the currency of our sales to the currency of the purchases of raw materials and other production costs. The revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our Group companies results in either financial income or financial expense on our income statement for the relevant period. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Group had financial income from exchange rate gains of €9.0 million and €9.4 million, respectively and financial expense on exchange rate losses of €31.6 million and €4.3 million, respectively, mainly related to the exchange rate effect on outstanding loans denominated in USD and intercompany loans for some of the subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, on-going capital expenditures to ensure compliance with current and future HSE laws and regulations. Carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions are by-products of our production processes, and as a result we are regulated by the EU Emissions Trading System in the EU and the EPA in the United States. National or regional legislation and regulations may impose additional restrictions on us in the future in relation to our carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions, which could lead to increased costs or capital expenditures or require additional operational changes at our production facilities. The main regulations relating to safety of substances and chemicals affecting our industry are REACH in the European Union, which imposes significant obligations on the chemicals industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of basic chemicals and semi-specialty chemical products, and the Toxic Control Substance Control Act in the United States. Complying with these obligations is expensive and time consuming and leads to increased production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. In addition, from time to time, we incur remediation costs at our current facilities and decommissioning costs associated with closing production facilities. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 we had provisions of €23.0 million and €22.4 million, respectively, for anticipated ecological remediation costs that may be necessary at certain facilities.

Moreover, certain of our facilities have minimum capacities below which they cannot be efficiently operated. Our utilization rate is influenced by factors such as industry consolidation, regulation, product substitution, unplanned downtime for our and our competitors’ facilities, industry cycles and customer demand. ----- We aim to operate our facilities at full capacity, while maintaining a balance between optimizing volume output and the pricing of the corresponding chemical products produced at the relevant facilities. We regularly review and analyze utilization rates and product mix across our portfolio with the aim to optimize utilization rates depending on demand. We attempt to minimize the need for facility downtime and maximize the useful life of our production facilities by undertaking regular maintenance closures to perform necessary inspections and testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry out any necessary maintenance activities. We aim to schedule these closures during seasonal periods of reduced demand and in coordination with our raw material suppliers’ planned shutdowns. For example, we schedule maintenance closures of most of our European production facilities during August and December of each year to correspond with generally reduced demand during those periods. When possible, we seek to limit the effect of scheduled outages on our results by increasing inventory ahead of planned turnarounds and by coordinating with our customers to manage expectations in terms of product availability and logistical changes such as changes in the location from which we will ship our chemical products. Typically, before a major shutdown, we either sell less of our chemical products or enter into swap contracts with other chemical producers and inform customers we are doing so in order to increase our stored inventory in an effort to ensure we have adequate chemical products available.

We remain competitive with our low fixed-cost base: for the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed costs represented 21.8% of our total costs (compared to 18.5% in 2019). In addition, our vertically integrated production model has the effect of reducing costs, particularly transportation and raw material costs.

We define GVA as total revenue from all products less variable costs (including raw material, energy and distribution costs). The Group’s GVA depends therefore on our ability to manage variable costs and to pass increases through to customers, thereby increasing revenue and maintaining profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our GVA grew to €584,524 per ton, compared to €540,995 per ton in in 2018, mainly due to strong profitability in the Composites market. Similarly, strong profitability for both Composites and ----- Intermediates in the second half of 2020 and first half of 2021 led to a GVA of €674,539 per ton for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in GVA per ton in these periods was driven by a successful pricing strategy, focus on innovations, products being a low portion of customer’s manufacturing costs, combined with high level of service and technical support. Increased sales volume typically results in increased sales revenue, but also increased costs including costs of raw materials to produce the volume sold and increased cost of services due to increased transports costs. During 2020 and the first half of 2021, there has been an increase in market demand for our products coupled with a market-wide decrease in supply, as a result of shortages of raw materials, logistics issues affecting the market, and some competitors’ factory closures, while the Group was able to serve its customers without disruption, resulting in sales volumes recovering strongly in the first half of 2021 and increasing compared to the first half of 2020. Combined with increased customer liquidity, these trends resulted in an increase in prices for our products and therefore an increase in our margins. We define Average Unit Margin as GVA divided by the total volume of products sold to third parties and measured as € per ton.

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard (i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases). The Group applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in retained earnings of January 1, 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for the year ended December 31,2018 was not restated. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognized additional right-of-use assets and additional lease liabilities. The initial adjustment on financial liabilities as of January 1, 2019 was €16,5 million, while the final effect on financial liabilities as of December 31, 2019 was €12,2 million. As a result, our 2019 results were decreased by €106,000.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The Intermediates business was also impacted negatively in 2019 by the duties imposed by the US on China, as more volumes from competitors flooded into Europe as they were disincentivized from selling into the US.

Changes in raw material prices have a direct effect on our operating working capital levels. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials lead to an increase in our operating working capital requirements, as our inventories and trade receivables increase as a result of raw materials prices and related sales levels, partially offset by an increase in trade payables. Due to the quantity of raw materials that we typically keep in stock, this increase occurs gradually over a period of three months. Conversely, decreases in the cost of raw materials lead to a decrease in our operating working capital requirements within a typically three-month period following the decrease in costs. Our operating working capital levels vary as a result of several other factors as well, including the effect of selling prices, production stoppages and maintenance works, changes in payment terms in the case of key suppliers, foreign exchange rates, our decisions to hold inventories, the operating level of our business, seasonality and cyclicality of the industries that we supply. The decrease in operating working capital of €44.5 million from €306.7 million as of December 31, 2019 to €262.2 million as of December 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower inventory levels.

Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied. The Group generates revenue primarily from the sale of organic anhydrides, composite, coatings and their derivatives to its customers. Revenue recognition generally occurs at the point of time when performance obligations are fulfilled and control transfers to the customer. No significant judgements are applied. In most instances, control transfer upon transfer of risk of loss and title to the customer, which occurs when we ship products to the customer from our manufacturing facilities or when the products are received by the customer on the basis of the shipment and condition clause. Customer incentives are generally based on volumes purchased and recognized over the period earned. Sales, value added, and other taxes that we collect concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from the transaction price as they represent amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

This recoverable amount equals the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units or “CGUs” or “CGU”. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The value in use of the CGU to which the asset belongs is determined when the value in use of an individual asset cannot be estimated. The value in use of a given asset is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, before taxes, by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money and of the assets’ specific risk. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss if the recoverable amount determined is less than the asset’s carrying amount for that cash generating unit (CGU). The impairment of a CGU is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the other assets of the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impaired asset is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment no longer applies or when there has been a change in the measurements used to determine the recoverable amount, except for those related to goodwill and property, plant and equipment with finite lives which are never reversed. The reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization) if the impairment had not been recognized. The reversal is recognized immediately in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

In the case of internally produced inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. In the case of finished goods, this value corresponds to the estimated sales price in normal business conditions, net of the estimated costs to complete the sale. The net realizable value for raw materials, supplies and consumables is represented by the weighted average replacement cost. The purchase cost includes ancillary costs; the production cost includes directly attributable costs and a portion of indirect costs, reasonably chargeable to the products. Work in progress is measured on the basis of the actual average cost for the period, based on the percentage of completion. Obsolete or slow-moving inventories are written down in relation to their presumed future possibility of use or realizable value, through the inclusion of a specific provision for the write-down of inventories.

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Deferred tax is recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for: - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group and the reversal of temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance provided to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such valuation allowance is reversed when the probability that such unrecognized deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable profit or other management actions. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

All derivatives are initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost that represents their fair value. Any directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. All derivatives are subsequently measured at fair value. The changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss in the case of derivatives which are not hedging instruments. Hedging derivatives are classified as follows: - fair value hedges, if they hedge the risk of changes in the market value of the underlying asset or liability; and - cash flow hedges, if they hedge the risk of cash flow changes generated by existing assets and liabilities or by a future transaction. Both the changes in the fair value of fair value hedge derivatives and the fair value changes in the underlying item are recognized in profit or loss. In the case of cash flow hedges of, for example, the risks related to non-current floating rate loans, changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income statement for the part which highly effective way risk to which they were put in place, while recorded in profit or loss any part that proves ineffective. The part attributed to other components of comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss when the assets and liabilities hedged impacts the costs and revenue of the period.

A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of the past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. _Long-term employee benefits_ Post-employment benefits are considered a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes restructuring costs. If the benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within one year of the reporting date, then they are discounted. The benefits guaranteed to employees in the form of the employee severance indemnity are paid when the employment relationship is terminated and are recognized over the period in which the right vests. The liability for benefits to be paid at the end of the employment relationship is determined based on actuarial assumptions and is recognized on an accrual’s basis consistent with the service necessary to obtain the benefits; the obligation is determined by independent actuaries. Gains and losses arising from the actuarial calculation are recognized in other components of profit/loss of comprehensive income. Actuarial losses arising on the calculation of the present value of the liability to pay the benefits are recognized in the financial expenses. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss under personnel expense. ----- _Share-based payment arrangements_ The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the sharebased payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of stock appreciation rights (SARs), which are settled in cash, is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value of the SARs. Any changes in the liability are recognized in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Commodity price risk principally relates to movements in the prices of the raw materials we purchase to make our products. In particular, our raw material prices depend on exchange rates and the price development of crude oil and virgin naphtha. The risk is managed and optimized by both the centralized procurement management function and our policy of using different suppliers all over the world for each type of raw material. We generally acquire raw materials and sell finished products at posted or market-related prices, which are typically set on a quarterly, monthly or more frequent basis in line with industry practice. We seek to minimize reductions in our margins by passing through raw material cost increases to our customers through higher prices for our products. In addition, we manage the timing of our price increases to coincide as closely as possible to increases in the prices of the underlying raw materials. In order to better manage these fluctuations in raw material prices, we increasingly set our prices on a monthly basis.

It mainly relates to our trade receivables and financial investments. - Trade Receivables and Other Receivables Our exposure to credit risk principally depends on our customers’ individual characteristics. The demographical variables of our customer base, including the sector and country risk, do not have a significant impact on our credit risk. We have a specific internal credit management procedure whereby each new customer’s credit standing is analyzed before any credit facilities are granted. These analyses include third party appraisals, when available. Credit facilities are agreed for each customer and they may only be exceeded after the approval of the relevant internal bodies depending on the customers’exposure. The credit facilities are checked annually and customers that do not meet our credit standing criteria may only make purchases against advance or guaranteed payment. The Group has worked with the majority of its customers for more than four years and the non-collection of receivables is infrequent. Credit risk monitoring procedures are based on grouping customers by credit characteristics, geographical location, sector, ageing, due date and the existence of previous financial difficulties. The Group’s trade and other receivables are generally from industrial production companies. The Group has an allowance for impairment, which reflects estimated losses on trade and other loans and receivables and non-current financial assets. It mainly comprises individual impairment losses on significant exposures and collective impairment losses on groups of similar assets on which losses of unknown amounts have already been incurred. The Covid-19 pandemic spread did not impact the Credit Risk of the Group. - Guarantees (guarantees not recognized in the statement of financial position) All borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement are guaranteed by certain Holding Companies, the Issuers of EUR TLB and USD TLB, the Borrowers under the RCF and the respective Holding Companies and are secured by the equity of those Subsidiaries. A Guarantor Coverage Test will have to be satisfied on an annual basis. ----- - Credit Risk Exposure The carrying amount of financial assets is our maximum exposure to credit risk. Based on previous experience, we have impaired significant trade receivables on an individual basis, when there were indications of objective partial or total non-collection risks.

We estimate that an increase or decrease of 1% in U.S. dollar currency exposure would affect the profit and loss and equity by approximately EUR 1 million.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.1,,"We are a global specialty chemical group headquartered in Italy. One of the leading global composites and coatings technology producers in the world, with unparalleled footprint and reach. We divide our products into three classes: Composites, Specialties and Intermediates. Each class comprises several individual products which, in turn, have multiple applications for various end applications. In addition, many of our products, particularly our Intermediates, rather than being sold straight to end-users, are used internally in the production of other, higher-margin products in different classes. We sell our products to over 5,000 customers worldwide, with whom we have built strong and stable relationships over the years, primarily through our experienced, international internal sales staff who market our products in over 100 countries. We have longstanding relationships with our customers, many of whom we have been supplying for over 20 years. We operate 36 production and distribution facilities and 13 R&D laboratories, spanning across Europe, the Americas and Asia.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Our Products,18.2.1,Composites,"Composites include resins and compound products and represent our largest class of products accounting for 79.8% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our resins include UPRs, vinylester and coating resins (such as gelcoat, alkyd and epoxy resins), while our compounds are principally categorized as SMCs and BMCs. See “Business—Our Products—Composites.” Composites display unique characteristics like light-weight, rigidity, resistant to chemicals, good electrical insulation properties, temperature resistance and durability that keep maintenance costs low compared to substitute legacy materials such as steel, aluminum, titanium, concrete and steel. Composites are batch-produced and are characterized by the large number of different formulations that can be used for a wide variety of end applications with different requirements, resulting in highly customized products. We have approximately 1,200 different formulations for UPRs, and approximately 500 for each of gelcoats and compounds. The geographical distinction of the production network plays a crucial role for composites producers, who are faced with a need to balance the benefits of economies of scale from a smaller number of sites (as incremental capacity additions in a site are less capital intensive than setting up a new facility) with the necessity to have production sites that are close to customers. Customer proximity is particularly relevant for UPRs as they have a short shelf life (approximately 1 month) which makes it difficult for them to travel far from their production site. We operate 36 production and distribution facilities spanning across Europe, the Americas and Asia. We hold leading positions across our composites class of products including UPRs and Compounds. We are also a leading producer of alkyd coating resins in North America. ----- The global composites sector was estimated to be worth approximately €12.1 billion in 2020, with the UPR, compounds and coating resins sectors comprising approximately €7.9 billion, €3.2 billion and €1.1 billion, respectively. We believe that for the period 2019−2024 the Composites segment will grow at an annual rate of 3.6%. The chart below shows the estimated annual growth for each product group: Global growth % p.a. by product group 2019−2024 3.7% 3-4% 3-4% 3.1% 3.2% UPR BMC/SMC Gelcoat Alkyd Epoxy Note: Excluding impact of Covid-19 pandemic Source: Company estimates based on market knowledge and third party industry information On a regional basis, Asia is expected to experience the highest growth in the composites sector, in particular in China where we believe a 4.5% p.a. growth is expected in the period 2019−2024. For the same period, we believe that the US market will grow at an annual rate of 3.2%. In Europe we believe that Composites will grow at a rate of 2.2% p.a. for the period 2019-2024, though opportunities for higher growth exist in Central and Eastern Europe. Growth in Composites is driven by several trends including the increasing need for light-weighting components and the use of UPR composites to replace legacy materials such as steel, the increasing need for renewable energy and wind turbines as well as the continued shift from solvent-borne to water-borne coatings due to VOCs emission in coatings. Composites demand is also driven by the growth in the underlying end applications where Composites are used such as infrastructure and construction, mobility, wind energy and house appliances. We believe that our growth rate by volume in specific segments in the Composites segment (in particular, wind, piping and artificial stone) has outpaced overall growth in the relevant end applications, mainly as a result of our focus on niche applications and specific substitution trends. In particular, in the period 2017−2020, EU market sales in the wind and artificial stone markets grew annually by 3% and 2% CAGR, respectively, while our sales grew annually by 21% and 6% CAGR in those end applications, respectively, and while EU market sales in the piping market decreased by 5% in the same period, we grew annually by 6% in that end applications. UPRs UPRs are our core products and are the most important polymer for the production of composites, mainly glass fiber-reinforced plastics. UPRs may be used in a wide variety of applications, as they are capable of being tailored to meet customers’ needs and thanks to the exceptional characteristics of the material, such as lightness, rigidity, strength. The products in this class are generally made to meet specific performance requirements such as heat-resistance, durability, processability, viscosity and other resistance requirements. UPRs are used, among others, in construction (tub- and shower units, cured-in-place pipes, synthetic marble), transportation (truck panels and sheets) and wind applications (turbine blades, nacelle), which are end applications that have demonstrated strong and resilient growth dynamics fuelled by macroeconomic trends in recent years. We expect these growth dynamics to remain going forward. Demand from the construction market is set to benefit from the substantial government spending on infrastructure in our key markets as well as the secular trend towards higher urbanization in emerging markets such as India. UPRs demand is expected to continue benefitting from the ongoing replacement of legacy materials such as steel and aluminium in applications requiring superior weight saving characteristics such as transportation, where fuel efficiency and emission savings are of paramount importance. Shift to renewable energy sources continues to drive demand for wind turbines where our UPRs products are increasingly used. The UPRs industry has experienced significant change in landscape, with significant benefits for players that are still active in the space. See “Business—History.” With respect to UPRs, we retain leading positions across both continents, with approximately 30% share in the US and approximately 40% share in Europe. We differentiate ourselves from our competition by having a vertically-integrated business model, utilizing our in-house production capabilities, and strong positions in attractive segments such as wind energy, with innovative products and high customer loyalty. Our proprietary technology enables forward integration into gelcoats and compounds. |Col1|Col2|3.1%| |---|---|---| ----- UPR industry evolution Source: Company estimates based on market knowledge and third party industry information UPRs capacity in Europe and America, as result of this evolution remained largely flat and marginally declined since 2005, accompanied by a reduction in total number of active players. This trends has led to an improvement in utilization rates in our plants and for the broader sector. Vinylester, Gelcoat and Coating Resins Vinylester and other coating resins are produced with a similar production process as that used for UPRs. Vinylester resins are resins produced by the esterification of an epoxy resin with acrylic or methacrylic acids. The end applications for vinylester include the construction (bath tubs, fencing manholes), marine (boat hulls and parts), piping and toy sectors. Growth driven by continued shift from solvent-borne to water borne coatings, as well as growth in demand from outdoor applications in the architectural segment (e.g. wood floors for decks and roof coatings). Gelcoat is a high-quality resin finish applied in a liquid state to the visible surface of a fiber-reinforced composite material mold to provide a glossy finish. The end applications for gelcoat include (i) marine (they are used in the exterior coating of boats and yatchs due to resistance properties), (ii) building and construction (such as building panels and façade appearance), (iii) transportation (such as exterior layer for buses, cars, trucks, trains and aircrafts), and (iv) others, such cosmetic nails and polishes. The individual composition of the gelcoat varies depending on the final intended application. Future growth in demand is anticipated to be driven by construction end applications (ranging from tub and shower to industrial linings) as well as marine applications, where it is used in boat coatings. Alkyds are made of a polybasic acid or anhydride, polyhydric alcohols and/or monobasic acids, mainly derived from natural oils. A variety of other resins and monomers can be used to modify the alkyd product, allowing for customization to meet specific performance requirements of customers. Alkyd resins are a major class of paints and coatings that are used in architectural applications, product finishes but can also be adapted to suit specific applications in other sectors. In many market segments alkyd technology offers a value proposition unmatched by other coating technologies, which addresses trends towards sustainability. Going forward, growth is expected to be driven by applications with strict performance requirements such as product finishes and special purpose coating segments. We are a leading Alkyd coating resins producer with 61% market share in the US. ----- Share % US overview based on capacity — Alkyd coating resins Source: Company estimates based on market knowledge and third party industry information _Compounds_ SMC and BMC are high volume thermoset composite materials made out of UPRs or vinylesters and reinforced with glass or carbon fiber. As is the case for UPRs, compounds can be used in a wide variety of applications thanks to the possibility of combining raw materials to vary the final product properties, thereby offering the opportunity to tailor such product to suit end applications needs (e.g. by altering its mechanical, chemical or electrical properties). The end applications for compounds include the transportation, electrical and construction sectors. We are a leading compounds producer with 32% market share in Europe.

Specialties accounted for 16.9% of our revenues in 2020. Specialties are produced in batches and can have a large number of formulations that are customized to specific customers or for specific end uses. Key products within Specialties business includes General and Special Purpose Plasticizers and Speciality Additives. We are a leading global producer of Specialties. The plasticizers segment worldwide was estimated to be worth approximately €12.4 billion in 2020, with the GPPs and the SPPs segment representing approximately €9.6 billion and €1.8 billion, respectively. We believe that for the period 2019−2024 the SPPs segment will grow at an annual rate of 4.6%, compared to an annual rate of 2.6% in the GPPs segment. Growth driven by demand from automotive applications and non-cyclical applications such as wiring, cable and medical devices.

End users for plasticizers include the construction (outdoor constructions such as swimming pool linings, roofing membranes), electrical, appliances (liquid-contact medical devices) and consumer goods (food packaging), and transportation (automotive cable and wire insulation) and industrial end applications (high-exposure machine parts). In the plasticizers business, the Group focuses on SPPs, which benefit from ongoing substitution dynamics compared to GPPs, due to environmental and toxicity concerns relating to GPPs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, SPPs accounted for 7% of the Group’s revenue, compared to 2% for GPPs. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, SPPs accounted for 6% of our revenue, compared to 2% of our revenue for GPPs. GPPs are commodity products, applied in basic end uses such as flooring and cable sheathing, while SPPs are based on more specialized chemistries and are tailored to meet performance requirements, such as resistance to high temperatures, low fogging and volatility. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin is the most important customer segment for plasticizer use, accounting for approximately 90% of plasticizers globally. Specialty Additives The specialty additives segment includes a collection of smaller scale, attractive products that are used in polymer resin curing, agrochemical and pharmaceutical intermediates, food additives and other uses such as varnish resins, foundry solvents, biodiesel additives, cosmetic lubricant additives and in cigarette manufacturing. Specialty anhydrides are mainly used for curing epoxy resins to create products with superior longevity and high mechanical, thermal and electrical resistance for usage in highly demanding end applications such as wind blades or large electrical transformers. Specialty esters are utilized in a wide variety of end uses, such as humectants in food and feed, intermediates in the production of active ingredients in pharma and cosmetic lubricant additives.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Intermediates accounted for 4% of our sales in 2020. Intermediates are mature products with no environmental or regulatory concerns which lack viable alternatives, meaning there is little substitution risk. See “Business—Our Products—Intermediates.” We are a leading producer of Maleic anhydride and Phthalic anhydride in Europe. As majority of our intermediate capacity is consumed internally, we anticipate future growth to be largely driven by developments |2.7% 2.2%|Col2|2-4%| |---|---|---| ----- and captive use in our downstream applications. Strategic opportunities for growth in these business segments are expected, particularly in Asia, where the market is very fragmented and includes a large number of players, and in North America, where backwards integration would help the Group secure supply as is the case in Europe. The intermediates market was estimated to be worth approximately €6.4 billion in 2020, with the Maleic anhydride, Phthalic anhydride and Trimellitic anhydride sectors representing approximately €2.5 billion, €3.7 billion and €270 million, respectively. We believe that for the period 2019−2024 Intermediates will grow at an annual rate of 2.2%.

Trade of Maleic anhydride remains regional, due to the high transportation costs as the product needs to remain heated during transport. Phthalic anhydride is a major industrial chemical used in the production of plasticizer and synthetic resins (e.g. UPR and alkyds), as well as for dyes and pharmaceuticals. Trimellitic anhydride is a key raw material for the production of SPP, which accounts for the largest proportion of its end uses, and is also used in the production of insulation enamels and powder coatings. The Trimellitic anhydride market is smaller than that for Maleic anhydride and Phthalic anhydride by volume, and there are six producers of Trimellitic anhydride globally.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

We believe, based on our market knowledge and third party sources that, the construction industry will grow at an annual rate of 2.1% in the Americas, 2.9% in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 5.2% in Asia for the periods 2022−2025, without taking into account disruptions and recovery in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, government spending has encouraged large infrastructure projects, while environmental concerns will continue to stimulate the development of more environmentally-friendly solutions. The growth in the construction industry is expected to lead to an increased demand in products in our end applications, such as sanitary resins, gelcoats and artificial marble used in households, as well as pipes and metal surface coatings used in infrastructure products. _Transportation_ An increase in the use of public transportation in densely populated cities and regions, together with new railway infrastructure products in Asia and the Middle East is expected to continue to increase the demand for passenger wagons. Furthermore, rising logistic demands, led by macroeconomic developments and the growth of e-commerce, are expected to continue to drive the demand for trucks. We believe, based on our market knowledge and third party sources that, the transportation industry will grow at an annual rate of 3.8% in the Americas, 5.3% in EMEA and 6.2% in Asia for the periods 2022−2025, without taking into account disruptions and recovery in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. The growth in the transportation industry is expected to lead to an increased demand in UPRs, for use in commercial vehicles and railways, as well as resins and gelcoats used in commercial vehicles and public transportation. ----- _Marine_ Growing wealth pools have led to an increasing number of potential buyers for yachts, especially in the Middle East and Asia, together with an increased demand for experiential luxury supported by new technologies making yachts easier to use. We believe, based on our market knowledge and third party sources that, the marine industry will grow at an annual rate of 2.0% in the Americas, 4.2% in EMEA and 5.8% in Asia for the periods 2022 – 2025, without taking into account disruptions and recovery in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. Increased demands for yachts is expected to have a positive impact on the market for materials used in their production, such as UPRs and gelcoats used in the construction of yacht hulls. _Wind Power_ A global movement towards sustainability is expected to continue the transition towards wind energy and other renewables, with technology advancements enabling competitiveness against alternative renewables. Furthermore, there are additional opportunities for installing wind turbines outside of established regions, for example in Russia, Oman, Kazakhstan and South-East Asia. We believe, based on our market knowledge and third party sources that, the wind power industry will grow at an annual rate of 5.4% in the Americas, 6.3% in EMEA and 8.8% in Asia for the periods 2022 – 2025, without taking into account disruptions and recovery in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand for UPRs used in the production of wind blades and nacelle is proportional to the installed capacity of wind turbines, which is expected to continue growing. In addition UPR benefits from being more flexible and cheaper than alternative materials for the production of wind turbines, such as epoxy resins. _House Appliances_ Emerging markets remain the key growth drivers in this segment accounting for more than 60% of the middle-class population in 2020. Further, the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase of consumer purchases, in part due to a shift in working patterns and an increase in remote working. In 2020, approximately 11% of our revenue was derived from products used in this segment. We believe, based on our market knowledge and third party sources that, the house appliances segment will grow at an annual rate of approximately 2.6% in the Americas, approximately 2.3% in EMEA, and approximately 6.0% in Asia for the periods 2022–2025, without taking into account disruptions and recovery in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. _Electrical_ The sudden increase in remote working, home schooling and global digitalization, mainly caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased demand for products in the data center and telecom infrastructure segments. We expect future growth also in the medical devices market. In 2020 approximately 10% of our revenue was derived from products used in the electrical market.

In the 1960s we were acquired by Alusuisse S.A., a large Swiss multinational which, in the 1970s consolidated our activities with newly-acquired chemical company Lonza AG. Throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s we developed dibasic acids and their derivatives, in particular special polymers. We also produced certain new derivatives, including those derived from phthalic anhydride, such as fumaric acid, and those derived from maleic anhydride such as esters and special anhydrides. Beginning in the mid-1970s, demand for our products began to increase as a result of a rapid expansion of the polymer industry largely due to increased demand in the Italian construction and transportation sectors. To take advantage of the growing market, we undertook a number of bolt-on acquisitions of complementary businesses and production facilities in order to increase our production capacity. Initially, expansion occurred primarily through acquisitions of production facilities throughout Italy that produced UPRs, plasticizers made from phthalic anhydride and the phthalic anhydride used to produce the plasticizers. In the late 1980s, and again in the early 1990s, we expanded our product offerings by acquiring Italian businesses that produced compounds reinforced with UPRs. In the mid-1990s we constructed a new plant in Ravenna, Italy to bring production of the chemical intermediate, maleic anhydride, in-house. During the 2000s, after the spin-off of Lonza AG from the chemical division of Alusuisse S.A., we continued our international expansion by acquiring facilities in Germany, Poland and the UK, pursuing mergers and acquisitions with certain ex-Lonza companies, the purchase of the Chemial group and the acquisition of the anhydride business of a leading Chinese producer. We also expanded production capacities at a number of our already-existing and recently-acquired facilities with an aim toward both increasing output 5 This based on management accounts and excludes approximately € 5.3 million of income realized from March 2021 through the sales of the remaining stock on hand of Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) co. ltd., whose production was discontinued in February 2021 following the mandatory closure request received from the Chinese Government. ----- and diversifying our production in an attempt to efficiently maximize our production capacity. We also built a number of co-generation plants to supply our facilities with the electrical energy used in our production processes. In 2006, we completed a successful IPO on the Italian stock market, and in 2008 following a takeover bid, Polynt was taken over by Polimeri Speciali S.p.A., indirectly controlled by Investindustrial, a leading European private equity funds. In the same year, Polynt was delisted from the Milan Stock Exchange after its shares rose by 104%, compared to the initial price quotation. Since the entry of Investindustrial, we have continued the expansion becoming a European Leader in Specialty and Composites, by acquiring, in 2011 and 2014, PCCR, the composites and resins business of Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc. and CCP, the composites business of the Total Group, respectively. The acquisitions of PCCR and CCP significantly increased our presence in the composites sector, especially in the production of UPRs and gelcoat, and expanded our geographic footprint in North America, South America, Asia and Australia. In 2017, we combined with Reichhold, owned by Black Diamond, to form a global group in the Intermediates, Composites and Specialties sectors. Reichhold was founded in 1927 and expanded its business through organic growth and acquisitions, completing an IPO one the New York Stock Exchange in 1955 and being named a Fortune 500 Company in 1985. Reichhold became part of Dainippon Ink and Chemicals in 1987, until a management buyout of the Reichhold business in 2005. Black Diamond acquired Reichhold in 2015. Following the combination, our management worked to maximize the synergies of the combined Group and to streamline the enlarged Group’s operations, to grow its market share, production volumes and profitability. Since the combination we have rationalized our manufacturing capacity and improved our product portfolio, optmizing our value-based pricing with a focus on innovation and our vertically integrated services model. his combination enhanced the Group’s leading position as a global vertically integrated specialty chemicals player, with significant global presence in Europe, North America and Asia, reinforcing our successful integration of PCCR and CCP with Reichhold’s global scale, extensive product portfolio and R&D competencies.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

We have expanded our footprint and capabilities and contributed to such consolidation by acquiring PCCR, the composites and resins business of Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc., and CCP, the composites business of the Total Group, in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and, more recently, by combining with Reichhold in 2017, as a result of which our market share in UPRs (representing capacity by producer) increased from 8% and 7% in Europe and America, respectively, in 2011 to 40% and 30%, respectively, based on 2019 data. ----- Traditionally, the Composite industry has pursued a volumes based approach to sales, which often contributed to a mismatch between offer and demand. In recent years, partly as a result of greater focus on value-added products (which carry greater margins), we have experienced a realignment between supply and demand. Competition within the industry remains strong, both on a global scale, among industry leaders, and in specific areas due to the presence of several, well established, regional manufacturers. A key measure of our profitability is GVA/ton. We have increased our GVA/ton profile through a continuous evolution of our portfolio towards higher-margin specialty applications and an improvement in the industry landscape. Our contractual framework both with suppliers and customers allows for price renegotiation on a monthly or quarterly basis or provides for automatic price adjustment based on the average price of the relevant commodity according to various price indices, which allows us to largely pass through volatility in raw materials, limiting the impact of raw material price movements on margins. The table below shows the increase in the GVA/ton profile of the Group from 2018. Source: Management data _Customer focused and innovation driven business model consisting of strong formulation know-how and development initiatives with customers_ Over the past decade, we have evolved from a local producer of Intermediates to a global composite specialty producer. Our strong focus on innovation has driven the transformation of our portfolio, with 79.8% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 being attributable to Composites, from 43% in 2008. The Group is supported by its approximately 100-person technical sales team, which focuses on local customer requirements and specifications, tying in with the Group’s strong focus on direct sales to customers, which represented approximately 90% of the Group’s sales volume in the first six months of 2021. Moreover, the Group provides high quality, bespoke formulations and delivers products with identical specifications out of our different facilities to meet the needs of global customers which require consistency across their various locations. Our strong formulation know-how gained over the years has allowed the Group ----- to innovate in application development, delivering over 1,000 SKUs, and we estimate that approximately 15-20% of our product portfolio is renewed each year. The chart below shows the percentage of the Group's turnover from Composites new products by year of introduction for EMEA: Source: Management data Our business is innovation-driven, with R&D centers strategically located across our worldwide operations. We focus our R&D efforts on anticipating market developments and meeting our customers’ ever evolving needs. Our R&D activities are fully integrated into our business model thereby reducing time to market for new products and enhancements and improving our ability to respond promptly to customer demand, as well as reducing costs and risks relating to new products and increasing environmental safety, all of which have a positive input on margins. We have developed regulatory expertise in highly regulated markets such as the EU and the US, with approximately 350 specialists working in our Research centers, Development labs, Quality Control labs and Technical support teams worldwide. Our R&D centers collaborate closely with our customers to identify, develop and market innovative products that meet our customers’ evolving requirements and competitive challenges. In some instances, we collaborate with clients to go through regulatory approval processes and/or we undergo internal vetting and approval processes. One of the key factors to our success is our ability to provide high quality, bespoke formulations with identical specifications for global customers on a local basis. We have a strong formulation know-how, with a portfolio of over 2,200 formulations, developed over the years, which has allowed us to innovate in application development, delivering over 1,000+ SKUs in 2020. Recent successful innovations include a new formulation for engineering stone to obtain outstanding glossing and scratch resistant kitchen slabs, and new vinyl ester resins for carbon fiber reinforced spar caps for wind blades. The below chart shows a selection of our strategic R&D projects with successful end use applications. ----- We also collaborate with highly specialized universities for specific projects, such as the Universities of Bologna, Munich, the University of Ferrara, and the Politecnico of Milan. In 2020, our research and development expenses were €18.6 million. See “Business—Our Operations—Research and Development.” _Diversified customer base_ We have a diversified customer base that includes large multinational companies, with our top 10 customers representing 30.2% of our revenue for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2021, and our largest customer accounting for 8% of our revenue in the same period. Our customer relationships are based on our experience in offering bespoke technological solutions and ongoing local support. In 2020, our top 10 customers by revenue had been customers for more than 20 years on average. Our customer base is diversified across product categories, with our top ten customers by revenue operating across different industries, including distribution, wind energy, paint and coatings, artificial stone and cables and wires. The below table shows out top ten customers by revenue for the period ended June 30, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Approximately 90% of our sales volumes are conducted directly by our internal sales force. Composites are often borne out of significant collective efforts with customers to develop the optimal product for their end and use applications. The customized solutions we provide vary depending on the characteristics and chemical composition of the end and use applications, logistical needs (for example, ease of transport and shelf-life) and specific regulatory requirements. Providing high-quality products with specificity, sensitivity and consistency, coupled with extensive product validation data are key to fostering customer retention. In addition, the quality and dependability of our products are sometimes critical to obtaining commercialization and marketing approval from regulatory agencies. _Global footprint allowing proximity to our customers base_ Marketing and distribution of UPRs is a complex process due to their limited shelf life (approximately 1 month) and the limited range available for transportation from the relevant production sites (approximately up to 2,000 km). Our manufacturing footprint is strategically located to ensure access to key logistic routes and manufacturing clusters. As a result, our global footprint and proximity to our clients is a key competitive strength as it allows us to service a larger number of clients in different geographies, with lower logistical costs and shorter lead times to provide just-in-time service. With 36 production sites and distribution facilities worldwide, we are typically close to our customers. This proximity to our customers, together with our highly experienced and well trained sales and support staff enables us to efficiently deliver our products to over 5,000 customers across more than 100 countries. Our geographical reach and penetration enables us to respond rapidly and effectively to our customers’ demands, and is a key factor in our ability to develop and maintain customer relationships. _Diverse product portfolio enables us to focus on attractive market niches, benefitting from strong organic growth trends in end industries_ Our diverse portfolio of products enables us to focus on a number of highly attractive and diverse end applications, most of which offer significant structural growth potential. The variety of end uses for our products enables us to mitigate the impact on our business of cyclicality or seasonality that some of these markets from time-to-time experience. ----- As a result of our diverse product portfolio, we are well positioned and equipped to take advantage of new trends in customer demand that may develop, naturally or in response to macro events such as the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced growing demand for our products that are used in professional hygiene, home and personal care and wood protection market end uses both in the US and Europe, as customers have placed greater focus on health protection and well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is a trend we believe will continue as a “new normal”. In addition, we have recorded greater demand for light weight products in the mobility sector as well as a greater demand for Composites, as opposed to traditional metals, in the wind energy market. Some of our products, such as resins and coatings, are subject to seasonal demand as they are used in market segments that have higher demand during spring and summer (e.g., paints for home maintenance and marine coatings). This seasonality helps us manage our volumes over the course of the year to maintain relatively stable production. We divide our diverse product portfolio into three classes: Composites, Specialties and Intermediates. These product classes expose us to a broad range of attractive customer market niches, which have benefitted from positive macroeconomic and societal trends (such as, population growth benefitting the infrastructure and construction industries, and the increased focus on sustainability benefitting the wind energy industry). See “Industry—Key Outlook for our End Applications” The below chart shows the application of our product portfolio in a selection of customers’ end applications. _Integrated platform with stable profitability_ Our production process is based on a vertically-integrated model, which allows us to leverage the in-house production and consumption of Intermediates (e.g. phthalic and maleic anhydrides), which tend to have more volatile prices, in the downstream production of higher-margin Composites and Specialties. In 2020, phthalic and maleic anhydrides, which we produce for captive use, represented 25% of the total raw materials cost of producing UPRs. Therefore, we benefit from low volatility in terms of input cost and supply, and we are capable of delivering to our customers a greater level of availability of our products and certainty in delivery. Further, having access to vertically integrated intermediate and low-cost inputs supports our margins and helps us capture a greater share of profit across the value chain, especially in Europe where we have experienced demand for Intermediates outpacing the offer establishing a trend, which we believe, is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. The vertically integrated nature of our business, together with our proprietary catalyst technology used to produce our higher-margin products gives us significant operational autonomy from the volatile raw material prices, in particular in the Intermediates market. This reduces our dependency on suppliers while ----- providing greater flexibility in timing price adjustments, as it allows us to foresee trends in advance, and an ability to respond quickly to changes in customer demand and test effectiveness of our products in-house. The Group is better able to predict trends in Intermediates pricing, as it purchases their main petrochemical raw materials. This allows the Group to be proactive in its price adjustment decisions compared to non-vertically integrated producers. Our proprietary catalyst technology has been developed through the years, allowing the Group to develop a leading technology for the oxidation catalysts for the production of maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and trimellitic anhydride, which can be used in conjunction with any of the processes currently used worldwide for the production of those molecules. Moreover, we license our technology to third parties, for example for the production of maleic anhydride from butane with fluid bed reactors, where the catalyst is a main part of its production. Our proprietary catalyst technology and know-how is currently used only by two other producers worldwide, which are not our end product competitors. _Strong free cash flow from customer base and maintenance capex-light business model_ We have achieved resilient performance over the years with strong and stable cash flow generation. During the last three years, we have increased our profit for the period and Adjusted EBITDA Margin from 34.8 million and 10.2% in 2018, respectively, and € 107.4 million and 11.8% in 2019, respectively, to €43.2 million and 15.0% in 2020, respectively. We have generated significant cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow over the last three years, and in particular €115 million and €162 million, €169 million and €215 million, and €222 million and €255 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Our business model, including our focus on directing our portfolio towards higher growth and higher margin products, has proven its resilience with strong performance in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. During 2020 and the first half of 2021, there has been an increase in market demand for our products coupled with a market-wide decrease in supply, as a result of shortages of raw materials, logistics issues affecting the market, and competitors’factory closures. Combined with increased customer liquidity, these trends resulted in an increase in prices for our products which was greater than the increase in raw material prices. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue and Average Unit Margin were €2,028 million[6] and €640 per ton, compared to €1,746 million and €595 per ton, respectively and €2,043 million and €557 per ton, respectively, for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Further, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 our profit for the period and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were €125.8 million and 16.8%, compared to €43.2 million and 12.7%, respectively, and €107.4 million and 11.8%, respectively, for the period ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our robust margins are attributable to our vertical integration, our leadership position across the value chain, our strong relationships with our customers. Our contractual framework both with suppliers and customers allows for price renegotiation on a monthly or quarterly basis or provides for automatic price adjustment based on the average price of the commodity according to various price indices, which allows us to largely pass through volatility in raw materials, limiting the impact of raw material price movements on margins. We also strive to maintain stability through industry cycles by developing and maintaining relationships with customers that are industry leaders and relatively less vulnerable to economic downturns because of their financial strength and therefore maintain a stable demand for our products. Furthermore, we have a maintenance capital expenditure light operational structure, as our production processes rely on small scale reactors that operate at moderate temperatures and use batch production methods and, as a result, require limited maintenance and repair baseload capital expenditure. We also benefit from the cost advantages of operating large-scale, integrated facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customers locations. The combined result of our strong cash flow generation and asset light model has been that over time we consistently managed to achieve reductions in our net levels of indebtedness. In the period 2018-2020, we have incurred Total Capital Expenditure of €48.8 million, €50.2 million and €50.1 million per year, respectively, to maintain and enhance our facilities’ efficiency, representing 2-3% of our annual revenue in the same period, and we estimate capital expenditure of approximately €50 million per year in the coming years. We believe that this structure allows us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates and helps us maintain positive margins and solid cash flows even during industry downturns or periods of decreased customer demand. 6 This based on management accounts and excludes approximately € 5.3 million of income realized from March 2021 through the sales of the remaining stock on hand of Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) co. ltd., whose production was discontinued in February 2021 following the mandatory closure request received from the Chinese Government. ----- _Highly experienced management team, leading talented workforce_ Through acquisitions and organic growth, we have developed from a small regional European producer of Intermediates into a diversified global player in Composites, Intermediates and Specialties, with revenue of €1,745.8 million in 2020. Through this growth, we have established a strong know-how in the sectors in which we operate, particularly in understanding the profile of our customers and the dynamics of our business which has enabled us to sustain this global growth. This growth has been led, and enabled, by a team of highly qualified members of our senior management team that combined have over 45 years of experience in our industry. Our Chief Executive Officer, Rosario Valido joined Alusuisse (at the time a Group company) in 1982 and since then has held various management positions. Paolo Carugati joined the Group in 2006 as Chief Financial Officer, and had previously held other finance roles, including being CFO of another multinational group from 2000. Sergio Mario Conni joined the Group in 2009 following the acquisition of Chemial Group. Since then, Sergio has covered various operations and business management positions in the Group. From 2014 to 2017 Sergio covered the position of Senior Vice President Americas, reporting to the CEO. He then moved back to Italy and served as EVP Europe, until taking over as Group COO in July 2020. Our senior management team is supported by a lean and efficient organizational structure that relies on talent, expertise and passion to help us create value. We invest in the training and wellbeing of our work-force as a means to improve performance and foster retention, which in turn are key factors in our efforts to further our growth and future development. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we invested €613.4 thousand on welfare projects in Italy. We also benefit from the expertise and experience of Black Diamond Capital Management LLC (“Black",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,"Diamond”), which has significant expertise and a successful track record in the chemicals market, both in",18.8.1,,"Europe and the U.S. Black Diamond acquired Reichhold in 2015, and has controlled, together with Investindustrial, the Polynt Group since 2017. In addition to its interest in the Polynt Group, Black Diamond currently controls TFL Ledertechnik GmbH (“TFL”), a Europe-focused, global specialty chemicals player with a focus on specialty chemicals for the leather industry, and, together with Investindustrial, Bakelite Synthetics, a European and US specialty chemicals player carved out from Hexion’s phenolic specialty business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Our Strategy,18.9.1,,"Our principal objectives are to continue operating as a global supplier of Composites, Intermediates, and Specialties and to increase the value of the business by generating strong, sustainable and growing cash flows across industry cycles. To achieve these objectives we focus on five main pillars: _Leverage positive underlying industry dynamics_ Our markets are growing, with strong pull-through demand from our customer base and attractive end industries dynamics. We plan to continue to focus on such highly attractive applications that offer significant and enduring growth potential with an aim to expand our operations. In Composites, we intend to take full advantage of recent trends in some of our key end-markets. These include increasing demand for light-weight UPRs in the transportation segment as well as increasing demand for the Composites used for wind turbines due to growing demand for wind turbines driven by the continuing shift to renewables. At the same time, we plan to exploit increasing demand for coating resins in the building market driven by the growing outdoor application sector, and increase our presence in the water-borne coatings segment as many emerging economies continue to switch from solvent-borne to water-borne coatings. In Specialties, we intend to further exploit the significant grow of plasticizers demand we recently recorded due to the increased use of plasticizers in the automotive markets, as well as the increased demand from non-cyclical applications such as wiring, cable and medical devices. We are focusing on developing sustainable solutions via special purposes plasticizers that are phthalate-free. Furthermore, we plan to continue benefitting from the increased use of malic acid and other specialties in multiple food and cosmetics applications. Our Specialties are widely used in high end applications and sectors, like cosmetics, food and feed, pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrancies, health care, and other luxury items. Most of these sectors are not cyclical and management expects to leverage on the Group’s breadth of experience and wide product portfolio to capture market growth. In Intermediates we intend to continue to benefit from our vertical integration to use our Intermediates and use our access to Intermediates production to manufacture higher margin products. ----- _Pursue initiatives to grow and create value_ We pursue high-return organic initiatives to grow and create value with selected projects. We seek growth through improvements of our product portfolio, in particular with respect to Specialties, and value-added downstream products, as well as by targeting new geographies. In Asia for example, we aim to increase UPR margins by expanding the production of UPRs and Gelcoat in China. In Eastern-Europe, we believe we can capture demand growth through capacity expansion of UPRs and Gelcoat in Poland. Through our plant in Spain, we hope to target the electrical and automotive markets in Europe. In the U.S., we intend to expand the range of products in our facilities to include Specialty Anhydrides, Specialty Plasticizers and Compounds to support growth of our global clients operating in the Americas and to strengthen our footprint in high value-add products. We are also aiming to improve our production flexibility across Europe, United Kingdom, and North Africa and to upgrade vinyl ester production technologies to serve clients in the growing wind energy markets. We are also pursuing other efficiency initiatives to target, among others, Intermediates with a view to improving operational efficiency, by seeking to achieve better selectivity and energy efficiency by carefully modifying the catalyst chemistry. For example, our new fluidized bed catalyst generation is intended to increase yield with a reduction in CO2 production per ton of maleic anhydride, as well as new phthalic anhydride reactor with additional capacity and reduced CO2 production. We will also continue to consider potential bolt-on acquisitions with focus on carefully selected assets. _Continue innovation to deliver successful new applications_ Our R&D operations are key to maintaining our innovation and ability to respond to market developments and customer needs, and are a core component of our customer offering. Our innovation projects are driven by market demand and customer needs for applications that meet evolving customer needs. This innovation is a key driver of revenue growth. We focus on continually improving our product offering through the introduction of tailor-made solutions and development of new applications to drive higher margins. Co-development initiatives are the predominant channel for developing new products that are demanded by customers for their new products, creating strong customer relationships and customer loyalty. Our main R&D objectives are to: (i) develop new formulations and cutting-edge technologies, such as environmentally friendly vapor-free coatings, (ii) lower the environmental impact of our production, (iii) improve process efficiency and productivity of MA, PA, and TMA, via proprietary catalyst technology, and by decreasing cost of production, and (iv) introduce new and better performing products aligned with segment needs. We intend to use, protect and further develop our intellectual property and unpatented proprietary knowhow by identifying the best practices and the most efficient technologies. We believe that technology innovation can help us achieve a sustainable cost position. We seek to optimize the overall effectiveness of our asset base by making appropriate investments in maintenance, turnaround times and capital equipment in conjunction with personnel training and site and plant benchmarking. _Grow an environmental and sustainability platform by focusing on sustainable products and manufacturing with a positive ESG market_ Our strategies and objectives are underpinned by a commitment to sustainability and ESG (environment, social and governance) values. We aim to operate and develop our business in a way that takes into account relevant economic, as well as environmental and social and governance factors. We also believe sustainability is a lever for growth and will enable us to tap into new and emerging business opportunities. To support this, we have recently appointed an ESG manager, who is responsible for internal auditing of ESG compliance. The below chart shows select ESG metrics for the year ended December 31, 2019. ----- For example, in order to reduce the environmental impact of Composites, we continue to identify new processes aimed at the recovery of chemicals in end-of-life Composites with the objective to re-use materials in polymer synthesis and to reduce the end-of-life environmental impact of Composites, and to improve their carbon footprint by favoring their use for multiple applications. We have a wide product portfolio and technology for recycled composites, such as recycling in cement production operations (full industrial examples available) and chemical recycling (under pilot scale development). For example, R-PET from bottles and other products is used to produce a type of UPR that is then used in piping and composite concrete material for buildings and infrastructures; and recycled carbon fiber from high-end automotive material is reused in producing SMC for transportation industry in structural applications. Moreover, on the R&D side, we are working with other industry partners and stakeholders on technology for chemical recycling of UPR, where the material is broken down into its original chemical components and re-reacted to produce new UPR molecules. In terms of CO2 emission, we continue to pursue a reduction in emissions and energy use optimization, in particular by focusing on the development of higher performing catalysts for maleic anhydride and phthalic anhydride production. We monitor our CO2 emissions globally and have implemented reduction plans in our production facilities with the higher emissions. Moreover, we purchase voluntary CO2 credits, to offset our CO2 emissions that are outside the scope of the EU ETS regulations. Furthermore, we continue to seek to reduce heat loss, increase electrical motor efficiency, improve lighting systems, and optimize natural gas burner systems. For example, some of our recently implemented projects are: (i) the creation of combined power and heat in Scanzorosciate (Italy), and (ii) the optimization of catalyst performance for selective oxidation processes to reduce CO2. Since 2017, we have reduced our CO2 emissions intensity (being emissions volume in proportion to our revenue) by 7.0% p.a. from 332 tons/€million in 2017 to 267 tons/€million in 2020. Although, our emissions intensity increased in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 due to a reduction in our revenue base in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, we continue to pursue a reduction in emissions. Based on an approximate internal calculation carried out by management on an interim basis, we estimate that our CO2 emissions for 2021 will be approximately 233 ton/€million. The following table shows our CO2 emissions intensity for the periods indicated. ----- Our portfolio includes various products with increasing use in renewables, such as UPRs, bonding paste, vinyl ester resins, and gelcoats for wind blades and nacelles. Recent trends for wind blades include the use of larger blades, higher throughput, and improved environmental controls. We are developing a new styrene-free Gelcoat to eliminate emissions of styrene. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize waste generation in our facilities, for example by reusing used/spent solvents both internally and externally. _Deleveraging_ On the Acquisition Closing Date and as a result of the Transactions, our net leverage ratio will be 3.8x. One of our primary goals is to continue to generate cash flow to facilitate deleveraging. Our management is strongly focused on deleveraging the Group’s balance sheet. See “Forward-Looking Statements”. To achieve this goal, we will place significant management emphasis on cash generation and efficient capital spending. Historically, we have been able to generate strong cash flow while meeting the capital requirement of our business, and we believe we are well positioned to generate strong free cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Our Production Model,18.10.1,,"The diagram below illustrates our downstream, vertically-integrated production model by representing how raw materials are transformed into Intermediates through reactions with our proprietary catalysts, and how those Intermediates are the building blocks for the production of our higher-margin Specialties and Composites. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Our Business Lines,18.11.1,,"We divide our business lines into three classes: Composites, Specialties and Intermediates. Each line comprises several individual products which, in turn, have multiple applications for various industries, including building and construction (which accounted for 38% of the revenue in 2020), transportation (which accounted for 13% of the revenue in 2020), house appliances (which accounted for 11% of the revenue in 2020), electrical (which accounted for 10% of the revenue in 2020), marine (which accounted for 5% of the revenue in 2020), wind energy (which accounted for 5% of the revenue in 2020) and other, including food & feed (which accounted for the remaining 18% of the revenue in 2020). In addition, many of our products, particularly our Intermediates, rather than being sold straight to end-users, are used internally in the production of other, higher-margin products in different business lines. We have approximately 5,000 clients, comprising of a few multisite industrial groups, large single-site clients and many small clients operating in a single country. These are all specialized customers for whom we manufacture tailored products (with the exception of pure raw materials). Our facilities are placed in proximity to our customers, enabling us to meet client needs on a timely basis while minimizing logistics cost of transporting our raw materials and finished products.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Composites,18.12.1,,"Composites include resins and compound products. Composites, which are produced in batches, are made from two or more constituent materials with different physical or chemical properties which, when combined, produce a material with characteristics different from the individual components. Innovating to address specific customer needs is key in Composites production as Composites are generally made to meet specific performance requirements such as heat, durability, processability, viscosity and other resistance requirements and can be produced using a large number of formulations and specifications. Indeed, we focus on selected niche applications that provide attractive growth and breadth to our product portfolio and enable faster growth rate compared to growth rate of the relevant industry. The segments were we have focused are, in particular, (i) wind energy, where Composites are applied to long blade turbine and nacelle and for which ----- we have registered an annualized growth rate 21% (compared to a 3% growth rate of the European end market in the 2017-2020 period), (ii) piping, where Composites are used for water and gas transportation, piping for ships, duel and corrosion-resistant pipes and lines and for which we have registered an annualized growth rate of 6% (compared to a negative growth rate of 5% for the European end market in the 2017-2020 period), and (iii) articificial recycled marble stones, for which we have registered a 22% annualized growth rate (compared to a 2% growth rate of the European end market in the 2017-2020 period). Because of this high-degree of customization, our Composites customer base is highly-fragmented. As a result of being high-performance products, Composites typically demand higher prices and thus have higher profit margins as compared to Intermediates. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated €1,619 million in revenue from Composites, representing 80% of our revenue for the same period. _Resins_ Resins comprise UPRs, vinylester and coating resins. UPRs are thermal hardener resins, which solidify rapidly and are structurally stable. Phthalic and maleic anhydrides, which we source from our own internal production, represent 25% of the total raw material cost of UPR production. We also use internally-sourced fumaric acid to produce UPRs. In addition, the production process uses styrene and glycol, which we purchase from our suppliers. UPRs undergo an irreversible chemical transformation during production making them impossible to dissolve or melt. Depending on the end application, UPRs can also be reinforced with fiberglass or other materials for added strength and resistance. We have over 1,200 formulations relating with UPRs. The end industries for UPRs include (i) building and construction (in particular swimming pools, concrete forming pans, gutters and downspouts, cooling towers, corrosion-resistant tanks, pipes, ducts and panels), (ii) furniture (in particular bathroom components and fixtures, such as bathtubs, spas, lavatories, etc), (iii) marine (in particular parts and exterior coatings of yachts and fishing boats), (iv) transportation (such as parts and exterior coatings of trucks, buses, mass-transit vehicles, motor homes RVs and cars), (v) electrical sectors (such as wind turbine applications), and (vi) others (such as synthetic marble, putty, button, electical components). We produce vinylester resins and gelcoat coating resins using a similar production process as that used for UPRs, and make similar use of our internally-produced anhydrides and esters. Vinylester resins are resins produced by the esterification of an epoxy resin with acrylic or methacrylic acids. Vinylester resins are more tolerant of stretching than UPRs making them better able to absorb impact without damage and less likely to show stress cracking. In addition, vinylester resins are more water resistant than UPRs. The end industries for vinylester include the construction (bath tubs, fencing manholes), marine (boat hulls and parts), pipe and toy sectors. Alkyd resins are a major class of paints and coatings, next to others such as epoxies and acrylics. Alkyds are made of a polybasic acid or anhydride, polyhydric alcohols and/or monobasic acids, mainly derived from natural oils. A variety of other resins and monomors can be used to modify the alkyd product, allowing for customization as per performance requirements by customers. Alkyd resin coating systems have relatively low cost, versatility, are easy to use and hence very popular and established with customer. Generally, UPRs and vinylester are highly more attractive compared to other composites materials like steel, aluminium, titanium, concrete or wood. In particular, this is due to the with reduction and the cost competitiveness of these materials when applied to high-end applications. Although, there are limited recyclability possibilities due to a lack of established technology, UPRs and vinylester offer significant recycling opportunities, which would likely be established once there is enough demand in the relevant markets from clients. End industries for coating resins, in particular alkyd are (i) architectural (such as architectural flat to noflat paints and coatings and for outdoors purposes), (ii) product finishes (used to finish products as machinery and equipment, furniture, but also in the automotive and transportation industry), and (iii) others as certain coatings are formulated for specific applications or environmental conditions (such as traffic paints, marine coatings, industrial maintenance or auto refinishing). Gelcoat is a high-quality resin finish applied in a liquid state to the visible surface of a fiber-reinforced composite material mold giving it a glossy finish. Gelcoat is designed to be water and ultraviolet resistant. Gelcoat are resin materials used to provide a high-quality finish on the visible surface of a fiber-reinforced composite. Gelcoat is thermoset resin based reactive coating which creates aesthetically appealing surfaces with enhanced durability, scratch resistance, and improved protection from environmental degradation. Gelcoat comes with an high range of pigmentationa and the possibility to be used in brush and spray applications and are generally applied to molds in a liquid (gel) state. We have over 500 formulations relating to gelcoat. Gelcoats are obtained by mixing the resin and heat it to the first curing stage, leading to the formation of a gel; the individual composition of the gelcoat depends on the final application. The end ----- industries for gelcoat include (i) marine (they are used in the exterior coating of boats and yatchs due to resistance properties), (ii) building and construction (such as building panels and façade appearance), (iii) transportation (such as exterior layer for buses, cars, trucks, trains and aircrafts), and (iv) others, such cosmetic nails and polishes.

Our customers use these compounds in compression molding (for large molded products having relatively simple shapes) or injection molding (for smaller, compact and intricate molded products). During the molding process, due to temperature and pressure, a crosslink reaction takes place, forcing the compound to take and maintain the shape defined by the mold. Our compounds are principally categorized as: - Sheet Molding Compounds (SMCs): SMCs are produced in rolls that are used subsequently for compression molding; or - Bulk Molding Compounds (BMCs): BMCs are produced in bulk and used in both injection and compression molding. Compounds are enjoying increased demand in a market that has become increasingly environmentally conscious because the environmental impact of producing and using compounds is significantly lower than that of more traditional materials such as steel, aluminum and concrete. To capitalize on the increased emphasis on sustainability, we produce Green Compounds which are SMC and BMC composites reinforced with organic, recycled fibers such as hemp, cotton and linen. The “sustainable” content of these composites can reach 60% of the reinforcement material. In addition, we have developed low density SMCs and BMCs, which are used in the automotive sector to reduce vehicle weight and increase fuel efficiency and in the production of solar panels. We have over 500 formulations with respect to Compounds. The end industries for our compounds include the transportation, automotive, electrical, marine, home appliance, building and construction and industrial sectors.

Specialties are produced in batches ----- and can have a large number of formulations that are customized to specific customers or for specific end uses. As a consequence of the high added-value of these products, they typically demand higher prices and generate higher profit margins as compared to Intermediates. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated €329 million in revenue from Specialties, representing 16% of our revenue for the same period. _General and Special Purpose Plasticizers_ General purpose plasticizers (“GPPs”) are organic compounds obtained by the reaction of internallyproduced phthalic anhydride and alcohol which we purchase from suppliers. GPPs are primarily used in the plasticization of polymers such as polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) to make them more flexible and facilitate their workability and distensibility. Our GPPs have applications in many end-uses including coating for electrical cables, synthetic leather, flexible tubing, sports clothes, coating on textiles, automobile undercoating and coating for walls, floors and roofs. The end industries for our GPPs include the electrical, transportation, toy, home, industrial and medical appliance, coating and automotive industries. Special purpose plasticizers (“SPPs”) are produced by exposing internally-produced trimellitic and phthalic anhydride and other raw materials to alcohol in a process known as “esterification”. When added to PVC, SPPs create products that are resistant to high temperatures, remain flexible in low temperatures and resist solvents, oils and ultraviolet light. Our high-performance SPPs allow relatively fast and economic production of PVC used as coating for electrical cables, roof tiles, vinyl leather, dashboards and car interiors. The end industries for our SPPs include the electrical, transportation, medical appliance, building and construction and automotive sectors, as well as cable and wire insulation, and PVC film and sheets.

In certain cases, we then add hydrogen to make the special anhydrides more stable. Special anhydrides are performance chemicals used as hardeners for epoxy resins, in the electrical and electronic industries (including the production of molded circuits, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), transformers, insulators, electrical interrupter switches and high-performance compounds) and in the agro-chemical industry (for the production of fungicides). Specialty anhydrides are used for curing of polymer resins (especially epoxy) where superior longevity and high performance are required, in particular in terms of mechanical, thermal and electrical resistance. We produce specialty esters by exposing maleic anhydride to an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or isobutanol. Specialty esters are used to produce pigments for paints and dyes, as stabilizing additives for plastic materials, in pharmaceuticals, the food industry and in the agro-chemical industry.

These anhydrides are, in turn, used internally in the production of Specialties and Composites, which are sold to our customers. In this sense, catalysts are at the top of our vertically-integrated production model. We have been focusing on research and development projects relating to the oxidation processes since the 1970s and we have 7 There are currently only two other non-composites producers worldwide possessing similar catalysts. ----- improved the oxidation catalysts performance to (i) leverage on the latest technology to produce phthalic, maleic and trimellitic anhydride, as well as being ahead of the curve to develop new product and innovations, respond quickly to customers’ changing demand and test in-house the effectiveness of our products before releasing them in the market, (ii) enhance our business integration, by decreasing the variable costs relating to the production of phthalic, maleic and trimellitic anhydride and benefitting in the production value chain by reducing our dependency on suppliers and enabling operational autonomy, and (iii) decrease the CO2 emissions of our operations. During the past 50 years we have also gained a unique position in terms of know-how and technology advantage in this matter. We perform catalytic oxidation either in fixed-bed reactors (with hydrocarbons such as orthoxylene, benzene and butane) or in fluidized-bed reactors (with butane, using Alma technology). Catalysts produced for fixed-bed reactors have an average useful life of approximately three to four years while catalysts produced for fluidized-bed reactors have an average useful productive life of approximately seven to eight years. In addition to using these catalysts for internal production, we license their use to third parties and occasionally sell certain catalysts in favor of using more productive, new generation catalysts developed by our research and development team.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Intermediates are produced on a continuous basis (i.e., not in batches) and include the anhydrides which we use internally to produce highermargin Composites and Specialties. Intermediates not used internally are sold to third parties for use in their own Specialty and Composite production. We have our own oxidation catalyst technology, which is both used in our own plants and licensed to third parties. Supplying our own Intermediates and selling Intermediates to third parties affords us heightened visibility on the specialty chemicals market, representing a significant competitive advantage. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated €81 million in revenue from Intermediates, after infra-group eliminations, representing 4% of our revenue for the same period. _Maleic Anhydride_ Maleic anhydride is an organic compound that we produce by subjecting either benzene or normal butane (each a petroleum derivative) to the same catalytic oxidation process that produces phthalic anhydride. We developed a proprietary production process called Alma to produce maleic anhydride. Alma uses fluidizedbed reactors and catalysts that we have developed and patented. Fluidized-bed reactors are reactors containing catalysts in the form of a powder, suspended in a stream of reactants. We use Alma in our plants and license the technology to third parties. Maleic anhydride has a wide variety of uses ranging from being a raw material used in producing UPRs to being used as a copolymer for water treatment. We use maleic anhydride internally for the production of nearly all of our Specialties.

R&D is completely integrated into our business model. Core competences for every product line are present in our dedicated R&D laboratories located in our main production sites around the world, with dedicated highly trained employees who work on our performance products and our production technologies using specialised instruments. We also collaborate with universities and certain key customers for customised products or projects of strategic importance. As of December 31, 2020, we employed more than 100 R&D specialists worldwide. We conduct research and development activities at 1 laboratories in our plants in Scanzorosciate (Italy), Brembate (Italy), Parma (Italy), San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy), Drocourt (France), Fredrikstad (Norway), Miehlen (Germany), Stallinghborough (UK), North Kansas City (U.S.), Carpentersville (U.S.), Atlacomulco (Mexico), Mogi das Cruzes (Brazil), Jeonju (South Korea) and Tianjin (China). Our consolidated research expenses were €22.8 million, €21.1 million and €18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Our research and development operations are divided into two main areas: - Product research. We seek to develop new products and improve the performance of existing products, to improve our portfolio in line with market requirements and new trends. Through laboratory trials we are able to synthesize and test our products to ensure they perform as expected. In addition, our laboratory trials are also used to assess potential new uses and applications for our product families. - Technology research. We also work on our production processes to improve the efficiency of our technology and to implement new processes, to ensure that we are always technologically up to date. Our research focuses primarily on addressing specific customer requirements, cost optimization, risk reduction and environmental safety. We often initiate research and development activities both in response to specific requests from individual customers as well as in reaction to the market trends of our product classes. We rely on our research and development teams to stay updated on the relevant market trends affecting their product classes. We also collaborate with highly specialised universities for specific projects. For example, we collaborate with the Universities of Bologna and Munich in research on catalysts, with the University of Ferrara for Composites, with Politecnico of Milan for developing new technologies. Our research has also benefited from grants from the EU, U.S. and other governments, for example in Composites Recycling. The time and resources we devote researching and developing particular products depends on various factors. A significant factor is the degree to which the innovation requested is a departure from products that ----- use existing technology that has already been tested. Products requiring wholly new technologies can often take as long as three to five years to develop, while products that are minimally different from older technologies may be developed in as little as three to 12 months. Research and development activities at our 13 laboratories are characterized as follows: - all 13 of our laboratories are dedicated to specific product classes and use equipment and instruments dedicated to specific product lines, seeking to expand the range of products in each product line based on feedback from our customers; - our Scanzorosciate (Italy) laboratory specializes in research on catalysts for our internal use and for sale to third parties, where we test high-performance catalysts for use in the gaseous phase of the oxidation process by utilizing pilot plants, which are lab-scale model facilities for testing and experimenting on catalysts; and - our laboratories in Scanzorosciate (Italy), San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy), North Kansas City (U.S.) and Drocourt (France) are “pilot plants” that not only research and develop new products, but also test those new products and have the capacity to produce approved products on a semi-industrial scale thus reducing the time-to-market of newly developed products. Our research and development activities are supported, in terms of analytical control, by our analysis laboratories, which are located in each of our main plants. In addition to assisting the research and development process, our plants’ analysis laboratories perform quality control on raw materials and test our finished products. Our product line managers identify the targets, research and controls needed to support their product classes, and are in direct contact with the laboratory that conducts the research and testing for that line. We believe that by conducting our research and development internally and facilitating communication and feedback between the researchers and product line managers, we are able to (i) minimize the time to market of our new products, (ii) reduce our production costs, (iii) be more cost-efficient, (iv) maximize the responsiveness of our research to customer needs and market trends and (v) maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information.

The raw materials we consume most in production are Styrene, Maleic Anhydride and Propylene Glycol. The principal raw materials we use are: - Styrene: Styrene is a raw material used to produce polystyrene, other polymers and, to a lesser extent, UPRs. We use styrene in more than 30 plants. We have renewable annual supply agreements with a number of suppliers of styrene. In Europe our purchase price for styrene is related to the price of benzene (the main raw material for producing styrene) and the published market assessment. We use styrene in four plants in Asia with a total yearly usage of approximately 33 KMt historically. Price and volume requirements are mainly covered by contract, based on Asia ICIS index. In China price and volume requirements are based on monthly spot/market price, as is customary for most chemicals in China. In the Americas our prices are based on formulas linked to key drivers (Benzene, Ethylene and Natural Gas) and spot prices. In 2020, we purchased approximately 93,000 mt of styrene throughout 18 plants across the Americas. - Maleic Anhydride: Maleic Anhydride is a key raw material for UPR. In 2020 we purchased 38,800 mt of maleic anhydride in the Americas throughout our 14 plants. Majority of the supply is secured by long term contracts with price formulas. Maleic Anhydride in Asia is used in all the plants and sourced locally on a spot basis. - Propylene glycols: Propylene glycols are substances derived from propylene. They are used to produce UPRs. ----- We are one of the main consumers of propylene glycols in Europe. We use propylene glycols in 10 of our plants. In 2020 we used more than 39,000 tons of propylene glycols in Europe. We have entered into certain renewable annual supply agreements with our suppliers. The price we pay for propylene glycols is calculated according to a contractual formula providing for price adjustments based on the monthly market price of propylene glycols adjusted in respect of the price fluctuation over the previous month. The price provisions also provide a rebate in case purchases over certain quantities. In the Americas, the price we pay for propylene glycols is calculated according to a contractual formula providing for price adjustments based on propylene publication for Monopropylene Glycol (MPG) and Dipropylene Glycol (DPG). The price provisions also provide a rebate for purchases over certain quantities. In the Americas, Glycols are used in 16 locations. In 2020, we used 28,000 mt of MPG and DPG combined. Propylene Glycols are used in four plants in Asia. MPG is a main raw material for UPR, with a total usage of approximately 61,800 Mt in 2020 globally. We have global and local suppliers and volume requirements are covered by contracts with price based on market price, discussed on a monthly basis. DPG is an important raw material for our UPR, with a total usage in Asia total of approximately 9,500 mt in 2020. We have global and local suppliers and volume requirements are covered by contracts with price based on monthly market price. In China, price and volume requirements for both MPG and DPG are based on monthly spot/market price; as is customary for most chemicals in China. - Pseudocumene: Pseudocumene is an aromatic hydrocarbon derived from petroleum. We use pseudocumene to produce trimellitic anhydride. We use pseudocumene for production in our Scanzorosciate (Italy) plant. We have a sole contractual supplier of pseudocumene with whom the relevant supply agreement expires on May 31, 2025. We have had a very long relationship with this supplier and there are easily available alternative suppliers to which we could switch without incurring very high costs. The price we pay for pseudocumene varies determined by a contractual formula based on the industrial cost of pseudocumene providing for, inter alia, adjustments to inflation and discounts when we purchase increased volumes. In 2020, we purchased approximately 15.7 kton of pseudocumene across our facilities. - Orthoxylene: Orthoxylene is an aromatic product used almost exclusively to produce phthalic anhydride. We use orthoxylene in our Scanzorosciate (Italy) and San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy) plants. Aromatic products are products such as benzene that contain one or more six-carbon rings with double bonds. We have entered into multi-year requirement agreements with our orthoxylene suppliers, in the EU and Asia. We also periodically use spot suppliers in the U.S.. The purchase price we pay for orthoxylene is calculated according to a contractual formula. The key factors in the formula are (i) the fluctuation in the price of crude oil and other petroleum feedstocks on the international market, (ii) the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the euro and (iii) market demand for orthoxylene. In 2020, we purchased approximately 79.5 kton of orthoxylene across our facilities. - Normal Butane: Normal butane is a component of liquefied petroleum gas and is used most often as a heating or transport fuel. We use normal butane to produce maleic anhydride at our Ravenna (Italy) plant. The substantial majority of the normal butane used at our Ravenna (Italy) plant is supplied via a direct pipeline that is integrated into the production facility itself. The purchase price we pay for normal butane is determined according to a contractual formula. The key factor in the formula is the average price of normal butane during the month of delivery, calculated according to different price indices. Our normal butane supply via a pipeline is governed by a supply agreement with Ecofuel S.p.A. that is due to expire on December 31, 2021, but we expect will be renewed for a further term. We also have other minor supplier agreements in Europe for normal butane. In 2020, we purchased approximately 56.3 kton of normal butane across our facilities. - Dienes: Dienes are raw materials sourced from hydrocarbon molecules that have two double carbon bonds. The dienes we use most frequently are butadiene, a precursor to synthetic polymers, and isoprene, a precursor to synthetic rubber and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), an alternative raw material for UPR. We use dienes to produce our anhydrides in our Scanzorosciate (Italy), Ravenna (Italy) plants. We use DCPD in about 25 plants worldwide for the production of UPR. We have renewable annual supply agreements with our suppliers for our supply of dienes. DCPD is typically sourced in China on a spot basis, while minor volumes are sourced locally in U.S. and Europe. In 2020 we purchased approximately 29.1 kton of dienes across our facilities. ----- - Phthalic Anhydride: Phthalic Anhydride is a key raw material for both UPR and Alkyds. In 2020, we purchased approximately 24,800 mt of phthalic anhydride in the Americas throughout 14 plants. The majority of the supply is secured by long term contracts with price formulas and through intragroup supplies from our Italian entities. Phthalic Anhydride in Asia is used in all the plants and sourced locally on a spot basis. - Epoxy: Epoxy resins are raw materials for vinyl ester resins and come indifferent grades. We used approximately 11.2 kt of epoxy globally in 2020. Epoxy are sourced from local producers. In addition, we buy some material in the U.S. and EU from Asian manufacturers. Price is formula-based for the U.S. and European producers, related to the published market assessments. In Asia, Epoxy is bought on a spot basis. In the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, epoxy resin production suffered from a reduction in production due to outages of epoxy and their feedstocks and to logistic constraints for materials. As a result, the price of epoxy resin in June 2021 was almost triple that of prices in June 2020. - DEG: Diethylene Glycol (DEG) is a glycol used for UPR. It is a byproduct of the production monoethylene glycol (MEG). We consume approximately about 40 kt per year of DEG globally, divided in proportion to the UPR production of each site. DEG is sourced from local producers in the U.S. and Asia. In Europe, approximately 75% of the volume is sourced from non-European producers, typically based in the Middle East and the U.S.. The price is spot-based in Asia, while in the U.S. and Europe is formula-based, related to published market assessments, through purchasing contracts. Regional managers are responsible for posting sales budgets into our information technology system and ensuring that the production facilities they oversee receive adequate supplies of raw materials. This data is subsequently reprocessed by our purchasing and logistics department. While our logistics staff is responsible for product handling, bagging and loading and unloading, our purchasing staff assesses the quantities of raw materials that are needed on an annual basis and draws up related purchasing budgets. Their assessment is based on our current inventories of each raw material and upon the amount of such material being consumed in our production processes. Once our needs are assessed, our purchasing and logistics office manager negotiates the relevant contract with the supplier and thereafter individual purchase orders are sent to our suppliers on a monthly basis. The majority of our raw materials are delivered “cost, insurance and freight” or “delivered at place”, meaning that shipping and delivery are arranged and paid for by the supplier. The majority of deliveries of raw materials are made by rail tanker, with a minority being delivered to our plants in tank trucks or isotanks. Additionally, at our Ravenna plant, we receive most of our normal butane by pipeline. We have relationships with almost 1,000 suppliers in approximately 30 different countries for our supply of raw materials. We, however, are dependent on relatively few key suppliers with whom we have strong, mutually-beneficial relationships for our strategic raw material. As part of our quality-management procedures, we seek to maintain long-term relationships with suppliers, which create a sense of cooperation and expectation of quality. Most of our purchases are made through purchase orders made either independently, or pursuant to long-term delivery/supply agreements which dictate minimum and maximum quantities of the specific raw material we must purchase in a given year and set price adjustment mechanisms usually keyed on the price of crude oil.

Our sales employees are divided into groups with each group specializing in a specific product. The sales staff for each of our product classes are supervised by a sales manager. Our pricing policies are set by the key management team, which includes the managers of our three product classes and our managing director. The key management team sets pricing guidelines based on input on market demand they receive from our sales staff. These guidelines are then implemented by each product line manager for their specific product line. Given the technical and specialized nature of our business, we train our sales staff to have detailed knowledge of our customers’ needs. Our strategy is that our sales staff be able to anticipate customer demands for new performance chemicals and technologies. This type of customer relationship and market awareness enable us to expand the types of products we offer by developing high-demand, new products quickly. Our internal sales staff also manages our business relationships with our most significant customers. We also work with smaller external sales agents who operate in specific geographic areas where we have business relationships with customers with whom we presently engage in smaller volumes of sale, primarily in Asia and South America. The majority of our Intermediates sales contracts have pricing mechanisms whereby pricing is set on a monthly or quarterly basis based on the Platt’s price index, an index that provides market data and commodities pricing specifically for the energy sector. We, therefore, analyze our pricing for each individual product on a monthly basis, as applicable, when setting contract prices so we can pass on changes in raw material costs to customers each month or quarter when the contract price is reset. In addition, the majority ----- of our contracts contain minimum and maximum volume clauses, which limit fluctuations in order size from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. We seek to protect our market share by entering into long-term sales contracts. The payment terms under these contracts are set in accordance with typical chemicals industry standards, on a country-by-country basis. The majority of our Composites and Specialties sales contracts are spot contracts renegotiated on a monthly basis. The prices of these contracts are set by negotiations between us and our customers. We believe that our positioning as a market leader in these two classes helps us maintain high margins in Composites and Specialties. Once a sale is made, our internal team of specialists provides our customers with after-sale technical assistance, particularly with regard to UPRs and plasticizers. We believe that combining an internal sales team that anticipates customer needs with post-sale customer support from product specialists fosters customer loyalty to our products and our brand and establishes long-term customer relationships. We have been supplying our top customers for the past 20 years. The majority of our products are shipped to customers directly from our manufacturing plants. In some cases, we also ship our products to distribution centers worldwide where they are held before being distributed to their final destination. We also use professional distributors to distribute malic acid and UPRs to certain of our smaller volume customers. As of June 30, 2021, distribution relationships amounted to approximately 10% of our total sales volume, with the remaining 90% being from our internal sales force. Our agreements with these distributors generally grant the distributors the exclusive right to distribute our products in specified territories, subject to certain exceptions, including our right to directly sell to any customers in the defined areas. Our distributor agreements are generally short-term agreements that renew automatically and can be terminated by either party after giving the appropriate notice, which varies depending on the jurisdiction but is usually not more than approximately 90 days’-notice.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

A high volume of strategically-located production facilities also allows us to be close to both our suppliers and customers so we can receive materials quickly and meet client needs on a timely basis. In addition, being close to suppliers and customers allows us to transport our raw materials and products at a lower cost to us. For example, some Intermediates, specifically liquid phthalic and maleic anhydride, are expensive to transport because they must be transported at temperatures between 70 and 180 degrees Celsius; moving them over shorter distances saves us on transportation costs. ----- _Tolling Agreements_ Following our combination with the Reichhold group, the Group put in place a series of intragroup agreements for the supply of goods between Group entities. Under these tolling agreements, entities formerly belonging to the Reichhold group make available to certain Polynt entities the entire production capacity of their plants. _Energy Sourcing_ Our key sources of energy and main utilities for our production activities are electricity, natural gas, nitrogen purchased from third parties, as well as internally-produced steam. Our energy costs, including CO2 costs related to the ETS, represented 4.4%, 4.5% and 5.2% of our total material and process energy costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. _Quality Control and Certification of Plants and Products_ Our analysis laboratories analyze and inspect the quality of raw materials received from our suppliers. Specifically these laboratories verify that the raw materials we receive contain the appropriate chemical properties and the other characteristics specified in our supply agreements. We typically require that raw materials are delivered to us by rail tank or tanker trucks to reduce the risk of contamination. Raw materials transported by sea are subject to a higher risk of contamination due to shipboard humidity and the routine washing of vessels. Given the higher risk of sea transportation, we retain inspection companies who perform initial inspections of ship-borne raw materials before and after they are loaded onto the ship as well after they are unloaded from the vessel. We perform a third inspection of shipborne raw materials once they arrive at our plant. We store raw materials that meet our quality specifications in dedicated storage tanks and warehouses specially designed to keep them free from contamination. Our analysis laboratories also perform quality control inspections of our finished products before sale to our customers. We have implemented required product quality and safety regulations and guidelines. These include regulations promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in Europe, the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) regulations of the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. and guidelines issued by the insurer Lloyds of London for gelcoat used in marine products worldwide.

As a result of the technical nature of our business, there is a high level of technical and professional qualifications among the management, and we place a high priority on technical training and personal and professional development for all staff. Historically, we have had a generally low turnover, although recently, a shortage in factory workers across the U.S. has resulted in a high turnover as workers move employers as they are offered higher wages. In some of our locations non-management personnel are represented by local trade unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In such locations, we work with trade unions in line with that country’s laws and regulations. In addition, we have employee works councils in France and Germany. Over the years, we have enjoyed a positive working relationship with our labor force and unions, and we are committed to maintaining these relationships going forward. We do not believe we have any ongoing labor disputes. We operate pension plans and other employee benefit and incentive plans in the various jurisdictions where we operate. In particular, SCIL has adopted in the exercise of its activity of direction and coordination and in the interest of the Group, two separate management incentive plans, in order to retain and reward certain managers and/or employees having a key role in the Group, which may be triggered by the Transactions (the “Management Bonuses”): - a phantom stock option plan, adopted on February 15, 2018, pursuant to which certain managers and employees of the Group are entitled to receive an extraordinary bonus upon fulfilment of the following conditions: (i) the occurrence of one of the following events within December 31, 2026: a change in ownership of the Target Group, the listing on a regulated market or distribution of an extraordinary maxi dividend; and (ii) the revaluation above a certain threshold of SCIL’s shares with respect to the reference value per share indicated in the underlying agreements; and - a separate “deal bonus plan”, entered into on December 15, 2020 with certain beneficiaries of the phantom stock option plan, pursuant to which the beneficiaries are entitled to receive an additional extraordinary bonus upon verification of additional conditions. ----- SCIL has entrusted Polynt S.p.A. with the implementation of the above management incentive plans.

As of June 30, 2021, we had made provisions of €23.0 million for ecological clean-up efforts. Except as detailed below, we do not believe that any of our current or prospective soil and groundwater clean-up activities are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and _Industry—We may be subject to ongoing costs and regulations related to contamination or exposure impacts from our operations or products”._ We are currently undertaking groundwater clean-up efforts at our Scanzorosciate (Italy) and San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy) plants, soil and groundwater clean-up efforts at our Drocourt (France) plant. We are performing the clean-up works at these sites in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. All required local and national authorities have been timely informed of our efforts and have duly authorized them, as required by applicable law and regulations. The groundwater clean-up at our Scanzorosciate (Italy) plant started in 2012, and at San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy) in 2008. At both of these sites we are cleaning the contaminated water using the “pump and treat”method whereby contaminated groundwater is pumped from the site and treated to remove the contaminants. The soil clean-up at our Drocourt (France) plant started in 2014 and was first conducted by means of air sparging techniques. The outcome of this treatment was not fully satisfactory. Therefore, we expect that a new project combining air sparging and hydraulic barrier methods will be implemented to clean-up the contaminated areas. In addition, soil and groundwater remediation is ongoing at several U.S. facilities acquired from Momentive in 2011. The Lynwood, California (United States) facility is undergoing remediation efforts to address environmental contamination in the site’s soil and groundwater resulting from the operation of chemical manufacturing facilities on the site since 1950. The ongoing remediation activities include groundwater extraction wells and soil vapor extraction wells. The Carpentersville, Illinois (United Sates) facility has ongoing soil vapor extraction to recover volatile organic compounds in the soil and groundwater monitoring. Under the terms of the purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired these facilities, Momentive has the obligation to indemnify us for environmental contamination remediation costs in a manner that caps our liability for such costs at $2.75 million. Specifically, we are liable for the first $2.0 million of any remediation costs. After this $2.0 million deductible is reached, Momentive is liable for seventy-five percent (75%) of any remediation costs between $2.0 million and $5.0 million. Momentive is also liable for all remediation costs in excess of $5.0 million. Our North Kansas City, Missouri (United States) facility, acquired in the CCP Acquisition, is undergoing ongoing long term groundwater monitoring of the identified environmental contamination in the facility’s soil and groundwater. The facility has known onsite contamination that is being addressed under an ongoing Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) cleanup action. A Risked Based Closure Plan, based on current site conditions, is currently being developed for submission to the State agency. Financial reserve have been established to address the anticipated liabilities identified at this facility. Studies to date have indicated various impacted areas of soil and groundwater at the site in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, that exceed the thresholds under Canadian law. No active remediation is currently ongoing, but may be required in the future. At the Brampton, Ontario, Canada site, studies to date have indicated various impacted areas of soil and groundwater above Canadian criteria for chlorinated solvents. Remedial activities have included excavation of impacted soil with localized in situ chemical oxidation (“ISCO”) employed. The site is fully delineated with respect to identified source areas; we have biannual monitoring procedures in place, which are also used to document the fact that no further mitigation measures are required.

In accordance with applicable law, we have initiated clean-up efforts at our Scanzorosciate (Italy), Cavaglià (Italy) and Parma (Italy) plants. The clean-up activities in our Italian plants began in 2006 and we ----- expect they will be completed within the deadlines set by applicable local regulations. There are also a limited number of sites in Europe where asbestos is present in the roofing or in the insulation of certain equipment (i.e. Miranda (Spain), Drocourt (France), Leek (UK), Mitcham (UK), and Stallingborough(UK)). The presence of asbestos at these sites is documented and carefully monitored according to the local regulations. Even if no removal is required by local regulation, clean-up activities are periodically carried out at these sites by licensed contractors. In addition, asbestos has been located at a few of our U.S. facilities, but in those cases due to the amount and location of the asbestos, local laws and regulations do not require that we undertake clean-up or removal efforts. We monitor all of our sites to make sure we remain in compliance with laws and regulations and to provide a safe work environment for our employees. Due to the age of many of our facilities in the Americas, many of these have been documented to have some form of asbestos containing materials present in the building material and/or process equipment (thermal insulation). However, the presence of asbestos is documented and closely managed through site specific plans. Abatement is performed in conjunction with facility maintenance/expansion activities by licensed contractors and is budgeted as an annual operations expense item.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.29,Environmental and Health and Safety Matters,18.29.4,Classification of Certain Products as Substances of Very High Concern by ECHA,"The European Chemical Agency (“ECHA”) has classified five of our products as Substances of Very High Concern under REACH. Although DOP/DEHP and DINP have already been included in the Authorization List, the first is only used in the production of medical devices (a business sector to which the authorization requirements under REACH do not currently apply) and the second is an intermediate which is exempted from authorization. In addition, while TMA, HHPA and MHHPA, are classified as Substances of Very High Concern, they are not currently on the Authorization List. However, since TMA and HHPA are mostly used as intermediate or monomer we expect that the impact to the related businesses will be minimal should these substances being placed in authorization list. The fifth, MHHPA, is a special anhydride whose classification could potentially lead to it being placed on the Authorization List which could result in increased future regulation, product controls and/or procedures that could make producing or using such products in our downstream production operations uneconomical, unmanageable or otherwise commercially inefficient. We joined with a number of other major European chemical companies in appealing the ECHA’s classification of both HHPA and MHHPA as Substances of Very High Concern. Final arguments were made before the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg on November 20, 2014, and on April 30, 2015, the EU Court of Justice issued a ruling denying our application to de-classify HHPA and MHHPA as Substances of Very High Concern. Despite the denial, they have still not been placed on the Authorization List. As of yet, classification of these special anhydrides as Substances of Very High Concern neither precludes their use by us nor does it impose increased regulation, product controls and/or procedures related to their production or use. We are pursuing other avenues to obtain an exemption from the authorization requirement and believe that the decision will not materially affect our business operations.

The most relevant of these laws and regulations to our business are described in “Regulation”. These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges, air emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, operation and closure of landfills, human health and safety, process safety and risk management and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures to ensure compliance with current and future HSE laws, regulations and permits or the more stringent enforcement of such requirements. Environmental regulations generally govern emissions into the atmosphere, water and soil, as well as the treatment, storage and elimination of residues from industrial production. The limits set forth in the applicable regulations often limit the quantity of raw materials and other substances that we can use in our products. Some of the raw materials we process are regulated as substances capable of causing an accident potentially dangerous for human health and the environment, such as a fire or explosion during plant operations. The Group has in place a sustainability policy that is executed by the chief executive officer of the Group. The Group continually works to reduce operational energy consumption through facility renovation and equipment upgrades. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize waste generation at all of our facilities. Our efforts to reduce industrial wastes include the beneficial reuse of used/spent solvents both internally and externally. We have also recently appointed an ESG manager, who will be responsible for internal auditing of ESG-related matters. With respect to risks related to our supply chain, this is managed and monitored at a corporate level as far as primary raw materials are concerned, whereas other raw materials are generally purchased locally under corporate supervision. We hold regular business meetings to coordinate our efforts and initiatives to reduce our supply chain risks. Additionally, we screen our suppliers against sanctions and embargo lists and we perform supply chain risk assessments and audits. We believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with all HSE laws, regulations and permits. We actively address compliance issues in connection with our operations and properties and we believe that we have systems in place to mitigate our environmental costs and liabilities.

We are not currently involved in any material legal, governmental or arbitration proceedings which could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, and, we are not aware of any material governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which we are aware), during the past three years, which may have, or have had in the recent past, adverse effects on our financial position or profitability. However, we note that: - Polynt Composites Brazil Ltda. (“PC Brazil”) and Reichhold do Brasil Ltda. (“Reichhold Brazil”) are involved in approximately 65 pending litigations in Brazil relating to civil, environmental, tax and labour disputes as defendants and approximately 110 pending litigations relating to civil disputes as plaintiffs. None of the proceedings is material. - PC Brazil and Reichhold Brazil are involved in administrative proceedings relating to an alleged cartel investigated by the Brazilian antitrust authority (“CADE”), which has not yet been subject to a final judgment. Although Reichhold Brazil signed a leniency agreement (granting Reichhold Brazil full administrative immunity, and criminal immunity to the individuals who signed the leniency agreement) and PC Brazil has entered into a settlement agreement (granting PC Brazil a discount on the applicable ----- fine), both agreements and full compliance with the obligations set out therein must be confirmed by CADE in its final decision regarding the case, which as of the date of this Offering Memorandum has not yet been issued. - On December 14, 2018, the Italian Tax Police (Guardia di Finanza) issued a notice of dispute (processo _verbale di contestazione, the “PVC”) against Polynt S.p.A. following a tax audit for the 2014, 2015,_ 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, and containing certain allegations in relation to which the Italian Tax Authority (Agenzia delle Entrate) identified additional tax payments allegedly due by Polynt S.p.A. in an aggregate amount of €13,683,274 plus interest and penalties. In December 2019, the Italian Tax Authority issued tax assessments for fiscal year 2014 against Polynt S.p.A. with respect to the matters identified in the PVC, claiming additional tax payments in an aggregate amount of €1,156,000 plus interest and penalties. The main allegations were with respect to (i) the royalty rate charged by Polynt S.p.A. to related parties in connection with the trademark “Polynt”, and (ii) a portion of certain costs borne by Polynt S.p.A. and allegendly not recharged or rebilled to the proper related party, being such expenses allegedly for the benefit of the whole Target Group. In order to prove the groundlessness of the Italian tax authorities’ allegations, in July 2020 Polynt S.p.A. started a tax litigation before the competent Tax Court. Further, in June 2021 the Italian Tax Authority issued two tax assessments against Polynt S.p.A. in relation to fiscal year 2015, claiming additional tax payments in an aggregate amount of €4,789,000 plus interest and penalties. In respect to these latter tax claims, in July 2021 Polynt S.p.A. filed a tax assessment settlement with the Italian tax authorities which is currently ongoing. Currently, the Group has allocated €6.2 million as provision for this matter. - Polynt Composites USA Inc. (“PC USA”) is a defendant (among others) in an alleged toxic injury case, in which the plaintiff is alleging that he developed cancer from his exposure to toxic chemicals he used throughout the course of his career as a mannequin manufacturer and seeking damages in excess of US$ 13,000,000. In addition, in April 2021, PC USA entered into a settlement for a non-material amount in a separate toxic injury case, in which it was alleged that the deceased had been exposed to chemicals produced by PC USA’s predecessor, Cook Composites Co., while the deceased was employed at a waste disposal company. - We are involved in a small number of claims in the United States for product liability, which we expect to resolve or settle for non-material amounts.

Our production facilities and operations are subject to both national and international regulatory regimes. In the Member States, the regulatory environment of our business activities is shaped by EU directives and regulations, which are either implemented in the individual Member States through national legislation or have direct application to the states or individuals. In the U.S., the regulatory environment is shaped by federal and state laws and regulations. Regulations that affect our operations mostly relate to areas of environmental protection, product safety and quality, occupational health and safety, industrial hygiene and plant safety. HSE laws and regulations govern our facilities and our operations, including: (i) the storage, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste; (ii) water intake, wastewater and sewage discharges; (iii) air emissions; (iv) human health and safety; (v) the clean-up and remediation of contaminated sites; and (vi) the sale and use of the products we manufacture.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,EU Regulations,58.2.1,Industry and Product Related Regulations,"_The Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals Regulation (“REACH Regulation”)_ The use, manufacture and importing of chemicals is highly regulated in the European Union. On June 1, 2007, Regulation 1907/2006 concerning REACH entered into force. The REACH Regulation, as subsequently amended, requires that chemical substances or preparations manufactured, imported or otherwise placed within the European Union in quantities exceeding one ton per year, be registered with the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). Full registration requires the provision of comprehensive data on the identification, properties, uses, classification and labeling of the relevant substance, exposure scenarios and, for substances which meet the requirements of Article 31(1) of REACH, for example because they are substances which are classified as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, a detailed chemical Safety Data Sheet. The registration process is aimed at generating data on chemicals and enhancing the safety of chemicals in their various uses within the European Union. Producers and importers of substances in the European Union must obtain information on the substances they manufacture or import to assess the risks arising from their use and to ensure that risks are properly managed. REACH, which came into force in 2007, provides for a registration process for the use or sale of substances deemed particularly hazardous and specified in Annex XIV of the regulation, an Authorization ----- will be required. The list of substances on this “Authorization List” is regularly reviewed and new substances can be added to the list. before they can be manufactured, imported or sold in the European Union. The manufacture and placing on the market of certain dangerous substances in the European Union is also restricted by REACH. The manufacture, importation or use of certain substances may be restricted or banned in the European Union under REACH. Annex XVII of the REACH Regulation lists these restricted substances and further substances may be added to this annex by the Commission. REACH also requires that certain information concerning chemical substances is made publicly available unless it is specifically marked as confidential. There are also additional legislative provisions in Europe, such as the Aarhus Convention, which grants public rights regarding access to information held by EU bodies and which could result in groups such as environmental pressure groups requesting and obtaining additional information on our products. Our spending on compliance with the REACH regulation amounted to approximately €10 million, including registration costs from the first REACH registration deadline in 2010 until June 30, 2021. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we cannot estimate an amount for future REACH compliance spending, but we believe that the expenses will be approximately €1 million per year over the next few years. _Classification, Labeling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures—CLP_ CLP works in connection with REACH to regulate and standardize these areas in the European Union. Obligations under CLP apply to manufacturers, importers, downstream users, distributors and persons who use substances caught by the CLP Regulation as a component to a larger product. The obligations under CLP depend on the role of the party in this supply chain. For example, manufactures and importers are obliged to ensure that their substances are classified, labeled and packaged in accordance with CLP before they are placed on the market. These classification and notification elements should be notified to the classification and labeling inventory established by the ECHA. The manufacturer and importer is also required to take all reasonable steps available to it to make it aware of any new scientific or technical information that may affect the classification of the substance and if required by this information undertake a new evaluation of the classification and labeling of the substance. The manufacturer and importer also have an ongoing obligation to update the classification and labeling of a substance if required. _Food Contact Controls_ Our European facilities produce substances which may come into contact with food. European Regulation 1935/2004, as subsequently amended, on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (the “Regulation 1935”) entered into force on December 3, 2004, and is directly applicable in Member States. It seeks to ensure the protection of human health and the interests of consumers with regard to materials and articles intended to come into contact with food, either directly or indirectly. Regulation 1935 applies to all materials and articles, including active and intelligent food contact materials and articles which in their finished state are already in contact, are intended to be brought into contact, or can reasonably be expected to be brought into contact, with food. Regulation 1935 requires materials and articles to be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice. The materials and articles must not transfer substances to the food with which they are in contact in quantities likely to endanger human health or which could bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the food or deterioration in certain characteristics of the food. If active or intelligent materials and articles intentionally change the composition, or certain characteristics, of food, they must comply with additional provisions in Directive 89/107/EEC as implemented. For certain materials and articles listed in Regulation 1935, the Commission may also adopt specific measures. In the absence of Community level specific measures, Member States may maintain or adopt national provisions provided they comply with the rules of the EC Treaty. The list of specific measures which may be adopted for the materials and articles listed in Annex I to the Regulation include, for example, limits on the migration of certain constituents into or onto food and specific procedural rules for the authorization of a substance, process, material or article. Where a list of authorized substances is adopted for a certain material or article as a specific measure (at a Community or national level), the relevant substances have to undergo a safety assessment prior to their authorization. Any new applications for the authorization of a substance used in the manufacture of materials or articles intended to come into contact with food must be made to the competent authority of the Member ----- State where the substance is to be placed on the market and also to the European Food Safety Authority. The authorization of a new substance will be made in the form of a Community level specific measure. Materials and articles must be labeled appropriately and the traceability of a material or article (and, where appropriate, the substances used in their manufacture) must be ensured at all times. Additionally, Regulation 10/2011 applies. This is a specific measure within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. This Regulation should establish the specific rules for plastic materials and articles to be applied for their safe use and repeals Commission Directive 2002/72/EC of August 6, 2002 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,EU Regulations,58.2.2,"Environment, Health and Safety Regulations","Our manufacturing sites in Europe are subject to significant regulation regarding the operation of chemical plants both at EU-wide level and also at the level of individual Member States, who, as well as having individual legislation implementing applicable European environmental directives may have state specific legislation which may impose stricter controls or requirements than the EU-wide level legislation. Regulation of environmental and health and safety issues is considerable. Legislation has been adopted in diverse areas, including but not limited to, waste prevention and control, fire safety, protection against explosive hazards, storage, transport and use of hazardous substances, air emissions, wastewater management and discharges, environmental liability, integrated permitting, noise and groundwater protection. Member States typically have a certain degree of national authority to choose means of implementing an EU Directive, though its timing and main purpose and objectives are binding upon Member States. EU Regulations are binding on individual Member States without requiring national legislation. These EU Directives and Regulations set a common EU-wide standard of operation that, in some cases, may be made stricter by Member States’ authorities. Other areas of law, especially contaminated land regulations, are largely a matter of domestic Member State law, with limited EU-wide harmonization, regarding permit granting procedures or enforcement. Fines and penalties for non-compliance with environmental and health and safety issues vary across Member States, but most Member States impose some sort of penalty on such noncompliance. _Industrial Emissions Directive_ The Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU), as subsequently amended, amends, consolidates and replaces seven pieces of EU legislation controlling industrial emissions (the “IED”). It came into force on January 6, 2011 and most installations will be required to comply with the IED from January 7, 2014. It covers a wide range of industrial installations which operate above certain thresholds in a variety of industry sectors, including the chemicals industry. The IED’s aims are to prevent or reduce emissions from industrial installations to air, land and water. It requires, among other things, that installations which fall within its scope to operate under a permit and such permits are to be conditional on “BAT conclusions”. Best Available Techniques (“BAT”) conclusions are documents which set out what constitutes the BAT for a particular activity, including emissions levels, monitoring and remediation. When an installation is closed the IED also requires that permitting authorities must ensure that steps are taken to avoid any pollution caused by the closure of the site and that measures are taken to return the site to a satisfactory state. Operators of sites which use hazardous substances are required to prepare a baseline report setting out information that will enable the state of contamination of soil and ground water at the site to be compared when the site is closed. Through Legislative Decree no. 46/2014 (which amended the existing Legislative Decree no. 152/2006 (also called the Italian Environmental Code)) Italy implemented the IED. Our European facilities are subject to Member States’ laws implementing Directive 89/391, as subsequently amended, on measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers (the “HSW Directive”). The HSW Directive, as subsequently amended, aims to eliminate the risk factors for occupational diseases and accidents by establishing rules on protecting the health and safety of workers. Its provisions relate to all sectors of activity, both public and private. An employer under the HSW Directive has a duty to ensure the health and safety of workers in every aspect of their work, including if they enlist external companies or persons. While workers are required to take care of their own safety and health in accordance with their training, the obligations on an employer require it to take the measures necessary for the safety and health protection of workers based on a system of adaptable risk prevention and management, the provision of information to workers, common protective measures and training, and the provision of the necessary organization and means for the protection of workers. ----- Employers must also adapt first aid, fire-fighting and evacuation procedures to the activities and size of the relevant activity. Again, protective and preventative services must be established, including the appointment of trained workers, to enable the employer to react to serious danger. Workers must be consulted regarding health and safety issues in the workplace and employers are required to ensure that they monitor the health of workers in accordance with national legislation, including regular health checks if requested. The HSW Directive, as subsequently amended, was implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 81/2008 as subsequently amended, inter alia, by the Legislative Degree no. 32/2013. _Contest of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances_ Our European facilities are subject to Member States’ implementation of Directive 96/82/EC relating to the prevention and management of incidents in relation to the use, manufacture and storage of hazardous substances, as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC (the “SEVESO II Directive”). The SEVESO II Directive has been amended by Directive 2012/18/EU (the “SEVESO III Directive”) which came into force on August 13, 2012 and repeals and replaces the SEVESO II Directive from June 1, 2015. The SEVESO III Directive aims are the prevention of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances and the limitation of the consequences of any such accidents if they do occur. The SEVESO III Directive provides for three levels of proportionate controls which in practice means that operations storing larger quantities of dangerous substances are under more controls. “Upper tier establishments”companies are establishments in which dangerous substances are present in quantities which exceed threshold value determined in the SEVESO III Directive. These installations are subject to all of the requirements of the SEVESO III Directive, including submitting a notification to the relevant authority, establishing a major accident prevention policy and a safety management system, submitting a safety report and emergency plan to the relevant local authorities and prepare external emergency plans, which are subject to public consultation. Upper tier establishments are also required to regularly test their internal and external emergency plans. The SEVESO III Directive was implemented in Italy through Italian Legislative Decree No. 105/2015. _Fire Security and Explosion Hazard Rules_ Since July 2003 organizations in the European Union are required to follow the ATEX Directives. ATEX 95 (Directive 94/9/EC) regulated safety devices and equipment intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. On April 20, 2016, a new ATEX 114 (Directive 2014/34/EU) came into force, repealing ATEX 95. The essential parts of the directive relating to scope and classification have not changed, while new definitions, new requirements for notified bodies and a common template for the EU declaration of conformity have been introduced. Under ATEX114, equipment and protective devices and systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres have to meet essential safety and health requirements; as a result, all protective equipment at our facilities must conform with these requirements. ATEX 114 was implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree no. 85/2016 (while ATEX 95 was implemented through Presidential Decree no. 126/1998). In addition ATEX 137 (Directive 99/92/EC, as subsequently amended) established minim requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from flammable atmospheres. ATEX 137 was implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree no. 233/03. Under ATEX 137 rules Under ATEX 137 rules, employers must ensure the health and safety of workers by taking all organizational and/or technical measures to prevent the formation of an explosive environment or, where the nature of the activity precludes this, to remove sources of ignition, and mitigate the detrimental effects of an explosion. Where necessary, these measures shall be combined and/or supplemented with measures to prevent the propagation of explosions. Essentially, employers are required to classify areas where hazardous explosive atmospheres may occur at their installation into zones. The classification given to an area relates to the chances of an explosive atmosphere occurring and being maintained. The employer is also required to produce an “Explosion Protection Document” which, among other things, is required to demonstrate that explosion risks have been determined and assessed, hazardous areas have been classified into zones and appropriate signs displayed, workplace and work equipment designed, operated and maintained with due regard for safety, and that procedures are in place for the safe use of equipment. Ensuring that these ATEX Directives are complied with can include the performance of modification work, such as screening and/or the ventilating certain particular areas. _Pressure Equipment Directive_ The Pressure Equipment Directive (Directive 2014/68/EU) (the “PED”) sets out the standards for the design, manufacture, testing and conformity assessment of pressure equipment and assemblies of pressure ----- equipment constituting an integrated whole. Pressure equipment means steam boilers, pressure vessels, piping, safety valves and other components and assemblies subject to pressure loading, generally over 25 liters in volume and subject to a maximum allowable pressure greater than 0.5 bar (i.e., 0.5 bar above atmospheric pressure) that pose a hazard due to pressure. All pressure equipment and assemblies within the scope of the PED must be safe when placed on the market and put into service. Member States must take steps to ensure that pressure equipment cannot be placed on the market if, when installed, maintained or used, risks are adequately controlled, the design and the manufacture of pressure equipment are subject to essential safety requirements. This new approach means that Member States cannot prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market or putting into service of pressure equipment complying with the provisions of the Directive. Directive 97/93/EC has been implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree 25 February 2000 no. 93, while Directive 2014/68/EU has been implemented through Legislative Decree no. 26/2016. _International Transport of Dangerous Goods_ The international transport of dangerous goods is regulated by international agreements concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (“ADR”) and by Rail (“RID”). Moreover, it is regulated by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (the “IMDG”), developed by the International Maritime Organization as a uniform international code for the transport of dangerous goods by sea covering such matters as packing, container traffic and stowage, with particular reference to the segregation of incompatible substances. The ADR and RID have drawn up a list of dangerous goods, indicating whether their transport is prohibited or not and defining the requirements for their transport if it is authorized. Moreover, these agreements, which are regularly amended and updated since their entry into force, establish, inter alia, provisions regarding packaging and labeling of the goods, and construction, equipment and operation of the vehicle carrying the goods in question. At the EU level, Directive 2008/68/EC establishes a common regime for all aspects of the inland transport of dangerous goods, by road, rail and inland waterways within the European Union, making reference to the texts of the mentioned international agreements. Directive 2008/68/EC, as subsequently amended, has been implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree 27 January 2010 no. 35. _Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Emissions Trading Rules_ The European Union’s implementation of the Kyoto Protocol’s requirements regarding greenhouse gas emission reductions consists of a wide variety of rules and regulations to reduce the European Union’s carbon footprint in the areas of energy efficiency regulations, carbon dioxide emissions allowances trading, renewable energy requirements and construction requirements for the energy efficiency of buildings. It also imposes certain energy efficiency requirements for energy-using end products. The European Union’s emission trading scheme (“EU ETS”) establishes a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the EU. The EU ETS and the related legislation covers many installations in the chemicals sector by virtue of operating large combustion installations (20MW or over) such as boiler houses and generators. Operators of such an installation are required to monitor all emissions of carbon dioxide from the installation and to surrender allowances in respect of them. In particular, such installations receive a certain number of allowances to emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases (European Union Allowances -“EUA”) and must surrender one allowance for each ton of a greenhouse gas emitted. Sites that emit fewer tons of greenhouse gases than their allowances cover are able to sell the excess allowances in the open market, whereas those that emit more must buy additional allowances through the EU ETS. Allocation of EUA has been largely for free, with each Member State receiving an allocation of EUAs and then subsequently allocating them to installations caught by the EU ETS through a National Allocations Plan. The EU ETS mechanism is split into different phases, Phase I of the EU ETS ran from 2005 to 2007, Phase II ran from 2008 to 2012, coinciding with the commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and Phase III ran from 2013 to 2020. The EU ETS is now in its fourth phase (“Phase IV”), running from 2021 to 2030. The European Union has set an overall environmental target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and a 30% reduction if an international agreement is reached under which other developed countries commit to comparable efforts. The changes to the EU ETS for Phase III are part of the European Union’s climate and energy package, which is designed to help achieve these targets. Phase III covered, inter alia, the releases of carbon dioxide from the production of bulk organic chemicals and the releases of nitrous oxide from the production of nitric, adipic, glyoxal and glyoxylic acid. During Phase III, a single EU-wide cap on emissions applied in place of the previous system of national caps, therefore Member States received and allocated fewer EUAs and certain types of installations received no free EUA ----- allocation. Moreover, auctioning, not free allocation, is the new default method for allocating allowances. As a result, since free allocations are far more severely restricted, a large number of EU installations are required to purchase their EUAs through an auction or through the emissions trading markets instead. Even if an installation does qualify to receive free allocations of EUAs, the proportion of free EUAs will decrease over time. The amount of EUAs a qualifying installation received during Phase III was linked to a “benchmark” emissions level calculated, as a starting point, on the basis of the top 10% of the most GHG efficient EU installations in the sector or subsector for a product. Installations which were not as efficient as these top 10% plants were required to purchase additional EUAs to cover their higher level emissions or invest in new technology to bring their emission levels in line with these top 10% installations. To achieve the EU’s overall greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2030, the sectors covered by the EU ETS must reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels. The revised EU ETS Directive (Phase IV), which will apply for the period 2021-2030, will enable this through a mix of interlinked measures. The changes introduced by Phase IV mainly include strengthening the role of the ETS as an investment driver by increasing the rate of annual allowance reduction to 2.2% (linear reduction factor) from 2021 and strengthening the Market Stability Reserve (a mechanism established by the EU in 2015 to reduce surplus allowances in the carbon market and increase the resilience of the EU ETS to future shocks), continuing to allocate free allowances as a safeguard for the international competitiveness of industrial sectors at risk of carbon leakage, while ensuring that the rules for determining free allocation are targeted and take into account technological progress and supporting industry and the energy sector to enable them to meet the innovation and investment challenges of the transition to a low-carbon economy through various low-carbon financing mechanisms. The number of free allowances allocated also depends on whether an installation falls within a sector which is deemed to be vulnerable to “carbon leakage,” a phenomenon by which tighter regulation drives production out of Europe to countries where emissions of greenhouse gases are not constrained and production is therefore cheaper. Decision 2010/2/EU and, more recently, Decision 2014/746/EU designated the (sub) sectors which are deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage. The manufacture of bulk organic chemicals has been included in this list. Those sectors deemed to be exposed to such risk will be eligible to receive a greater proportion of free allowances. The EU ETS was implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree no. 216/2006. At the international level, in December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the United States and China, agreed to support the Copenhagen Accord, which endorsed the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol and includes a nonbinding commitment on several countries to reduce their GHG emissions. The international community in December 2015 adopted the Paris Agreement, a global climate change agreement aimed at limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The agreement called for nations to submit nationally determined contributions that set forth the actions individual countries will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement by 2020. These plans are then to be strengthened in the years to come. The Paris Agreement also requires countries to report regularly on their emissions and implementation efforts. There will also be a global review every 5 years to assess progess towards meeting the agreement’s goals. _Environmental Liability and Waste Framework Directives_ Our European facilities will be subject to a range of national laws concerning contaminated land and water. The Environmental Liability Directive (Directive 2004/35/EC) (the “ELD”) came into force on April 30, 2004 and aims to prevent and remedy environmental damage by establishing a framework for environmental liability based on the “polluter pays” principle. Environmental damage includes direct or indirect damage to protected species and natural habitats, water damage and land damage creating a significant risk to human health. Its fundamental aim is to hold operators whose activities have caused environmental damage financially liable for remedying the damage. In addition, the directive holds those whose activities caused an imminent threat of environmental damage liable to taking preventative actions. The ELD establishes a principle of liability where it is possible to demonstrate a causal link between environmental damage, or the imminent threat of damage, and certain occupational activities. The ELD lists those activities which include installations producing dangerous chemical substances. In certain circumstances the operator of a listed activity may be held liable for environmental damage on a strict liability basis. Liability for damage or the imminent threat of damage will be fault based where it arises from an activity outside those specifically listed in the ELD. Where there is an imminent threat of environmental damage, a Member State’s competent authority may require an operator to take preventive measures or the authority can take the necessary preventive measures ----- itself and recover any costs incurred. Where environmental damage has already occurred, the competent authority has the power to require the operator responsible to take the necessary restorative measures or, again, the authority can take those measures itself and recover any costs incurred. The ELD was implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree no. 152/2006, as subsequently amended. In addition, our European business is subject to a wider range of waste laws. The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98) (the “WFD”), as subsequently amended, aims to protect the environment and human health through the prevention of the harmful effects of waste generation and management. Member States are required to take measures for the treatment of waste in line with the waste hierarchy (set out below) which prioritizes how waste in Europe should be managed: prevention; preparing for reuse; recycling; other recovery, notably energy recovery; and disposal. In accordance with the “polluter pays” principle, the costs of waste management are to be borne by the original waste producer or by the current or previous waste holders. Any producer or holder of waste is required to carry out its own waste treatment or have treatment carried out by another establishment. Hazardous waste is prohibited from being mixed, requires appropriate labeling and packaging, and also requires storage and treatment in conditions that ensure the protection of health and the environment. Under the WFD, an establishment which intends to carry out waste treatment is obligated to obtain a permit from the relevant competent authority which will determine the quantity and type of treated waste, the method used, and monitoring and control operations allowed under the permit. The competent authorities of each Member State must establish waste management plans and prevention programs. These plans contain, notably, the type, quantity and source of waste, existing collection systems and location criteria. The prevention programs had to be established no later than December 12, 2013. Italy adopted the “National Program of Waste Prevention” on October 7, 2013. _European Feed Regulation: Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003_ Preservatives and other such substances produced in our European facilities will, if used in animal nutrition, be subject to Regulation 1831/2003 (the “Feed Additives Regulation”), as subsequently amended, which sets out rules for the authorization, supervision and labeling of feed additives. These rules aim to establish a community-wide procedure for authorizing the placing on the market and use of feed additives. Under the Feed Additives Regulation, no additive can be placed on the market, processed or used unless it is covered by an authorization granted under the Feed Additives Regulation and various conditions, including appropriate labeling (by, among others, the producer of the substance), have been met. Applications for the authorizations of feed additives are sent via the European Commission to the European Food Safety Authority (the “EFSA”). The EFSA conducts an evaluation of the relevant data and provides the Commission with a decision within six months. The Commission is then responsible for drafting a Regulation to either grant or deny authorization following a procedure that involves the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health—Animal Nutrition (established by Regulation 178/2002). Under the Feed Additives Regulation, the Commission is responsible for establishing a register of authorized feed additives. In this respect, certain transitional measures exist within the Feed Additives Regulation to cover applications for the re-evaluation of certain feed additives on the register whereby the application for re-evaluation must be made by a certain date or the additive must be withdrawn from the market. _European Green Deal_ The European Green Deal is a set of policy initiatives of the European Commission with the overarching aim of making Europe carbon neutral by 2050. In the context of the European Green Deal, the National Emissions reduction Commitments (NEC) Directive (2016/2284/EU) sets more ambitious reduction commitments for 2030 in order to reduce the health impacts of air pollution by half compared with 2005. The NEC Directive introduces a number of reporting requirements for Member States, highlighting the importance of such reports for assessing the progress in the reduction of air pollution in the EU and for ascertaining whether Member States are in compliance with their commitments. Moreover, the revised Renewal Energy Directive (COM(2021) 557 final)—tabled by the European Commission on 14 July 2021—introduces amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive (REDII— ----- Directive (EU) 2018/2001), Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and Directive 98/70/EC as regards the promotion of energy from renewable sources, repealing Council Directive (EU) 2015/652. Such amendments aim to introduce an increased target to produce 40% of energy from renewable sources by 2030, proposing specific targets for renewable energy use and strengthening sustainability criteria for the use of bioenergy. The implementation of the aforementioned measures may lead to an increase in carbon pricing, which would affect our industry, given the relatively high amount of carbon emitted at some of our facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Among other things, under TSCA the EPA has the authority to: (i) require testing of chemicals; (ii) undertake pre-market review and impose restrictions upon new chemicals; (iii) limit or prohibit the manufacture, use, distribution and disposal of chemical substances; (iv) impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and (v) regulate the export and import of chemical substances. In recent years, the EPA has also undertaken efforts to more stringently and comprehensively enforce TSCA. For example, the EPA has issued “chemical action plans” and has identified a work plan for further review and risk assessment of additional chemicals over the next several years. The EPA may impose civil and criminal liability for TSCA violations. In recent years there have been a number of proposals to significantly amend or reform TSCA, including through federal legislative proposals that have repeatedly been introduced in the U.S. Congress. On June 22, 2016, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety For the 21[st] Century Act was signed into law, which amended TSCA in significant ways. The law includes a mandatory requirement for EPA to evaluate existing chemicals within established deadlines, provides for risk-based chemical assessments, creates more public transparency on chemical information, and provides funding for the EPA to carry out its responsibilities under TSCA. We perform regular TSCA reviews and to confirm that all chemicals manufactured (and/or imported) are listed on the active TSCA chemical list and otherwise comply with all TSCA requirements. Our products in the U.S. are TSCA (active) listed, as required by TSCA regulations. Currently, phthalic anhydride is the only one of our products that is a high priority risk-based substance currently under risk assessment review by USEPA under TSCA. As the EPA intends to add more chemicals to their priority list, we cannot predict the long term impact of TSCA to our product portfolio and economic conditions will be. In addition, numerous state, local and industry groups have implemented so-called green chemistry or similar chemicals focused initiatives to identify, prioritize, and restrict existing chemicals. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) is also currently phasing in a hazard communication regulation intended to harmonize the U.S. system of Material Safety Data sheet hazard information with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. These or other similar future changes to chemicals regulation in the U.S. could place additional substantial regulatory burdens on the industry.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA may require that we install controls at or make other changes to our facilities. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be significant. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations could result in substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions. The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain permits for the construction, modification, and operation of our equipment, comply with permit requirements, and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our facilities. Measures have been taken to comply with various regulations specific to our operations, such as: National Ambient Air Quality Standards applicable to emissions of criteria pollutants including particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide and lead; the New Source Review Program requiring that new or modified sources install stringent control technology; National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants; and, New Source Performance ----- Standards.

We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and believe that our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. Given that the EPA is engaged in ongoing GHG rulemaking, and in light of legislative and judicial challenges to the EPA action, significant uncertainty currently exists as to how GHG regulations will in the future impact our facilities in the United States, and what costs or operational changes these regulations may require. In addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs, including the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and California’s AB32 cap-and-trade program. The proposed and existing programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Additional future regulation of GHGs in the United States could occur pursuant to future international treaty obligations, regulatory changes under the CAA or other existing legislation, or federal, state or regional adoption of GHG regulatory schemes. This could cause us to incur additional costs in complying with any new regulations, which may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under the CERCLA is strict, retroactive and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. The RCRA regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Under the RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under the RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances.

In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (“EPCRA”) and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and ----- regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Of particular relevance to our operations, OSHA’s standard on Process Safety Management (“PSM”) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals contains requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals. OSHA’s PSM regulations are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of unexpected releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive liquids and gases in chemical processes. The PSM covers facilities that deal with any of certain listed toxic and reactive chemicals and flammable liquids and gases in amounts over specified threshold quantities. The PSM requires process hazard analysis, a systematic study of events that could cause hazardous substance releases and the safeguards to prevent them. Employers must perform an initial hazard analysis on all processes covered by the standard and update the analysis at least every five years. Among other things, the PSM also mandates written operating procedures, employee training, pre-startup safety reviews, evaluation of mechanical integrity of equipment, written procedures for managing change, investigation of incidents involving releases or near misses of covered chemicals, emergency action plans and compliance audits. A few of our manufacturing facilities are also subject to the EPA’s CAA Risk Management Program (“RMP”), which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly hazardous chemicals to develop a risk management plan and program in the event of an accidental release of such chemicals. The RMP also requires facilities to assess potential impacts to off-site populations in the event of a credible worst-case release and to document the policies, procedures, equipment and work practices in place to mitigate identified risks.

Each Senior Secured Creditor and Super Senior Creditor on one hand and each other creditor bound by the Intercreditor Agreement on the other acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any lien granted on the assets of any U.S. person that constitute Collateral, any such grants of Collateral to each of them pursuant to the security documents will constitute two separate and distinct grants of security and because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the liabilities (other than the Priority Liabilities) are fundamentally different from the Priority Liabilities and must be separately classified in any US Insolvency Proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, ----- if it is held that the claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Super Senior Creditors on the one hand and the other creditors bound by the Intercreditor Agreement on the other in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then each of the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement shall acknowledge and agree that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the debtors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the creditors (other than Senior Secured Creditors and Super Senior Creditors)), the Senior Secured Creditors and the Super Senior Creditors shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing (or that would be owing if there were such separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) in respect of post-petition interest (including any additional interest payable pursuant to the definitive documents under the Priority Liabilites, arising from or related to a default, which is disallowed as a claim in any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by any other creditor with respect to the Collateral, with each such other creditor, shall acknowledge and agree to turn over to the security agent, on behalf of each Senior Secured Creditor and Super Senior Creditor, the Collateral or proceeds thereof otherwise received or receivable by them to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of such creditor). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Intercreditor Agreement (i) shall not apply with respect to the Existing ABL Facility (or any facility that amends, restated, replaces or refinances the Existing ABL Facility, in whole or in part), (ii) shall not bind any agent or lender party to the Existing ABL Facility (or any facility that amends, restated, replaces or refinances the Existing ABL Facility, in whole or in part), and (iii) shall not restrict or limit in any way, any actions of the agent and lenders party to the Existing ABL Facility (or any facility that amends, restated, replaces or refinances the Existing ABL Facility, in whole or in part).",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The Notes will mature on, 2026. The Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Dollar Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will: - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid; - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2022; - be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date (for the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Dollar Notes held in global form); and - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus (ii) %, as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined below). Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will: - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid; - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on and of each year, commencing on ; - be payable to the Holder of record of such Euro Floating Rate Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date (for Euro Floating Rate Notes held in global form); and - be computed on the basis of a 365-day year. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Euro Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365 provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of the Floating Rate Notes outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)).

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes. “Calculation Agent” means a financial institution appointed by the Issuer to calculate the interest rate payable on the Euro Floating Rate Notes in respect of each interest period, which shall initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. “Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels ----- time, on the Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0.00%. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuers will request (or cause to be requested) that the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuers, provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro-zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuers will request (or cause to be requested) that each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuers, provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date.

The Issuers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that (x) on or about the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Completion Date Guarantor will guarantee the Notes and (y) within 120 days after the Acquisition Closing Date (the “Cut-Off Date”), subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Post Completion Date Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the Guarantors accounted for % of the Target Group’s consolidated total assets, % of the Target Group’s total revenue and % of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA, after the elimination of intercompany balances. As described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Public Debt or certain other Indebtedness, in each case of the Issuers or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the purposes of this “Description of Notes,” “Guarantor” means the Completion Date Guarantor, the Post Completion Date Guarantors and any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture on or after the Acquisition Closing Date (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto). The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital and capital maintenance rules, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by each relevant ----- Guarantor. Additionally, the Guarantees will be subject to compliance with certain corporate law procedures. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations” and “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral— Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.” The_ Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that will apply to, and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes, which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal or tax limitations or requirements. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. The Issuers are special purpose vehicles established in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating operations of their own. As of the Issue Date, the Issuers will have no Subsidiaries, except that the US Co-Issuer is a subsidiary of the Parent. Following the Acquisition Closing Date, substantially all of the operations of the Issuers will be conducted through their Subsidiaries, which will initially consist of the Target Group. As a result of the Post-Transaction Reorganization, the US Co-Issuer will indirectly control the Group’s U.S. incorporated subsidiaries, other than Reichhold LLC 2, allowing for a more efficient distribution of cash to the US Co-Issuer to service its debt from the Offering. Under certain jurisdictions of the members of the Target Group, cash and cash equivalents held by the Target and its Subsidiaries can be upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities, including to the Issuers for purposes of servicing the Notes, to the extent that sufficient cumulative distributable profits and cumulative reserves exist within these legal entities and that they continue to meet relevant minimum capital requirements. As a result, following the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuers will be dependent upon dividends and other payments from their Subsidiaries, including pursuant to the Notes Proceeds Loan, to generate the funds necessary to meet its outstanding indebtedness service (including under the Notes) and other obligations, and such dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing our indebtedness, including any financing agreements of our Subsidiaries. Our Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. See “Risk factors— _Risks Related to Our Capital Structure—We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise.”_ Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuers will guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuers (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The _Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries (other than the US Co-Issuer).”_ As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of the proceeds therefrom, the Parent’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes, other than the US Co-Issuer would have had approximately €2,433,565 of outstanding Total financial indebtedness that is structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees (i.e., incurred at Subsidiaries of the Parent other than the US Co-Issuer and the Guarantors). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuers to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer or repurchase any Notes as described under this heading “—Change of Control”upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption with respect to each series of Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as defined under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the covenant described under this heading “—Change of Control.”. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuers, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuers as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuers or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption. The Issuers’ ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would at the option of each lender require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers or their Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers. Finally, the Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuers’ then existing financial resources, including financial resources of its Restricted Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds ----- will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the _Notes, the Guarantees and the collateral—The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any other Person other than certain “Permitted Holders”. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all”of the property or assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

and (13) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness,” the Parent shall be in Default of this covenant)._ Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial Calculations” below, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (ii) of the Target Group outstanding on the Acquisition Closing Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Acquisition Closing Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial Calculations” below, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors or an Officer acting in good faith. _Additional Limitations on Intellectual Property Transfers_ Neither the Parent nor any Restricted Subsidiary will transfer or contribute as an Investment, Restricted Payment, sale or otherwise, whether directly or indirectly or by one or more transactions, the ownership of any intellectual property that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management of the Parent is material to the business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to an Affiliate that is not a Restricted Subsidiary. _Limitation on Liens_ The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly secured, at least equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens. Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates or (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Release of Liens.” With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing such Indebtedness. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, prior to the Release, the Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien securing any Indebtedness over the Escrow Accounts or the Escrowed Property, in each case other than Liens (x) granted to secure the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture or (y) described in clause (1) of the definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens.” _Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_ The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; ----- (2) make any loans or advances to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_ dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock or other common equity interests and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction. The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit: (1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility), the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents, the Escrow Charge and the security documents relating to the foregoing, (b) the Acquisition Agreement, (c) any ABL Facility and any loan documents entered into in connection thereto, (d) any other agreement or instrument, in each case in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, or (e) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the Target Group in effect at or entered into on the Acquisition Closing Date;

provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is a Successor Issuer (as defined under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and _Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such_ Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes a Successor Issuer; (3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument (a) are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Parent) or (b) are customary in comparable financings and where, in the case of this sub-clause (b), the Parent determines at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions would not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuers’ ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Parent);

or (c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; ----- (5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired in the nature of clause (3) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture; (6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition; (7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business; (8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses, concessions, franchises or permits, including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits (including assets in escrow accounts) paid on property;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing; (13) any encumbrance or restriction by operation of law pursuant to the existence or formation of a fiscal unity (fiscale eenheid) for Dutch corporate income tax and/or value added tax purposes consisting between solely members of the Target Group; and (14) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Liens.” Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_ The Parent will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition: (1) unless the consideration the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the Capital Stock, property or other assets subject to such Asset Disposition (as determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Parent); and (2) except where the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap at least 75% of the consideration the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition consists of: (i) cash (including any Net Available Cash received from the conversion within 180 days of such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Disposition); ----- (ii) Cash Equivalents; (iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary), as a result of which neither the Parent nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Parent and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

or (viii)a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this paragraph (2). If the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances described in clause (8) below) of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, to: (1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; (ii) unless included in (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Notes or Indebtedness of the Parent or any Guarantor or the US Co-Issuer that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a senior or pari passu basis with the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (x) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or the US Co-Issuer or (y) any Indebtedness of the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral; provided that, the Parent shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is Public Debt (other than the Notes) pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuers either (1) reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on an equal and ratable basis with any such Indebtedness by redeeming Notes in accordance with the redemption provisions of the Indenture or by purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices or (2) make (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes); (2) (A) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of the Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the repurchase date), provided that to the extent the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to purchase any amount of the Notes at a price not less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, to the extent Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the Parent will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered, and such amount shall not ----- increase the amount of Excess Proceeds, or (B) redeem any series of Notes in accordance with the redemption provisions of the Indenture; (3) invest in any Replacement Assets; (4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; (5) make a capital expenditure; (6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar Business; (7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or (8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph (or any combination thereof); provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date. The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess _Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Parent or any Restricted_ Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or other Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture. On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has been entered into), or such earlier time as the Issuers elect, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €68.5 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuers will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuers elect, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of Euro Notes and in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof in the case of Dollar Notes. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any other purpose, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or repurchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro (including the Dollar Notes), such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuers that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below).

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability, cost or expense (including certain legal fees). Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, cost or expense (including reasonable documented legal fees); ----- (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the holders of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee, the Security Agent or any Agent in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including its reasonable documented legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Parent, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Parent. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Parent is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Upon the transfer to a QIB of any Certificated Security initially issued to a Non-Global Purchaser, such Certificated Security will, unless the transferee requests otherwise or the Global Notes have previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated Securities, be exchanged for an interest in the Global Notes.

None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC advised the Issuers that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency”registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. ----- Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Note only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The treatment of the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes is unclear in certain respects due to the absence of authorities that directly address the treatment of debt obligations that have both U.S. and non-U.S. co-obligors. On the Issue Date, a portion of the proceeds of the offering will be borrowed by the US Co-Issuer and the remaining portion of the proceeds of the offering will be borrowed by Parent, and Parent and the US Co-Issuer, as between themselves, intend to treat each of Parent and the US Co-Issuer as primarily liable for a corresponding portion of the obligation to make interest and principal payments on the Notes, and each of Parent and the US Co-Issuer intends to make all interest and principal payments with respect to the portion of the Notes allocable to it. The Issuers will provide the Trustee with information regarding the portion of the Notes allocable to each of Parent and the US Co-Issuer within 90 days after the Issue Date. Holders may obtain this information from the Trustee. Any subsequent changes to such allocation shall promptly be provided to the Trustee. Although the Notes are co-issued by Parent and the US Co-Issuer and, therefore, each Issuer is liable for repayment of the Notes and all interest and Additional Amounts thereon in their entirety, for U.S. federal income tax purposes the Issuers intend, and by acquiring an interest in the Notes each holder of a Note agrees, to treat US Co-Issuereach of Parent and the US Co-Issuer as the issuer of only the portion of the debt borrowed by such Issuer. Parent is treated as an entity that is not regarded as separate from (i.e., is treated as a division of) SCIL UK. As a result, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Parent and the US Co-Issuer intend to treat the portion of each dollar of the principal amount of the Notes allocable to Parent as debt of SCIL UK and the remainder of the principal amount of the Notes as debt of the US Co-Issuer. Assuming such treatment is respected, the portion of the Notes treated as debt of SCIL UK will be debt of a non-U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the portion of the Notes treated as debt of the US Co-Issuer will be debt of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have not received an opinion of counsel regarding the treatment of the Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the treatment of the Notes described above will be respected. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the treatment described above or, that if the IRS were to challenge this treatment, that a court would not agree with the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this treatment, the tax considerations with respect to the ownership and disposition of the Notes would be different from those described below.

A U.S. Holder that holds Euro Notes and that uses the accrual method of accounting may translate accrued interest on such Euro Notes into U.S. dollars at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which the interest accrued (or portion thereof), or, at the U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (i) the last day of the accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles the U.S. Holder’s taxable year, or (iii) the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five days of the end of the accrual period. The election described in the preceding sentence must be consistently applied to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder holding Euro Notes and using the accrual method of accounting will recognize exchange gain or loss (generally subject to tax as ordinary gain or loss) on the receipt of any payments in respect of accrued interest on such Euro Notes (including, upon the sale or other disposition of such Notes, proceeds attributable to accrued interest previously included in income) in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the payment (as determined based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date the payment is received) and (ii) the amount of interest income accrued in respect of the payment. A U.S. Holder may recognize ----- exchange gain or loss (generally subject to tax as ordinary gain or loss) if the interest payment is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt. In general, exchange gain or loss will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Interest on the Notes will generally be treated as non-U.S. source income to the extent treated as debt of SCIL UK for U.S. federal income tax purposes and U.S. source income to the extent treated as debt of the US Co-Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will generally constitute “passive category” income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to generally applicable restrictions and conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement), a U.S. Holder may be entitled to a U.S. foreign tax credit in respect of any non-U.S. income taxes withheld on interest payments on the Notes. Alternatively, the U.S. Holder may deduct such taxes in computing taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that the U.S. Holder does not elect to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for any non-U.S. income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year. The rules governing the U.S. foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the U.S. foreign tax credit in their particular circumstances. Sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of Notes._ A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition (collectively, a “disposition”) of a Note in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such disposition (less any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be subject to tax as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in such U.S. Holder’s gross income) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. If the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder holding such Notes and using the cash method of accounting and, if it so elects, a U.S. Holder holding such Notes and using the accrual method of accounting, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount of euros realized upon a disposition of such Notes by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of such disposition. The election described in the preceding sentence must be consistently applied to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Euro Note will generally be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price of such Note, calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase (or on the settlement date of the purchase in the case of a cash basis taxpayer and also in the case of an electing accrual basis taxpayer if the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market). Except to the extent of any exchange gain or loss (discussed below), gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the Note exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains of individuals and certain other non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will generally be treated as U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. As a consequence, non-U.S. taxes imposed on such gain (if any) may not be creditable against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability under the U.S. foreign tax credit limitations of the Code unless such non-U.S. taxes can be credited (subject to applicable limitations) against U.S. federal income tax due on other income that is treated as derived from non-U.S. sources for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Alternatively, the U.S. Holder may deduct such taxes in computing taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that the U.S. Holder does not elect to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for any non-U.S. income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year. The rules governing the U.S. foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the U.S. foreign tax credit in their particular circumstances. A U.S. Holder will realize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (generally subject to tax as ordinary gain or loss) on the disposition of a Euro Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note on the date of disposition and on the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. Any such exchange gain or loss will be recognized only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on the disposition (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest). A U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss (generally subject to tax as ordinary gain or loss) if disposition proceeds are converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder using the accrual method of accounting that does not make the election described above to determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount of euros realized will recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss with respect to the disposition of Euro Notes to the extent there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and settlement date. In general, exchange gain or loss will be treated as U.S. source gain or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. ----- Tax return disclosure requirement._ Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions (such as the receipt or accrual of interest on, or the disposition of, a Euro Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Euro Note) if such transactions give rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount,. Each U.S. Holder should consult its tax advisor to determine its reporting obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Euro Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). Information with respect to foreign financial assets._ Individual U.S. Holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or $75,000 at any time during the taxable year are generally required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. These reporting requirements also apply to certain entities directly or indirectly owned by individuals that are treated as formed or availed of to hold direct or indirect interests in specified foreign financial assets. The failure to file such information reports could result in penalties and other potentially adverse tax consequences. Notes that are not held in an account maintained by certain financial institution are generally expected to constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the reporting requirements that may be imposed with respect to the ownership of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Unless otherwise indicated, this discussion applies only to holders of Notes that purchase the Notes at the initial issue price indicated on the cover of this Offering Memorandum and that hold the Notes as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment). The discussion below is based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, which may result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. Moreover, there can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this discussion or that a contrary position taken by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not be upheld by a court. This discussion assumes that the Notes will not be issued with more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to investors in light of their particular circumstances, or to investors subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (including, for example, banks or other financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, dealers or traders in securities or currencies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, grantor trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, persons that acquire the Notes as part of a synthetic security, straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons that received the Notes as compensation for the performance of services and certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States). In addition, this summary does not address any aspect of U.S. federal estate and gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any non-U.S., state, or local tax considerations. For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if (x) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions or (y) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A Non-U.S. Holder is any beneficial owner of a Note (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) other than a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. Holder. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its tax advisors as to the tax considerations with respect to an investment in the Notes. ----- PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF OWNING OR DISPOSING OF THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

If the Notes are so categorized, any profit made on disposals (including redemption) of Notes by U.K. Holders, will be taxed as income. If the Notes do not constitute deeply discounted securities, the disposal of the Notes by U.K. Holders may give rise to chargeable gains or allowable losses for the purposes of taxation of capital gains. In calculating any gain or loss on disposal of Notes, sterling values are compared at acquisition and disposal. Accordingly, a taxable profit can arise even where the foreign currency amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the amount paid for the Notes. Transfers of Notes that do not constitute deeply discounted securities by U.K. Holders may give rise to a charge to tax on income in respect of an amount representing interest on the Notes which has accrued since the preceding interest payment date under the provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Any such interest will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, may also be subject to a U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate). Interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder by the US Co-Issuer that does not satisfy the requirements described above will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% or lower applicable treaty rate, provided that the Non-U.S. Holder satisfies certain certification requirements (generally, by providing a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable). It is possible that an applicable withholding agent may treat the entire amount of interest paid on a Note as U.S. source interest subject to the withholding described above (in the absence of any applicable exemption), even if a portion of such interest is paid by Parent and should be treated as foreign source interest in accordance with the intended tax treatment described above under “— Issuers of the Notes for U.S. federal _income tax purposes.”_ Sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of Notes._ A Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to gain realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a Note (except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be subject to tax as described above), unless: (1) the Non-U.S. Holder holds the Note in connection with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so requires, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States); or (2) in the case of an individual, such individual is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year in which gain is realized and certain other conditions are met. A Non-U.S. Holder described in clause (1) above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis and, if it is a foreign corporation, may be subject to a U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate). A Non-U.S. Holder described in clause (2) above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) on the amount by which such non-U.S. Holder’s capital gains allocable to U.S. sources (including gains from the sale, exchange, retirement, or other disposition of Notes) exceed its capital losses allocable to U.S. sources.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,312,TAX CONSIDERATIONS,312.2,UK Tax Considerations,312.2.6,Additional Withholding Rules,"Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly known as FATCA), withholding at a rate of 30% will generally apply with respect to payments of U.S. source interest on Notes held by or through certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) unless such institution (i) enters into, and complies with, an agreement with the IRS to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution that are owned by certain U.S. persons and by certain non-US entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain payments, or (ii) if required under an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, reports such information to its local tax authority, which will exchange such information with the U.S. authorities. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Accordingly, the entity through which the Notes are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Similarly, in certain circumstances, U.S. source interest payments on Notes held by an investor that is a non-financial non-US entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions will generally be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (i) certifies that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners”or (ii) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” which we will in turn provide to the IRS.

They do not purport to be a complete analysis of all U.K. tax considerations relating to the Notes. They do not necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other person. They relate only to the position of persons who hold their Notes as investments (regardless of whether the holder also carries on a trade, profession or vocation through a permanent establishment, branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable) and are the absolute beneficial owners thereof. Certain classes of persons such as dealers, certain professional investors, or persons connected with the Issuers may be subject to special rules and this summary does not apply to such holders of Notes or any holders subject to any other specific tax regime or benefiting from certain reliefs or exemptions. _Withholding_ It is intended that the Parent will be managed and controlled in the UK and therefore will be resident in the UK for tax purposes. While the Notes continue to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 Income Tax Act 2007, payments of interest on the Notes by the Issuers may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of U.K. income tax. The Exchange is currently a “recognised stock exchange” for these purposes. If the Notes cease to be so listed on the “recognised stock exchange”, interest will generally need to be paid by the Issuers after withholding an amount on account of U.K. income tax at the basic rate (currently, 20 per cent.) subject to the availability of any other exemption or reliefs (but, with respect to interest paid by US Co-Issuer, only to the extent such interest has a UK source). For example, where an applicable double taxation treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a beneficial owner of the Notes, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuers and/or the relevant Issuer to pay interest to the relevant holder of the Notes without a deduction for U.K. income tax (or for interest to be paid with a tax deduction at the rate provided for in the relevant double taxation treaty). _Payments in Respect of the Guarantee_ If the Guarantor makes any payments in respect of the Guarantees or otherwise in respect of interest on the Notes (or in respect of other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes), it is possible that such payments may be subject to U.K. withholding tax, subject to any claim which could be made under an applicable double taxation treaty.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.1,General fiduciary matters,107.1.1,,"ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control, conflicts of interest and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. A fiduciary of a Plan should consider the Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment, including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors,” in determining whether an investment in the Notes satisfies these requirements. Each fiduciary of a Covered Plan proposing to invest in any Notes pursuant to this offering should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Covered Plan with respect to the decision to invest in the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes (including any interest therein). All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes in connection with this offering are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes (including any interest in a Note) must be made solely by each prospective Covered Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited transaction issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving “plan assets” of such Covered Plans with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may need to be recinded. For example, the acquisition and/or holding of Notes (including any interest in a note) by an Covered Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,”that potentially may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from a Covered Plan’s investment in a Note. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and ----- Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the Issuers of the Notes nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of a Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any of the above-described exemptions or any other exemption will apply to any or all otherwise prohibited transactions involving a Covered Plan’s investment in the Notes, or that all of the conditions of any such exemptions or any other exemption will be satisfied. Plans and entities that are (or whose assets constitute the assets of) governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), church plans (as defined in section 3(33) of ERISA) that have not made an election under section 410(d) of the Code, and non-United States plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws that include similar requirements. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing any Notes (including any interest in a Note). Because of the foregoing, the Notes (including any interest in a note) should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering an investment in the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be necessary and if so applicable, to the investment in the Notes. Purchasers of the Notes (including any interest in a Note) have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their investment in the Notes complies with the applicable fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. The provision of this offering memorandum and the sale of the Notes (including any interest in a Note) to a Plan is in no respect a recommendation or representation by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan or that such an investment is appropriate or advisable for Plans generally or for any particular Plan.

In particular, the court that rendered the judgment must not have infringed exclusive grounds of jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law and must be reasonably connected with the dispute; (iii) the judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy (orden público) or any mandatory provision and the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in Spain; (iv) the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement of the judgment is accompanied by a translation into Spanish in accordance with article 144 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law; (v) the copy of the judgment presented to the Spanish court has the apostille of the Hague Convention of 1961 validly affixed; (vi) there are no ongoing or pending proceedings between the same parties and relating to the same subject in Spain that were initiated before a Spanish court prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the foreign court; (vii) there are no judgments rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action in Spain or in another country; provided that in this latter case the judgment satisfies the conditions to be enforceable in Spain; (viii)there is no incompatible judgment rendered in Spain, or previously rendered in another country, that meets the requirements to be enforceable in Spain; (ix) none of the parties’ rights of defense were breached (including, but not limited to, proper service of process having been carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its defense and the judgment not having been rendered by default (i.e., without appearance by the defendant or without the possibility for the defendant to appear); (x) to the extent that the party against which the judgment being enforced in Spain has been declared insolvent (declarada en concurso de acreedores), the foreign judgment must comply with the requirements set out in the Spanish Insolvency Law; and ----- (xi) although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the foreign jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained (e.g. the United States) does not enforce judgments issued by Spanish courts on a general basis, then the Spanish courts could be compelled to deny the enforcement of the foreign judgment in Spain. The Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits the Spanish court with competence according to the provisions thereof, from reviewing a foreign judgment on the merits (revisión _sobre el fondo). Also, according to article 3.2 of the Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters,_ the Spanish government may deny cooperation with another state’s authorities if there has been a reiterated refusal to cooperate by that other state’s authorities or a legal prohibition on providing cooperation has been imposed by that other state’s authorities, provided that the Spanish government passes a Royal Decree for such purposes. The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party wishing to obtain Spanish recognition or enforcement of a U.S. ruling that would not be directly recognized or enforced in Spain, must file an application seeking a declaration of the enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish court of first instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or commercial court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil), as the case may be, for which purpose all of the above-mentioned requirements must be met. The competence to hear applications for recognition and authorization for enforcement of foreign judgments in Spain corresponds to the trial courts of the domicile of the party against which the recognition or enforcement is sought, or of the person to whom the effects of the foreign judgment refer to. Subsidiarily, the territorial jurisdiction shall be determined by the place of execution or the place in which the resolution should produce its effects, being competent, in the latter case, the court of first instance before which the application for recognition stands. Once a judgment has been recognized under the exequatur procedure, it will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Law. The enforcement of recognized judgments is time-barred five years after their initial recognition. Spanish courts may express any such enforcement order in a currency other than the euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the Issuers or the Guarantors or may convert such amount into euro on the date of discharge of the judgment (at the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which the amount became due and payable), but in the case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euro in accordance with article 577 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law. Any judgment obtained against the Issuers or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by EU Regulation No 1215/2012 would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms of that regulation. The enforcement of any judgment in Spain includes, among others, the following actions and costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) foreign documents may need to be legalized and apostilled; (c) certain professional fees may arise in order to verify the legal representation of a party litigating in Spain; (d) judicial taxes and/or court fees; (e) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (f) the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts (which could entail additional costs). The rules concerning Spanish civil proceedings are imperative and cannot be amended by mutual agreement between the parties involved. Furthermore, Spain and the United States are signatories to the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965, and, therefore, any notifications and services should comply with the provisions set forth therein. Recognition and enforcement proceedings in Spanish courts may be affected by the emergency measures taken by the Spanish government in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which could be modified from time to time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.6,Enforcement of Judgments in Germany,23.6.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not ----- have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final and conclusive judgment for payment of a specific amount of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. As a general rule, it may be recognized and enforced by a separate action of exequatur by a competent German court in accordance with the proceedings set forth in the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung), generally without review of the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, unless: - the relevant U.S. courts did not have international jurisdiction in accordance with the principles on jurisdictional competence according to German law (e.g. because of a valid jurisdiction clause); - the judgment was given in default of appearance and the defendant invokes such default or that he or she was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings properly or with sufficient time to enable the defendant to arrange for his or her defence; - the judgment is irreconcilable (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany or (iii) the procedure leading to the respective judgment being irreconcilable with a proceeding previously commenced in Germany; - such recognition entails results which are obviously irreconcilable with fundamental principles of German law (ordre public), including without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte); with regard to procedural law, especially violations of the right to a fair hearing may be considered violations of an essential principle of German law; or - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is not guaranteed. Enforcement of and foreclosure based on a final U.S. judgments (res judicata) may be sought against German defendants after having received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. In particular, the remedies need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign judgment became res iudicata, a defence against execution may arise. Although this cannot be excluded on a general basis, it is doubtful whether a German court would assume jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws. However, if an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and the German law that are regarded to as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the relevant Guarantor or such persons will be, basically, regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re- hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States. If however a judgment must be recognized under the German Code of Civil Procedure (see above), a German court has to deliver its judgment in accordance with the findings of the final judgment by a federal or state court of the United States. German courts in the past have denied the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages. They are regarded to be in conflict with fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as the production of evidence, for example, is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior ----- to the trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The “centre of main interests” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation, the “EIR COMI”) is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the EIR COMI of a company or legal person is presumed to be located in the EU member state of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. The European Court of Justice has held that the presumption that a company’s EIR COMI is in the place of its registered office can only be rebutted if factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties (meaning that they are already in the public domain and what a typical third party would learn as a result of dealing with the company, without making specific enquiries) indicate that the company’s EIR COMI is elsewhere (Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/04). Factors which may be taken into account include the location of any regulatory authorities and the places where the company’s business is managed and operated, board meetings are held and the accounts are prepared and audited. The EU Insolvency Regulation specifically states in the Recitals (Recital 30) that the presumption of the EIR COMI being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in a member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other member state. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the EIR COMI, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). ----- Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the presumption cannot be rebutted (Interedil Srl (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil Srl and another C-396/09). If the EIR COMI of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the EU member state within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. Pursuant to Article 7 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the law applicable to insolvency proceedings and their effects shall be that of the EU member state within the territory of which such proceedings are opened. In exception thereto regarding third party’s rights in rem, such as rights securing debt obligations like pledges, assignment of claims or land charges, pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation the opening of insolvency proceedings shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect to both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time, belonging to the debtor, which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Therefore, the EU member state’s jurisdiction governing such right in rem as the law of the place of location continues to apply. Actions for voidness, voidability or unenforceability are not precluded.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

If the EIR COMI of a debtor is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU member state. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its EIR COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s EIR COMI is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective EU member state’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective_ main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another EU member ----- state by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the EU member state in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the EU member state where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its EIR COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s EIR COMI is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Those exceptions include certain ‘safe harbors’ which disapply the lex fori concursus of the relevant proceedings in respect of certain acts and rights. For example, rights in rem (which include the rights of creditors to take enforcement action against, and dispose of, the assets of the company which is subject to the relevant insolvency proceedings) may not be affected by the company’s lex fori concursus and are instead subject to the governing laws which apply to the relevant arrangement under which the creditor obtains such rights. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation is not applicable on third party’s rights in rem if and to the extent rights in rem of third parties or creditors in assets belonging to the debtor exist, which are situated within the territory of a Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings are opened, hence the law in such jurisdictions, the lex fori concursus secondarii, becomes applicable on those rights in rem.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to harmonize the laws and procedures of Member States concerning preventive restructurings and insolvencies, to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the Member States (i.e., minimum harmonization) but, at the same time, leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of several features. The Member States are required to pass national laws to implement the EU Restructuring Directive (except for certain provisions which may be implemented at a later stage) by July 17, 2021. Member States that encounter particular difficulties in implementing this Directive shall be able to benefit from an extension of a maximum of one year of the implementation period subject to certain conditions being met.

Therefore any,314.3.1,Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006,"The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the “Model Law Regulations”) provide that the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) has the force of law in Great Britain, subject to certain modifications. For current purposes, the relevance of the Model Law Regulations is in allowing assistance to be sought in Great Britain by a foreign court or a foreign representative in connection with foreign insolvency proceedings. This may be relevant to the extent that the UK Guarantor have non-UK assets and/or foreign creditors which may be subject to foreign proceedings or to the extent that the Issuers or any of the non-UK Guarantor which may be subject to foreign proceedings have a UK presence. The Model Law Regulations provide for the recognition of two types of foreign insolvency proceedings (defined to be collective judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation): (i) “foreign main proceedings”, which can be opened in the state in which the company has its “centre of main _interests”(which is subject to a rebuttable presumption that the company’s registered office is the center of the_ company’s main interests and it should be noted that the “centre of main interests” for the purposes of the Model Law Regulations may be different from the “centre of main interests” of an entity for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation); and (ii) “foreign non-main proceedings”, which can be opened in the state in which the company possesses an “establishment”(defined as any place of operations where the company carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services). A foreign representative (defined to be a person or body, including one appointed on an interim basis, authorized in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganization or the liquidation of the company’s assets or affairs or to act as a representative of the foreign proceeding) appointed in a foreign main proceeding or foreign non-main proceeding is entitled to apply to commence a proceeding under British insolvency law (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) if the conditions for commencing such a proceeding are otherwise met. A foreign representative may apply to the court for recognition of the foreign proceeding in which the foreign representative has been appointed. From the time of filing of such an application until the time the application is decided upon, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative and where relief is urgently needed to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors, grant relief of a provisional nature. Such relief may include staying execution against the company’s assets, entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder (as defined in the Model Law Regulations) under the law of Great Britain, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “IA86”). Upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities and execution against the company’s assets are stayed and the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company is suspended. Any such stay and suspension does not affect any right to take any steps to enforce security over the company’s property or of a creditor to set off its claim against a claim of the company, ----- provided that such right would have been exercisable if the company had been made the subject of a winding-up order under the IA86. Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or non-main, where necessary to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation, staying the commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, staying execution against the company’s assets, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court, extending relief of a provisional nature previously granted and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder under the law of Great Britain, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the IA86. In addition, upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative has standing to make an application to the court for an order under or in connection with (among others) sections 238, 239, 244, 245 and 423 of the IA86 (see below at “Antecedent Transaction Laws”). For such purpose, certain time periods and notice periods specified in such sections shall be determined by reference to the date of the opening of the foreign proceeding or the date on which a person has notice of the opening of the relevant foreign proceedings as provided in the Model Law Regulations.

The UK Guarantor’s registered office is also located in England and Wales. Therefore any,314.3.2,The Insolvency Test,"The IA86 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the IA86, the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if a creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three weeks to pay, secure or compound the sum to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Amendment of Schedule 10) (among others), no petition for the winding up of a registered company may be presented under section 124 of the IA86 during the period from 1 October 2021 to 1 March 2022 (the “Relevant Period”) on the ground that a “company is unable to pay its debts” without satisfying four conditions. A creditor may not present a petition under section 124 during the Relevant Period for the winding up of a registered company unless (1) the debt is for a liquidated amount which has fallen due for payment and is not an “excluded debt” (defined as a commercial rent debt where the creditor cannot prove that the nonpayment of the debt is not related to the COVID 19 pandemic); (2) the creditor has made a formal request (containing certain prescribed information) to the company seeking proposals for the payment of the debt; (3) the company has not made a proposal that is to the creditor’s satisfaction within 21 days beginning with the day the formal request was delivered; (4) the debt is £10,000 or more, or, where the petition relates to two or more debts, the total amount of all of the debts taken together is £10,000 or more. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England may be initiated in a number of ways and by different parties depending on the process (see below for further detail on each process).",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The UK Guarantor’s registered office is also located in England and Wales. Therefore any,314.3.3,Administration,"A company can enter into administration if the company: (i) is registered under the Companies Act 2006 (“CA 2006”) in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) is incorporated in an EEA State; or (iii) is not incorporated in an EEA State but has its center of main interests (as defined in the IA86) (“COMI”) in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK. There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court followed by a court order for administration (the ‘in-court route’); or (ii) the filing of certain forms with the ----- court following which the administration takes effect (the ‘out-of-court route’). The in-court route is commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its creditors including contingent or prospective creditors and, where applicable, the Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms. A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the IA86 as being a floating charge created by an instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a QFC if that person holds one or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the in-court or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts (see “The Insolvency Test” above). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need to consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective is not reasonably practicable and similarly for the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii) to realize property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see “Statutory order of priorities” below). In order to make an order, the court must be satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the administration will achieve one or more of these purposes. An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration. Additionally, even where no interim moratorium was previously in effect, a company will nevertheless gain the benefit of the moratorium once in administration. The moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process or proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company (creditors cannot enforce their claims against the company to recover debts, for example) and no step can be taken to enforce security over the company’s property, no administrative receiver can be appointed, no resolution can be passed for the winding-up of the company and, except in certain limited circumstances, no order can be made for the winding-up of the company (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court). This moratorium does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”) (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims). During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, an administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security (where powers are more restricted). The permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed charge assets, such permission will only be granted if: (i) disposing of the property in question is likely to promote the administration’s purpose; and (ii) the net proceeds of sale, plus any additional amount required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of property at market value, are applied towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “Antecedent Transaction Laws” below in respect of the latter). An administrator may make distributions to unsecured creditors with permission of the court and in doing so they will follow a statutory order of priority set out in legislation (see “Statutory order of priorities” below). An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and an administrator does not have the power to disclaim contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the ----- best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt—see “Statutory order of priorities” below). Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (including administration) will generally be suspended for the duration of the relevant insolvency procedure (see “Supplier Contracts” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The UK Guarantor’s registered office is also located in England and Wales. Therefore any,314.3.4,Administrative receivership,"Section 72A(1) of the IA86 provides that the holder of a QFC in respect of a company’s property may not appoint an administrative receiver of the company subject to certain exemptions set out in sections 72B to 72GA. Pursuant to section 72B of the IA86, the first exception to this general prohibition is in the context of capital markets. There are three limbs that have to be satisfied in order to qualify for this exception: (i) the appointment is in pursuance of an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement; (ii) a party incurs, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £50 million under the arrangement; and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. Each of the above three limbs is considered further below. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an arrangement is a capital market arrangement if: (i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds a capital market investment issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who issues a capital market investment; or (C) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement in connection with the issue of a capital market investment; or (D) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the arrangement who agrees to provide finance to another party; or (ii) at least one party guarantees the performance of obligations of another party; or (iii) at least one party provides security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another party; or (iv) it involves an investment and described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contracts for differences (the “Regulated Activities Order”). Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the IA86 states that a party to an arrangement includes a party to an agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the arrangement, or is necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. We note that there is no statutory definition or case law on the meaning of the term “arrangement”, however it is clear that an arrangement can be more than just one agreement and in our view the term is apposite to describe a series of inter-related transactions. Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, the requirement to incur debt of at least £50 million may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be expressed wholly or partly in foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at the time when the arrangement is entered into). Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the IA86, an investment is a capital market investment if it: (i) is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or traded or designed to be rated, listed or traded. The Notes meet the criteria to qualify for the capital markets exemption pursuant to section 72B of the IA86. To the extent the Security Trustee is the holder of a QFC, it will be empowered to appoint an administrative receiver. To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a QFC must execute a document appointing an administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document pursuant to which the QFC was created. This appointment document must then be delivered to the proposed administrative receiver and the appointment takes effect upon receipt (provided that the administrative receiver formally accepts the appointment by the end of the next business day). There is no statutory moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the appointment of an administrative receiver. The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the principal and interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed (the “Secured Debt”). An administrative receiver generally has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets which derive from both the security document pursuant to which he or she was ----- appointed and Schedule 1 of the IA86 (except insofar as this is inconsistent with the terms of that security document). In exercising such powers, an administrative receiver acts as agent of the company, unless and until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver can only dispose of assets which are subject to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is satisfied that the disposal (with or without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realisation of the company’s property than would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and any difference between those and the open market value are used to discharge that security. Further, unlike an administrator, an administrative receiver’s powers do not extend to bringing actions against the directors or former directors or (except in very limited circumstances) seeking to set aside certain transactions. Assets coming into the hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less any costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part (as to the meaning of which see “Statutory order of priorities” below). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Therefore any,314.3.5,Fixed charge receivership,"A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges—see “Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute. If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which he or she is appointed, meaning he or she owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the prescribed part and any preferential creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The UK Guarantor’s registered office is also located in England and Wales. Therefore any,314.3.6,Liquidation/Winding-Up,"Liquidation proceedings may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) the debtor’s COMI is in the UK, or (iii) the debtor’s COMI is in an EU member state and there is an establishment in the UK. The English courts can also open compulsory liquidation (see below) in respect of foreign companies as unregistered companies if such foreign company has a sufficient connection to England and Wales. Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realized by the liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see “Statutory order of priorities” below), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”). Compulsory ----- liquidation is a court-based procedure initiated by the presentation of a winding-up petition, commonly but not exclusively on the grounds that the company is unable to pay its debts (see “The Insolvency Test”). Voluntary liquidations are initiated by the company out-of-court. A CVL is initiated by the shareholders but the process involves some degree of control by the creditors. The company may be solvent or insolvent. An MVL is a solvent voluntary liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders and, given that it requires that all creditors are paid in full, no further detail on MVLs is included here. Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever is necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the power to: (i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set aside certain transactions (see “Antecedent Transaction Laws” below in respect of the latter). In a compulsory liquidation, under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the ‘commencement of a winding up’ unless the court orders otherwise (this means that the relevant Issuer loses its ability to service its debt, for example, without the court’s permission). Further, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued against the company or its property except with the permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no such automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, or contributory of the company, order a stay under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86. A liquidator may make distributions to unsecured creditors and in doing so they will also follow the statutory order of priorities (see “Statutory order of priorities”below). The holders of the Notes would receive payment as unsecured creditors alongside other unsecured creditors and based on a proof of debt the trustee of the Notes would submit on behalf of the holders of the Notes (i.e. the holders of the Notes would not receive any (further) interest/coupon payments or any payment on maturity set out in the terms of the Notes themselves). A liquidation does not in itself terminate financial or commercial contracts, but a liquidator does have the power to disclaim onerous contracts and he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt (see “Statutory order of priorities” below). Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms in supplier contracts providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (including liquidation) will generally be suspended for the duration of the relevant insolvency procedure (see “Supplier contracts” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Therefore any,314.3.8,Schemes of arrangement,"Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company is liable to be wound-up under the IA86 (see “Liquidation/Winding-Up” above); and, in the context of a foreign company, requires a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. In practice, the “sufficient connection” test has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Recognition of an English scheme (commenced after December 31, 2020) in an EU member state will, in part, be dependent on that member state’s private internal law rules. Where a contract is English law governed, ----- Regulation (EC) 593/2008 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome I) (“Rome I”) continues to apply following the UK’s exit from the EU. While not historically solely relied on, it is considered possible that the amendments to such English law governed contracts effected by a UK scheme would be recognized in EU member states under Rome I. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If 75% or more by value and over 50% in number of those creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) of each class vote in favor of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Therefore any,314.3.9,Restructuring plan,"Pursuant to Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or arrangement (a “Restructuring Plan”) proposed between a company and its creditors and/or members (or any class of its creditors and/or members) in circumstances where the company has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern. The purpose of the Restructuring Plan must be to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial difficulties. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, the Restructuring Plan procedure is open to any company liable to be wound up under the IA86 (i.e. a foreign company may use the procedure provided that certain conditions are met). For a consensual plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favor) to be capable of being sanctioned by the court, the Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or members in each class present in person or by proxy and voting at each meeting convened to consider the Restructuring Plan (there is no majority by number test as is the case with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also apply to the court to exclude a class from voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company. Unlike a scheme, if the Restructuring Plan is not approved by a number representing at least 75% in value of any class of creditors or members of the company present in person or by proxy and voting at the relevant plan meeting (the “Dissenting Class”), the Dissenting Class may be crammed down provided that: (i) the court is satisfied that no members of the Dissenting Class would be any worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they would be in the most likely alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned (the ‘relevant alternative’); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan is agreed by 75% by value of a class of creditors or (as the case may be) members present in person or by proxy and voting at the relevant plan meeting who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the relevant alternative. Even if the voting threshold is met, the court has discretion as to whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan and will refuse to sanction if it is not ‘just and equitable’ to do so. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it will be binding on all affected parties, including those who did not participate in the vote on the Restructuring Plan and those who voted against the Restructuring Plan.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Pre-moratorium debts are debts due prior to the moratorium coming into force or debts which become due during the moratorium if they relate to obligations incurred before the moratorium comes into force. The moratorium is similar in scope to that which applies in administration, preventing security enforcement and legal proceedings among other things. Like the moratorium which applies in administration, this moratorium does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations. Unlike the moratorium which applies in administration, this moratorium prevents the crystallization of a floating charge. In order to be eligible for the moratorium a company must be or be likely to be unable to pay its debts and the moratorium must be likely to result in the ----- rescue of the company as a going concern. However, there are broad exclusions including for companies which are party to a capital markets arrangement, which will apply in this case once the Notes have been issued.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal (notwithstanding the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents). A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company is eligible to propose a company voluntary arrangement proposal if it is: (a) a company registered under the CA 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland; (b) a company incorporated in an EEA State, or (c) a company not incorporated in an EEA State but having its COMI in a member state other than Denmark. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75 per cent (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, a majority (by value) of the company’s members and no more than 50 per cent (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured.

The UK Guarantor’s registered office is also located in England and Wales. Therefore any,314.3.12,Supplier contracts,"One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is that it can trigger termination or other consequences under supplier contracts. This makes the company vulnerable to ransom creditors. New provisions have been introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 in order to supplement the existing essential supplier regime (see below) to help the continuation of supply of goods and services to companies in an insolvency process. _Essential suppliers_ The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the IA86 (i) prevents the suppliers from, where a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including administration, liquidation and company voluntary arrangements (“CVA”)) and a request is made by or with the concurrence of the insolvency officer holder for the giving, after the date that insolvency procedure commenced or the CVA took effect (as applicable), of any essential supplies, making it a condition of the giving of the supply, or doing anything which has the effect of making it a condition of the giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in respect of a supply given to the company before the effective date are paid; and (ii) where a company enters administration or a CVA takes effect, subject to certain exceptions, compels continued supply by restricting the effect of existing insolvency-related terms in contracts for the supply of essential goods or services. Essential goods and services include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi and chip-and-pin devices. _Other suppliers_ Section 233B of the IA86 says that (subject to certain exceptions), if a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including the new moratorium, CVA, administration and liquidation or where a court order is made summoning a meeting relating to a Restructuring Plan), (i) any provision of a supply contract which provides that the contract or supply would terminate, or any other thing would take place, or that the supplier would be entitled to terminate the contract or the supply or do any other thing (for example, change payment or supply terms) because the company becomes subject to the relevant insolvency procedure, will cease to have effect; (ii) suppliers will be unable to exercise any entitlement arising before the start of the insolvency period to terminate the contract or the supply because of an event occurring before the start of the insolvency period, for the duration of the insolvency period (which in some cases could be measured in years) and (iii) suppliers will be unable to impose ransoms by demanding payment of outstanding amounts in respect of pre-commencement supply as a condition of continuing supply. ----- The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts. Certain contracts involving financial services are excluded from the regime, including a capital market arrangement. In addition, certain types of entities (such as banks or insurance companies), whether such entities are the customer or the supplier, are excluded from this regime. Additionally, the regime does not apply to insolvency-related terms of a contract for the supply of essential goods or services which cease to have effect under section 233A of the IA86 (as described above). Suppliers may still terminate contracts if: (i) they receive consent from the company or insolvency officeholder (where in office); or (ii) the court is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship and grants permission for the termination of the contract. Supplier rights relating to events arising after the insolvency process begins are not affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

This statutory order of priority is broadly summarized as follows (in descending order of priority): (a) proceeds of realizations from assets subject to a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realization); (b) any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver and moratorium debts and certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” in circumstances where a company has entered into a restructuring moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation within 12 weeks beginning with the day after the end of the moratorium; (c) expenses of the liquidation or the administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the administrator or liquidator, or any necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process; (d) ordinary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), which include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person, holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit; (e) secondary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), including bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the statutory limit, deposits made through a non-UK branch of a credit institution that would otherwise have been eligible for FSCS compensation and claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers; (f) subject to certain exceptions, the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money that the administrator or liquidator must set aside from realizations from floating charge assets to distribute to unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations, and unless the cost of making the prescribed part available to unsecured creditors would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors)—calculated as 50% of the first £10,000 of net realizations and 20% of the net realizations thereafter, up to a maximum of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000); (g) proceeds of floating charge asset realizations (less any costs of realization, the preferential debts and the prescribed part), according to the priority of the security; (h) provable debts of unsecured creditors (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings (to pay the secured creditors any unsecured ----- shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the prescribed part unless the prescribed part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors); (i) statutory interest that arises on debts after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum); and (j) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. Any surplus following the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There are no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual set-off arrangements exercised after a company enters liquidation or after the administration insolvency set-off rules apply are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company).",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The UK Guarantor’s registered office is also located in England and Wales. Therefore any,314.3.17,Antecedent Transaction Laws,"There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244). ----- These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which applies regardless of whether the company is in insolvency proceedings. The granting of security or guarantees by a company could be subject to challenge under these provisions. The Issuers cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest by a UK Guarantor and/or any UK Guarantor’s guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Transactions at an undervalue_ If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the “SBEEA”) introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any transaction under section 238 of the IA86. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the Model Law Regulations, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (2 years before the onset of insolvency, being broadly the commencement of its liquidation or administration); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86 (although there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the transaction is made to a person connected to the company such as a shareholder or a director (a “connected person”)). The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the IA86, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such proceedings. _Preferences_ If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. We note that section 118 of the SBEEA introduced section 246ZD to the IA86 from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any preference claim under section 239 of the IA86. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the Model Law Regulations he or she also has standing to bring a preference claim. A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that person would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than that person would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (6 months before the onset of the insolvency or 2 years before the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given. However, for the ----- court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper commercial considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC _Bacon [1990] BCLC 324). Voidable floating charges_ A floating charge created by a company over its property may be invalid if it was created in the relevant time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of 2 years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset on insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. This means that a floating charge can be partly invalid to the extent that it is provided for past consideration. No court action is required save for where there is a foreign officeholder recognised under the Model Law Regulations who wishes to challenge the floating charge under article 23 of the Model Law Regulations. In practical terms, a floating charge will therefore only be invalid to the extent that it is given in exchange for prior consideration (e.g. to secure loans previously made) and any floating charge provided to, among other matters, secure new debt provided at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, will not be invalid under section 245 of the IA86. The requirement for the company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to above, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied in reduction/discharge in debt), the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent. _Transactions defrauding creditors_ A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside by the court if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing that person’s interests in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make. It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder and can be made by, subject to certain conditions, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The victim of the transaction can apply to court himself or herself to set aside a transaction. A foreign officeholder recognized under the Model Law Regulations also has standing to apply to court. The IA86 also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods). The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice. ----- If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Therefore any,314.3.20,Fixed and floating charges,"There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted); (b) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or administrator’s remuneration and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in a winding up or administration are payable out of the charging company’s assets (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to floating charge claims; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to certain additional challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations, floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing of the “prescribed part” for unsecured creditors. This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests. Please note, however, that with prior approval of the court, an administrator may also deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the ----- administration and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document governed by English law as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets or their proceeds in the course of its business without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallisation, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence the ‘prescribed part’ (see “Statutory order of priorities” above). There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail above) following the granting of the guarantee or security.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Failing this, the security created by the security document will be void against a liquidator or administrator and any creditor of the charging company. The application of Chapter A1 to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Regulations. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under Chapter A1 (as set out in section 859A(6) of the CA 2006): (i) a charge in favour of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of the CA 2006 by or under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking Act 2009). Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities. In some cases, such as the registration regime under the CA 2006, the priority of security interests which are registrable and have been duly registered follows chronological order of creation (subject to certain exceptions—see, for example, and without limitation, the exceptions under “Assignments” below). In other cases, priority in respect of security interests over certain types of asset depends on the time at which those security interests are registered in a particular asset register. Thus, for instance, the priority of security interests over ships and aircraft are governed by their respective dates of registration in the appropriate register, whether or not the relevant secured party had notice of an earlier unregistered security interest over the relevant asset.

The scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency (and restructuring) proceedings available in England and Wales, further detail is set out below. To the extent that any of the UK Guarantor has any assets and/or creditors in any overseas jurisdictions and enters into insolvency proceedings in England, recognition of those proceedings in such other jurisdictions is likely to be a relevant consideration. Such recognition would be a matter for the private international law of the relevant jurisdictions. However, insolvency proceedings in relation to the UK Guarantor could also be opened in a country other than England and Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the jurisdiction in which those insolvency proceedings were to be commenced. By way of example, where a debtor has its EIR COMI in a member state of the EU, then (and subject to certain exceptions), insolvency proceedings in relation to that debtor could be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales such proceedings could be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such foreign proceedings would not benefit from automatic recognition in England, although the foreign officeholder could apply under the Model Law Regulations (see below), which provide that foreign insolvency proceedings may be recognized in England where a company has its center of main interest (as that concept is used in the Model Law Regulations) or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets) in such foreign jurisdiction (see—”Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006” below). It is therefore not possible to say with certainty where insolvency proceedings will be brought. _Matters in relation to other Guarantors_ The English courts have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings not only in respect of a debtor that is incorporated in England and Wales (such as the UK Guarantor). The English courts may have jurisdiction ----- to open insolvency proceedings in respect of a foreign (i.e. non UK) entity in relation to specific insolvency proceedings (these are set out more fully below, but by way of example, the English courts may have jurisdiction to place foreign companies into compulsory liquidation as an unregistered company).

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,314,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,314.4,Netherlands,314.4.2,General,"There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities: the first, suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set forth below. Furthermore, as of January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility under a pre-insolvency regime plan to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings as further described below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 00.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non preferential creditors. ----- Under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party pursuant to Article 421a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, the court can order a “cooling down period”(afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred, unless these creditors have the consent of the court to (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the Noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by operation of law. _Bankruptcy_ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. Furthermore, the debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Additionally, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest. There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above). As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 00.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. All unsecured, pre bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the Noteholders may be challenged in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. ----- Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause Noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such renvoi proceedings could also cause payments to the Noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed (gehomologeerd) by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent _Transfer.”_ Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets, will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. _Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans_ The new Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands _akkoord) introduced a procedure for a pre-insolvency restructuring plan that offers an efficient and fairly_ informal process to effect a compulsory composition between the debtor and all or certain of its (secured) creditors or shareholders outside of formal insolvency proceedings. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides inter alia for cross-class cram-down, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto, and supporting court measures. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans entered into force on January 1, 2021. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. The Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting ----- class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period, inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The articles of association of each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantee and security. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company or its administrator in bankruptcy. As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the granting of the Guarantee and security is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that a Dutch Guarantor or the administrator of a Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of a Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such Note, Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor or any security interest provided by a Dutch Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. ----- Likewise, the guarantee or any security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof.

The actio pauliana provisions offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or any security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantee or security interest involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the Guarantee or security rights could be nullified.

If a guarantee or a security interest is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate Benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not expressly defined under Italian law in the applicable legislation and it is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for a downstream guarantee or security interest in respect of financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream guarantee or security interest (i.e., guarantee granted in respect of financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor/ security provider) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee and/or security interest and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of such guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group (without duplication), while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of such guarantee or security interest must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. As a result, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the guarantee or security interest granted by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and downstream guarantees or security interest granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,314,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,314.6,"Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries.",314.6.1,Certain considerations in relation to guarantees and security interests,"_Trust and Parallel Debt_ Under Italian law, the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant security document. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee”as agent or trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. Given the above and considering that the holders of Notes are not party to the security documents governed by Italian law, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the security documents governed by Italian law or cannot enforce that security interest. The Indenture provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt claim and subject to the terms of the Indenture and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its individual capacity acting in its own name and not as agent or representative of the holders of Notes, shall become the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The validity of parallel debt structures under Italian law has, to date, not been considered before the Italian courts and the security interests comprising the parallel debt claim could be held to be in conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the enforceability of a security interest governed by Italian law securing a parallel debt obligation will be upheld by an Italian court and further, no assurance can be provided on how an Italian court would interpret an Italian law security instrument purporting to secure, inter alia, a “parallel debt” obligation. _Undercapitalization._ Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata), will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Moreover, under the current provision of article 2467, first paragraph, of the Italian Civil Code (not yet modified by the amendments envisaged under article 383 of the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019) any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as joint stock companies (società per azioni), hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are joint stock companies (società per azioni). ----- Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a _responsabilità limitata) during the period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from_ the application of the so-called “equitable subordination” rule. The applicability of these extraordinary provisions has not been further extended by the Italian legislator and, therefore, do not apply to any quotaholders loan granted after December 31, 2020. _Certain limitations on enforcement_ The enforcement of security interests and guarantees by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, security interests and guarantees granted by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the security interest or guarantee may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee (as the case may be) and would not be able to recover any amount under the related security or guarantee documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian security provider or guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor or security provider. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interests and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; ----- - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, also taking into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data _certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document_ has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; ----- - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law No. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency”, hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 ----- no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. The Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020. The main provisions set out in the Insolvency Code were expected to come into force 18 months after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale (i.e., on August 15, 2020); the entry into force of Insolvency Code has been originally postponed to September 1, 2021. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the President of the Republic of Italy issued the Law Decree No. 118 of August 24, 2021 (the “Decree 118/2021”)—setting out, inter alia, “urgent measures concerning company crisis and business reorganization, recoveries, as well as further urgent measures on justice”. The Decree 118/2021 must be converted into law within 60 days from the issue thereof; as such, it is still subject to possible amendments (including major ones). Pursuant to the Decree 118/2021, the entry into force of: (a) the Insolvency Code has been postponed to May 16, 2022; and (b) Title II of the First Part of the Insolvency Code (relating to the alert procedures and the assisted crisis resolution procedure before the “OCRI”) has been postponed to December 31, 2023. In addition to the above, the Decree 118/2021 introduced new tools in order to encourage companies to identify viable alternatives to for restructuring or business reorganizations, and in particular: (a) the negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi di impresa); and (b) the simplified composition with creditors proceeding (concordato semplificato) for the liquidation of the assets. In particular, the negotiated crisis composition procedure is a negotiated and out-of-court procedure that will enter into force starting from November 15, 2021 and is aimed at facilitating the recovery of companies which—as specified in the explanatory report to the Decree 118/2021- “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance such as to make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain going concern, including through the sale of the business or a branch of it”. The procedure is initiated by the company by filing an application for the appointment of an independent expert to the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform and the expert is appointed within 5 days of the filing of the request. The expert is responsible for facilitating negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a branch thereof. The procedure does not lead to the opening of a formal insolvency proceeding nor to any dispossession of the company, which remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company, subject to certain conditions. Once a suitable solution to overcome the company’s difficulties has been found, the parties may, alternatively, resort to contractual agreements, or make use of one of the proceedings regulated by the Italian Bankruptcy Law. As mentioned above, the Decree 118/2021 has also introduced the simplified composition with creditors proceeding (concordato semplificato) for the liquidation of the assets. In particular, if the expert, in the final report produced at the end of the negotiated crisis composition procedure, declares that the negotiations have not been successful and that the company has not been able to reach an agreement with his creditors, the exoert may submit, within 60 days of the delivery of the aforesaid final report, a proposal for a simplified composition with creditors proceeding by assignment of assets together with the liquidation plan and other documents indicated by the Decree. Following the submission of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, inter alia, express an opinion on the company’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of the auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing ----- on the list filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court approval (omologazione). Creditors are entitled to object to the court approval within ten days before the date fixed for the hearing. If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the creditors with respect to the alternative of a bankruptcy liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a benefit to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also appoint a liquidator. The liquidation plan may also include an offer by a pre-identified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better solutions on the market, may implement the offer. The provisions relating to the negotiated crisis composition procedure (other than those relating to the establishment of the national electronic platform which has entered into force on August 25, 2021) and the simplified composition with creditors proceeding for the liquidation of the assets will however enter into force on November 15, 2021 (subject to the conversion of the Decree 118/2021 and to any amendment which may be made by the relevant law). Furthermore, by way of the Decree 118/2021 certain provisions of the Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) have been amended and supplemented with effect from August 25, 2021, as better described below. Until the date of entry into force of the provisions of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by Italian Bankruptcy Law, as in force before. Therefore, the main provisions set out in the Insolvency Code are not yet in force and practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot be foreseen. In addition, significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 27, 2015 through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”) which entered into force in June 2015 and has been converted into law by the Italian Law No. 132/2015 (“Law 132/2015”), entered into force on August 21, 2015 (the date after its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale) and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined by Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent and not a temporary status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy tools are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. ----- _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento attestato) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on reorganization plans (piani di risanamento _attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their_ financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth, among the others, by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable; however, it is arguable that they may not be adopted to liquidate and dismiss the business of the company and shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions: (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions (pursuant to Article 217-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent bankruptcy, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the independent expert. _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debts outstanding, subject to the court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court (omologazione), in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due or, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. ----- The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing receivables. Pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (as amended by Article 20 of the Decree 118/2021), in the event of substantial amendments to the plan or the debt restructuring agreement, it is necessary to: (a) update the certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 67(3)(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and renew the consent expressed by creditors consenting to the restructuring agreement, if the amendments occurred before the approval; and (b) publish the renewed certified report (together with the amended restructuring plan) in the companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC), if the amendments occurred after the approval. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. From the date of publication of the petition of moratorium, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions, as well as the acquisition of pre-emption rights (diritti di prelazione), unless agreed upon the parties. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the debtor to supply the creditors with the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium. At such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement and the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for granting such moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can pre-emption rights (diritti di prelazione) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides, in relation to the proceeding for the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt-restructuring agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law already pending as of 23 February 2020, that the debtor which has already been granted such extension by the court, can, before the expiry of the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days even if there is a petition for bankruptcy declaration pending against it. The petition requesting such additional extension shall provide for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. The court, after having obtained the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on real and reasonable grounds (concreti e _giustificati motivi)._ The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame of 60 days, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among other things, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi _di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ Pursuant to Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant ----- category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of nonparticipating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. The Decree 118/2021 has amended the provisions and supplemented Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In particular, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects—which were previously only permitted in relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total indebtedness—can now be applied to any category of creditors. In particular, it is provided that the effects of the debt restructuring agreement may be extended also to non-consenting creditors belonging to the same category, identified on the basis of the similarity of their legal position and economic interests, pro-vided that, inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75% of all the claims belonging to the same category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the amount they would receive in other available alternatives being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. Moreover, if the debtor owes debts to banks and financial intermediaries amounting to not less than half of its total indebtedness, the debt re-structuring agreement with extended effects may be implemented even if it provides for the complete liquidation of the company’s assets. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the nonparticipating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith and (ii) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting financial creditors have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from blocking restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it, through the filing of an objection (opposizione) within 30 days of receipt of the application. The Decree 118/2021 has extended the applicability of standstill agreements previously only available in relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries if such debts represented at least 50% of the total indebtedness. In particular, the new Article 182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides a that the standstill agreement entered into between a company and its creditors, aimed at temporarily regulating the effects of the distress and concerning the deferral of the due dates of the relevant claims, the waiver of the acts or the suspension of the enforcement and precautionary actions and any other measure that does not involve the waiver of the claim, is also effective against non-consenting creditors belonging to the same category, provided that, inter alia: (i) all creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-todate information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the standstill agreement and its effects; (ii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to the same category represent at least 75% of all the claims belonging to the same category; (iii) an expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 67(3)(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been appointed and certifies: (a) the accuracy of the company’s data; (b) the suitability of the agreement to provisionally regulate the effects of the crisis; and (c) that the non-consenting creditors of the same category, to whom the effects of the standstill agreement are extended, will prospectively suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the prospects for resolving the crisis or insolvency that are actually pursued. The provisions regulating this tool will be applicable only to the proceeding for the standstill agreements started after August 25, 2021. In no case may the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement provided for under article 182-octies of the Italian ----- Bankruptcy Law impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter alia, the performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. The continuation of the grant of the use (concessione del godimento) of assets covered by leasing agreements already concluded cannot be considered a new obligation. Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of nonfinancial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. The Decree 118/2021 has also introduced the so called “facilitated debt restructuring agreement”, which represents a particular kind of debt restructuring agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead of the 60% generally required under Article 182-bis, para. 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) provided that the debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for a period of 120 days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary” restructuring agreements); and (ii) has not previously filed a preliminary petition for composition with creditors (the so-called composition with creditors “in bianco”) pursuant to Article 161, para. 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an application for the granting of a standstill period pursuant to Article 182-bis, para. 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) (concordato preventivo) enjoys priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing), unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of the Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount, unless the lender has become a shareholder of the debtor as implementation of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of the Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors). Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy arrangement with creditors procedure described below) (as the case may be) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness via in rem security (garanzie reali) or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financial indebtedness aims to provide a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. It should be noted that, pursuant to Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (as amended by way of Decree 118/2021), in the event of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis initiated following a petition filed after the entry into force of the Decree (i.e. on August 25, 2021).: (A) the debtor may (iii) repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the instalments due under a loan agreement which is secured by a security interest over the assets used in the business, provided that: (a) at the date of the submission of the application for admission to the composition with creditors, the ----- debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorises the payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b) the expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 67(3)(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) that such payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by Article 182-quin-quies, para. 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) and, (ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the repayment of the instalments due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors; (B) the court may authorise payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of the application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose continuation is envisaged under the plan. Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called prededucibile) and urgent indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. Such authorization request can also be filed in relation to the maintaining short-term facilities (linee di credito autoliquidanti) already in place as of the filing date. _Court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (including debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published in the company’s register by the registry of the court. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose claims became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for, inter alia: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The Decree 118/2021, by amending Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, has provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis, the plan may provide for a standstill of up to two years from the date of homologation of the composition with creditors proposal (instead of the previous term of one year) for the payment of secured creditors, except in case of liquidation of the assets or rights on which the security has been created. This provision applies to plans submitted after the entry into force of the Decree (i.e. on August 25, 2021). ----- The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within (a) a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds (giustificati motivi) for such extension; or (b) a 60 days period in the event where a bankruptcy proceeding is pending. Pursuant to the Decree 118/2021, starting from after the entry into force of the Decree (i.e. on August 25, 2021) and until the end of the state emergency (currently set until December 31, 2021), the deadline for filing the plan, the proposal and all the relevant documentation is between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition (subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds (giustificati motivi) for such extension) also in the event where a bankruptcy proceeding is pending. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to oversee the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its nonrecurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the concordato _preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court,_ pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition)pursuant to Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so-called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments, guarantees and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo proposal may provide, inter alia, that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato _con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the plan and the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully_ describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the ----- independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the disposal of those assets that are not functional to the continuation of the business. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente _eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g.,_ employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be treated as a receivable preceding the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo). The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Under the current regime, creditors who have exercised their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest—as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders—to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of the concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their accession is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and when, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in article 161, third paragraph of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to the liquidation alternative. In such case, pursuant to the Decree 118/2021, the accession of the tax authority or the social contribution entities (as the case may be) must occur within 90 days from the filing of the proposal of the debt-restructuring agreement.Article 163 paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings ----- (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors proposal with a liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including the power to take all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer_ for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court must open a competitive bidding process. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree extended by six months the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020. In the procedures for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), that are still pending before the court on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in the course of which a meeting of creditors was already held but for which the majorities according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law were not reached. _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, among other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may enforce the security interests granted in relation to their claims as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any ----- outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor (other than those made through the bankruptcy receiver) after (and in certain cases even before, for a limited period of time) the declaration of bankruptcy, becomes (or could become, if made before) ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition requiring the Court to give the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) a deadline of no more than 60 days scheduled; within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the bankruptcy receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of the creditors and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of the debtor’s assets is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. According to Article 124, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part., to the extent that the plan provides for the satisfaction in proportion to that which is possible in the event of winding-up, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption (causa di prelazione) exists, indicated in the sworn report of a professional meeting the requirements set out in art. 67, third paragraph, letter d) designated by the court. The treatment established for each class may not have the effect of altering the order of the legitimate causes of pre-emption (cause di prelazione). The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. ----- - Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). In particular, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” (super-senior) claims including, inter alia, claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing), claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and the claims for employee wages. Under certain circumstances, claims of preferential creditors might include claims of certain entities and/or financial institutions providing credit support for economic development of companies in the form of, among others, financial guarantees to facilitate companies’ access to credit, due to Italian law provisions providing that, subject to certain conditions and save for certain exceptions, should a guarantee issued by certain guarantee’s providers be enforced by the companies’ direct creditors and the relevant guarantee’s provider exercise its right of subrogation arising therefrom, the claims of such guarantee’s provider towards the company may be given a preference in payment (including in respect of proceeds from enforcement of security interest); applicable Italian law provisions relating to the possible preferential treatment of the abovementioned claims are largely untested in the Italian courts and, therefore, it is uncertain whether and to what extent any priority would be assigned by a court to such claims. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). - Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back”or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of guarantees or security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner. Acts ineffective by operation of law. - Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait that the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and - Under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Acts that may be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner. - The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be ----- declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: - onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; - payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. - The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or the transaction: - payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and - granting of security interest simultaneously created for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. - The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: - payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; - a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; - the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; - transactions entered into and payments made with respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di risanamento attestato; - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security interests granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security granted in the context of an homologated “concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an homologated “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and transactions entered into, and payments made after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo; - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and - payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the ----- third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser. _Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ The extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases, a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submits a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include an arrangement with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from the submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however’ should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. If the Disposal Plan is approved, the extraordinary commissioner(s) can initiate claw-back actions according to the avoidance provisions set forth with respect to bankruptcy proceedings. If acts such as those that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver (see above) are put in place among companies belonging to the same group, the claw-back period is extended to up to three or five years. _Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or granting of a security interests by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees and the granting of a security interests would not amount to a restricted financial activity. ----- _Financial Assistance_ In addition, the granting of a guarantee or of a security interest by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. _Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_ Under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void. _Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_ In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance (as described above), the maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture, the SSRCF Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, the obligations of any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or such guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee and security interest granted by it. As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, among others, financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the SSRCF Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement, as regards to Polynt S.p.A.: (i) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by Polynt S.p.A. will only guarantee and secure the Issuers’ obligations under Tranche A2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, under Tranche B2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Floating Rate Notes and under Tranche C2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes and shall not exceed, in the aggregate at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including the Polynt Proceeds Loan) or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions (capitale e riserve)) advanced from time to time to Polynt S.p.A. (or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuers and/or any of their subsidiaries (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Indenture, the SSRCF Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by Polynt S.p.A., provided that Polynt S.p.A. shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that Polynt S.p.A. is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by Polynt S.p.A. under its Notes Guarantee; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Polynt S.p.A., also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche A2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, of the original principal amount of Tranche B2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Floating Rate Notes and the original principal ----- amount of Tranche C2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche A2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, of Tranche B2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Floating Rate Notes and of Tranche C2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest guaranteed and/or secured by Polynt S.p.A. in respect of any payment obligations under Tranche A2 under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, under Tranche B2 under the Floating Rate Notes and under Tranche C2 of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of (a) with reference to the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the principal amount of Tranche A2 under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes at that time; (b) with reference to the Floating Rate Notes, the principal amount of Tranche B2 under the Floating Rate Notes; and (c) with reference to the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, the principal amount of Tranche C2 under the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes at that time; (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (a) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (b) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations of Polynt S.p.A. under its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and (v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest by Polynt S.p.A. does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/ or payment obligations under Tranche A2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, Tranche B2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Floating Rate Notes and under Tranche C2 (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes. In addition, the above mentioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Floating Rate Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” (or refinancing thereof) in respect of Polynt S.p.A. (as applicable) and, indirectly, its subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuers of the share capital of Polynt S.p.A. and, indirectly, its subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy and/or to repay existing debt originating from previous acquisition schemes and/or otherwise in contravention of any provisions regulating financial assistance. Should the Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral granted by Polynt S.p.A. be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral, as well as any other contract entered into in connection therewith, could be declared null and void. The Notes Documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Notes Guarantee and/or Collateral and/or indemnities granted by Polynt S.p.A., would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code applicable to Polynt S.p.A., this latter will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the relevant Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral shall not be in force and effect ab initio. In any case, the maximum amount that Polynt S.p.A. may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by Polynt S.p.A. will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by Polynt S.p.A. to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor under the Notes and/or pursuant to the SSRCF Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the above mentioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by Polynt S.p.A., the obligations of Polynt S.p.A. as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the SSRCF Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari _passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the_ ----- Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of Polynt S.p.A. shall not exceed at any time, on an aggregate basis the limit of Polynt S.p.A.’s credit support (as applicable) as described above. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed among the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security.

The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt ----- (including those arising from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. Unlike in the Prodi-bis procedure, in the Marzano procedure the extraordinary commissioner(s) can also initiate claw-back actions also if a Recovery Plan is approved, provided that this results in a material benefit for the creditors. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering_ committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Interim financing_ The Decree 83/2015, as amended and converted into law by Law 132/2015, by means of the already described Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among other things, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and that the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. _Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_ Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor enters into insolvency proceedings, any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law as described above. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of a guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Guarantee. In certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective in accordance with the claw-back provisions set forth in the Italian Civil Code as described above.

623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,314,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,314.8,Spain,314.8.1,,"We summarized in this section below certain Spanish legal limitations and considerations that may be relevant to holders as regards the Guarantors incorporated in Spain (the “Spanish Guarantors”). _General enforcement limitations under Spanish law_ The obligations of any Spanish Guarantor under the Guarantees or any security interest granted by a Spanish Guarantor might not necessarily be enforced in accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, given that enforcement is subject to, inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in Spanish courts, the acceptance by that court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of the courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish Law on Civil Procedure (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de _Enjuiciamento Civil) regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under Spanish law, the provisions_ of the Spanish Insolvency Law and other principles of law of general application. In this regard, prospective investors should note and analyze with their own legal advisors any such potential limitations including, without limitation, the following matters: - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Article 1152 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in the event of breach, unless agreed otherwise. Spanish courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be disproportionate according to the bona fide principle). There is doubt as to the enforceability of punitive damages in Spain. - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction other than Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left to the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties. - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being terminated on the basis of breaches of obligations, undertakings or covenants that are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings established in the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements) or that are not deemed significant defaults, and allows Spanish courts to not enforce any such termination. - Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision but that seek a result that is forbidden by, or contrary to, Spanish law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of the law (fraude de ley) and the provisions the application of which was intended to be avoided will apply. - Spanish courts may award damages if specific performance of an obligation is deemed impracticable. - Specific-performance obligations may not automatically transform into a damages claim. - Spanish courts may modify the obligations deriving from contracts according to terms considered necessary in order to restore the balance between the obligations if unexpected and exceptional circumstances arise that were unforeseeable when the contracts were signed. - Under Spanish law, powers of attorney, appointments and authorizations are generally revocable by the grantor (irrespective of whether they are said to be revocable or irrevocable), provided that the revocation is in good faith; however, this general rule would not prevail when the powers of attorney, appointments or authorizations are a necessary consequence of the underlying relationship between the grantor and the beneficiary and such revocation is aimed at frustrating the purpose for which such powers were granted. - In accordance with the general principles of Spanish Civil Procedural laws, the rules of evidence in any judicial proceeding cannot be modified by agreement of the parties. Accordingly, provisions in an agreement in which determinations by a party are to be deemed to be conclusive would not be upheld by a Spanish court. A determination, designation, calculation or certificate from one party as to any matter provided in the secured documents might, in certain circumstances, be held by a Spanish court ----- not to be final, conclusive and binding, if it could be shown to have an unreasonable or arbitrary basis or in the event of manifest error despite any provision in the secured documents to the contrary. - It may not be disregarded that the enforcement of a guarantee or collateral granted by a Spanish Guarantor could require a judgment to be previously rendered in New York declaring the default or acceleration of the secured obligations and the amount due and payable thereunder. - Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred or may be or become subject to the defenses of set-off or counterclaim, abuse of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress or error. - Spanish courts may be affected by preventive emergency measures taken by the Spanish government. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.” _Spanish insolvency regime: general issues_ The Legislative Royal Decree 1/2020, of May 5, approving the (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2020, de 5 de _mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal), which repealed the Act 22/2003 of 9 July,_ on Insolvency (Ley 22/2003, de 9 de julio, Concursal), as amended (the “Spanish Insolvency Law”) regulates pre-insolvency and court insolvency proceedings, as opposed to out-of-court liquidation, which is only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities in full. The insolvency proceedings, which are called concurso de acreedores, are applicable to all persons and legal entities, except for public entities. These proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business or to the liquidation of the assets of the debtor. The insolvency laws of Spain may differ from the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions to which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Spain. The entry into force of Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, implies that Spain will have until July 17, 2022 for the transposition of such Directive into Spanish regulations. The Spanish government is currently working on a draft to amend the Spanish Insolvency Law (which could be approved by the end of 2021 or beginning 2022) to incorporate, among others, certain amendments for the transposition of such Directive and other amendments to the current insolvency regulation which may have a material impact on insolvency and pre-insolvency proceedings in Spain. In addition, due to the health crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared a State of Alarm (Estado de Alarma) in Spain from March 14 to June 8, 2020 (which was subsequently re-instated until May 9, 2021) and, from that date, the Spanish Government has enacted certain legislation that temporarily amend certain provisions of the Spanish insolvency regime, as further described below. Moreover, future changes, amendments or restatements of the Spanish Insolvency Law cannot be disregarded either. _Concept and petition of insolvency_ Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is considered insolvent when (i) it cannot comply with its due and payable obligations on a regular basis (insolvencia actual) or (ii) when it expects that it will shortly be unable to do so (insolvencia inminente). A debtor must file for insolvency within two months of the date when that petitioner becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its actual insolvency (unless the company has made a pre-insolvency filing in accordance with Article 583 et. seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law). This legal duty to file for insolvency has been legally suspended until December 31, 2021 (even if a pre-insolvency notice was filed) so the two-month period for filing for insolvency will start from then. On the contrary, the debtor is not legally obliged to file for insolvency when its insolvency is imminent. Indeed, the general duty to file for insolvency within the abovementioned two-month period does not apply if the debtor who is in actual or imminent insolvency and has not been declared to be in insolvency notifies the applicable court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support to reach a pre-packaged Company Voluntary Arrangement or “CVA”(propuesta de convenio anticipado), or a refinancing agreement in accordance with Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the “Pre-insolvency Filing”). After filing, the debtor is not entitled to file another Preinsolvency Filing for one year. ----- In effect, by means of the Pre-insolvency Filing, the debtor gains an additional (starting from the Pre-insolvency Filing) three-month period to reach a refinancing agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to a pre-packaged CVA and one further month to file for the declaration of insolvency in the event it has not been removed. During that three-month period, creditors’ petitions for mandatory insolvency will not be accepted (a petition for insolvency potentially filed by a creditor within the next month will not be processed by the court unless the debtor does not file for insolvency by the end of that month) and court or out-of-court enforcement actions, other than those arising from public law claims, over those assets or rights deemed necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business activities are prohibited or suspended (as applicable). In addition, enforcement proceedings that have been brought by creditors holding financial liabilities (as defined in Article 606 of the Spanish Insolvency Law) are prohibited or suspended (as applicable) during that three-month period provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to enter into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement proceedings against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating. Nevertheless, secured creditors are entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the corresponding secured assets, although once proceedings have been initiated they shall be immediately suspended for the abovementioned three-month period. Financial collateral (garantías _financieras) should not be affected by the effects of the Pre-insolvency Filing. The effect of the Pre-insolvency_ Filing on security interests over collateral located outside of Spain will depend on the applicable international private law. For instance, foreclosure of security interests located in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) will not be affected by the Pre-insolvency Filing, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation. The Pre-insolvency Filing cannot imply acceleration of deferred creditors on a standalone basis. Creditors are entitled to trigger a third-party personal guarantee to request repayment of a due and payable debt, although the debtor has filed the Pre-insolvency Filing, even if that creditor is taking part in the negotiations protected by the Pre-insolvency Filing. A debtor may also file for insolvency when it expects that it will be unable to comply with its due obligations in a regular and timely manner (insolvencia inminente). In addition, under certain circumstances established in the Spanish Insolvency Law, the declaration of insolvency of a debtor may be requested by any creditor thereof (creditors’ petitions for the debtor’s insolvency filed since March 14, 2020 shall be not admitted for process until December 31, 2021). If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed “voluntary” (concurso voluntario) and, if filed by a third party, the insolvency is deemed “mandatory”(concurso necesario). The petition for a declaration of insolvency must be filed with the commercial court of the province where the debtor has its “center of main interests”in Spain. The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the court will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and, in turn, whether the debtor has challenged the petition made by the creditor or certain grounds alleged by the creditor in order to file for the debtor’s insolvency), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on a timely basis and is complete, and the workload of the court. Upon the declaration of the debtor’s insolvency, the court will appoint one insolvency administrator, although sometimes a second insolvency administrator can also be appointed if it is in the public interest to do so. _Request of coordinated insolvency_ Creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of their debtors if either (i) there is confusion as to the ownership of their respective assets, or (ii) they form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, a request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves, provided that they form part of the same group. Any of the insolvent debtors, or any of the appointed insolvency administrators, as the case may be, may under certain circumstances (in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of companies) apply for the joinder of insolvency proceedings that have already been declared. In addition, creditors may apply for the joinder of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of their debtors that have already been declared if either (i) there is a confusion as to the ownership of their respective assets, (ii) they form part of the same group of companies, or (iii) they are managers, shareholders, partners or members personally liable for the debts of the debtor if it is a legal entity; provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrators. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in a coordinated manner, without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, “group insolvency”does not lead to commingling of the debtors’ assets and the creditors of the group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where ----- cross guarantees exist). The current system is basically a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost-efficient as possible, as well as allowing for approval of the composition agreements hypothetically submitted to be reciprocally conditioned on the approval of the others. However, exceptionally, assets and liabilities among the companies declared insolvent may be consolidated where there is confusion of estates, and the assets and liabilities belonging to each of the companies cannot be identified without incurring unjustified costs or delays. The Spanish Insolvency Law establishes a single insolvency procedure (concurso), applied to any insolvent debtor, which includes a common phase (during which, among other things, insolvency administrators are appointed, an inventory of the assets and a list of creditors are prepared and subject to challenge and claims are ranked) and two potential results: (i) a composition agreement between the creditors and the debtor (“CVA”), or (ii) the debtor’s liquidation. _Certain effects of insolvency Effects for the debtor_ In the case of voluntary insolvency, as a general rule, unless the court decides otherwise, the debtor retains the management and powers of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention of the insolvency administrator, who consequently must approve any management or disposal decision. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, unless the court decides otherwise, the debtor’s management powers are suspended and management’s former powers, including the power to dispose of assets, are conferred solely upon the insolvency administrator (sustitución). This notwithstanding, as a general rule, any sale or encumbrance of the debtor’s assets or rights before the approval of a CVA or the opening of the liquidation phase requires specific authorization from the court. There are certain exceptions to this rule including transactions in the ordinary course of business, or transactions essential to ensuring the viability of the company or its treasury needs required by the continuation of the insolvency. _Effects on contracts_ One of the main general principles underlying the Spanish insolvency regime is that of “no termination effect” or continuity of all contracts to which the insolvent debtor is party. In accordance with Articles 156-158 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, all clauses in contracts that allow any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s insolvency declaration (ipso facto clauses) are deemed as not included in the agreement and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e. agency laws or Royal Decree Law 5/2005, applicable to financial collateral, as defined therein). Any provision to the contrary will be null and void. Insolvency declaration does not hinder the effectiveness of contracts with reciprocal obligations pending on performance by both the insolvent party and the counterparty (“executory contracts”), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate (administrative expense—post-insolvency credits that are pre-deductible from the debtor’s estate—créditos _contra la masa, as further explained below)._ However, upon post- petition breaches, the Insolvency Court can terminate any such contracts at the request of the non-breaching party of the agreement or declare the continuation of the executory contract based on the “insolvency proceeding´s best interest” (mantenimiento del contrato en interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party’s claim will be considered as a post-insolvency credit (pre-deductible from the debtor’s estate, créditos contra la masa). Pre-petition breaches leads to the termination of the executory contract only if the executory contract is a continuing one (tracto sucesivo). On the other hand, the Insolvency Administrator (together with the insolvent debtor or by its sole discretion if debtor’s powers to manage and dispose of its business have been conferred to the Insolvency Administrator) may request the Insolvency Court to early terminate the executory contract in the interest of the insolvent debtor’s estate (resolución del contrato en interés del concurso), even if no breach exists. The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return and indemnify damages to its counterpart against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). In the event that debtor, the Insolvency Administrator and the counterparty agree on the termination and its effects, the Insolvency Court will approve the parties’ agreement; otherwise, if the Insolvency Court upholds termination, it will also fix the damages claim to be received by the counterpart. ----- Furthermore, insolvency declaration stays the accrual of interest amounts under the relevant agreements, except for: (i) credit rights secured with an in rem right, in which case non-moratorium interest accrues up to thevalue of the security interest as such value is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law (i.e. 90% of the collateral fair value minus senior claims), and (ii) any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the Act of the State Budget (Ley de _Presupuestos del Estado) in force at that time. As a general rule, set-off is prohibited unless (i) the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency (even if the set-off is alleged afterwards, or the creditor communicated the existence of the claim to the insolvency administrator); or (ii) the claims and debts arise from the same legal relationship. Where there are claims subject to laws other than Spanish laws, other rules may apply. Effects on enforcement proceedings_ As a general rule, the initiation of insolvency proceedings stays enforcement actions. In particular, the enforcement of any in rem security interest over those assets or rights that are deemed by the Insolvency Court as necessary to the continuation of the debtor’s commercial or professional activity, or to a business unit of the insolvent company, cannot be commenced (and the procedures already initiated before the insolvency declaration shall be suspended) until the earlier of: (i) approval of a Reorganization Plan or Convenio provided that such Reorganization Plan does not affect such right; or (ii) one (1) year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without the liquidation phase under the insolvency proceedings being initiated. This stay of enforcement proceedings will only be lifted when the Insolvency Court determines that the assets or rights are not considered necessary for the debtor to continue its professional or business activities, or when any of the aforementioned scenarios occur. When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, Spanish courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights. Nevertheless, shares (either acciones or participaciones sociales) held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares does not bring about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset. The above regime should not affect financial collateral provided under RDL 5/2005 (the Spanish law implementing the EU Financial Collateral Directive), which should still be enforceable, or where the collateral is located outside of Spain by the time of insolvency declaration if the effects of the insolvency over such collateral are to be governed by the insolvency law of the state where the collateral is located. However, application may be made to the court for precautionary measures preventing the enforcement of any such collateral. Pursuant to Articles 44, 52 et seq. and 142 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, in order to protect the interests of debtor and creditors, the jurisdiction of the court for the insolvency proceedings is extended to include any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). Moreover, as a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings that can have an effect on the estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral, as defined in RDL 5/2005). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the Insolvency Court, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law). Finally, prospective investors should also note that enforcement of any security interests will be subject to the provisions of Spanish Civil Procedure Act and Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable), which may entail delays in the enforcement. _Effects on secured assets_ The secured assets can be sold by the Insolvency Administrator during the insolvency proceedings to a third-party or to the creditor that holds the specially privileged debt that is secured by such asset, in each case, ----- subject to certain conditions. The secured assets might be sold either with the security or free of any security, by applying the sale proceeds (in the proportion allocated to the secured assets) towards the payment of special privileged debts, in certain instances subject to the consent of the specially privileged creditor. In the context of the sale of business units that include secured assets, the consent of specially privileged creditors is not required when the security is not released and the buyer is subrogated in the debtor’s position. In the event that the sale proceeds that are applied towards the satisfaction of the special privileged debt are less than the value of the security, the consent of specially privileged creditors with collateral included within the business unit sale is required. The 75% threshold of the specially privileged debts affected by the sale can cramdown any holdouts. _Hardening periods_ There is no automatic claw-back date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Instead, the insolvency administrator must expressly challenge those transactions, to the extent they were detrimental to the debtor’s estate and were executed during the two years before the insolvency is declared. In addition, creditors who have applied to exercise any claw-back action (stating the specific action they aim to contest or revoke and the grounds of their petition) shall be entitled to exercise that action if the insolvency administrator does not do so within the two months following their request. Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, upon a declaration of insolvency, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the debtor’s estate carried out by the debtor during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded, even in the absence of fraudulent intent or a link to the insolvency (transactions taking place earlier than two years before the declaration of insolvency may be challenged under the general applicable regime, under which fraud is required, among other things). The Spanish Insolvency Act does not define the meaning of detrimental (perjuicio patrimonial). Detrimental does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest resulting in the damage to the insolvent debtor’s estate so that, according to the Spanish Supreme Court, an unjustified sacrifice to the debtor’s estate has been caused. Article 227 of the Spanish Insolvency Law contains an irrefutable presumption that those acts where no consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts that result in the early repayment or settlement of obligations which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations were secured by means of an in rem security) are detrimental. In addition, pursuant to Article 228 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, unless the debtor or another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the court’s satisfaction, a disposal made in favor of “specially related parties”(as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) as well as the creation of a security interest securing a pre-existing obligation or a new obligation that replaces an existing one, and those payments or other acts extinguishing obligations that would have become due after the declaration of insolvency and which are secured by means of an in rem security, are presumed to be detrimental. In the case of acts not covered by the above presumptions, the burden of proof is on the person bringing the claw-back action, who consequently must prove the detriment to the debtor’s estate. Acts deriving from the debtor’s ordinary course of business made at arm’s length and certain refinancing arrangements (acuerdos _de refinanciación) meeting the legal requirements set out in Articles 697 and following of the Spanish_ Insolvency Law, as well as the acts and payments made and the security created in connection therewith, may not be rescinded in the event of a subsequent insolvency (concurso consecutivo), as provided in the abovementioned articles. Accordingly, the debtor’s acts of disposal with “specially related parties”, as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law, including intragroup guarantees or securities, are presumed to be detrimental unless proved otherwise. If the action for rescission against a transaction of a bilateral nature is successful, reciprocal restitution of the consideration will be ordered, along with any proceeds and interest accrued. When it is no longer possible to return the item received, the cash equivalent of its value at the time it left the debtor’s estate, plus interest, must be delivered. The obligation arising from the action for restoration is considered a credit against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) so that the counterparty to the debtor will settle that credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate, unless the third party is held to have acted in bad faith, in which case the credit due to the restoration will be considered as subordinate ----- and the liable party must indemnify the debtor for losses and damage suffered. When the transaction subject to claw back is of a unilateral nature, the judge will order the restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction and the inclusion of the relevant counterparty claim in the list of creditors, with the relevant ranking according to its nature unless the creditor is deemed to be in bad faith, such that its claim will be classified as subordinated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be subject to claw-back actions if the act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means and under any grounds whatsoever (i.e. not only in insolvency scenarios) under the relevant non-Spanish applicable laws. _Ranking of credits_ The current Spanish Insolvency Law distinguishes between insolvency claims (créditos concursales) and claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa). - Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa): Article 242 of the Spanish Insolvency Law provides for the so-called “estate claims” (créditos contra la masa) which main feature is that these are pre-deductible (i.e. when they become due and payable) claims from the insolvent debtor’s estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security). Debt against the insolvent debtor’s estate includes, among others: (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) certain costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) claims that arise after the declaration of insolvency due to the continuation of the debtor’s business activities, (iv) payments arising from agreements with outstanding reciprocal obligations surviving after the declaration of insolvency, and amounts due as a result of its termination, (v) claims arising in favor of a creditor subject to a claw-back action (except if the creditor acted in bad faith), (vi) claims arising from obligations lawfully undertaken by the debtor with the approval of the insolvency administrators or by the insolvency administrators during the insolvency proceedings, (vii) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the non-contractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (viii) in the event of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a CVA to finance the viability plan required to comply with the CVA in accordance with Article 332.2 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, except for new funds granted by the debtor or by persons specially related to the debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose (unless in the event of default of a CVA approved or modified in the two years subsequent to March 14, 2020, as long as the CVA has identified the obliged party and the maximum amount of the financing to be granted or the guarantee to be perfected, so that the funds provided by the specially related person shall be consequently classified as claims against the insolvency estate), and (ix) 50% of the new funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law that is not subject to claw back (except for new funds granted by the debtor or by persons specially related to the debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose). As a general rule, claims against the insolvency estate are payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before general debts in insolvency proceedings), unless the debtor’s estate is not sufficient to do so, applying in such cases specific ranking rules. Enforcement of claims against the insolvency estate can be commenced only when a CVA comes into force. Assets subject to special privilege cannot be affected by the payment of debts against the insolvency estate. - Insolvency claims (créditos concursales): Creditors are required to report their insolvency claims to the insolvency administrator within one month of the publication of the court order declaring the insolvency in the Official State Gazette, providing documentation to justify such claims. Based upon the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classifies them according to the categories established in the Spanish Insolvency Law: - Creditors benefiting from special privileges; in particular, with claims secured by a specific asset or right (essentially, in rem security). The scope of the privilege is established by reference to the value of the collateral as determined pursuant to the rules of the Spanish Insolvency Law (which, in turn, is calculated by reference to the fair value of the collateral). Thus, an objective distinction is being made between the portion of the debt that is really covered by the value of the collateral and the portion that is not. The portion of the debt not covered by the value of the collateral is given the same treatment as unsecured claims and will be classified according to its nature. The value of the in rem security will be that resulting from deducting—from nine tenths of the fair value of the asset or right over which the security lies—any outstanding debts enjoying a preferential security over the same asset. The value ----- cannot be less than zero or greater than the value of the privileged claim or the value of the maximum mortgage or pledge liability that might have been agreed. Fair value means: (i) for listed securities, the average weighted price at which they would have been traded on one or more regulated markets in the last quarter before the date of the declaration of insolvency, according to the certificate issued by the company governing the market in question; (ii) for real estate assets, that resulting from the appraisal report issued by an officially approved entity; and (iii) for other assets, that resulting from the report issued by an independent expert in accordance with the valuation principles and rules generally recognized for these assets. The reports established for the latter two cases will not be necessary when the value has been determined by an independent expert within six months before the date of the declaration of insolvency, or when the assets are cash, current credit accounts, electronic money or fixed term deposits. These creditors may under certain circumstances initiate separate enforcement proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions, including a waiting period that may last up to one year, as well as to specific additional limitations in cases of sale and repayment set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law, depending on whether the secured asset is sold on an individual basis or as part of a business unit of a going concern, as provided in Articles 209 and following of the Spanish Insolvency Law. The insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the securities provided that they pay the respective claim up to the value of the collateral. Specially privileged creditors are not subject to the CVA, except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the agreement or they are crammed down to the extent certain majority approval thresholds are reached, even though the respective creditors are in opposition. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment with proceeds obtained from the assets that secure their claim. - Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among others, specific labor claims up to a certain amount; claims for amounts relating to unpaid withholding taxes and social security contributions; claims for other amounts to be paid to the tax authorities and the social security authorities for half (50%) of their amount; claims held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent the application has been approved, for up to half (50%) of the amount of the claim; and new funds lent under a refinancing agreement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law not subject to claw back in the amount not admitted as a claim against the insolvency estate (except for new funds granted by the debtor or by persons specially related to the debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose). The holders of general privileges are not affected by a CVA if they do not vote in favor of the agreement or they are crammed down to the extent certain majority approval thresholds are reached, even though the respective creditors are in opposition. However, some specific content of the CVA cannot be imposed on dissenting public or labor claims. In the event of liquidation, claims benefiting from a special privilege are paid before ordinary claims, in accordance with the ranking established under the Spanish Insolvency Law. Assets subject to a special privilege may not be used to pay general privilege claims, unless there is an excess after the payment of the secured claim. - Special and general privileged creditors must also be classified into one of the following classes: labor, public, financial and the remaining creditors. This classification is relevant to determine the majorities to approve a CVA and extend them to dissenting privileged creditors of the same class, as well as in the event of sales of the collateral as part of a business unit of a going concern. - Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) rank pari passu and will be paid pro rata. - Subordinated creditors (those subordinated to all ordinary creditors by virtue of an agreement or pursuant to law), include, among others, those with certain claims communicated late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned above); claims that are contractually subordinated vis à vis all other credits of the debtor including profit participating loans; claims relating to surcharge and unpaid interest claims (including default interest) except for those claims secured with an in rem right up to the secured amount; fines; claims held by creditors that are “specially related parties” to the insolvent debtor; claims resulting from acts that were clawed back where the creditor was declared in the judgment to have acted in bad faith; and certain claims deriving from contracts with reciprocal obligations if the creditor attempts to prevent the fulfillment of the contract to the detriment of the insolvency interests. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors; they do not have the right to vote at the creditors’ meeting (through which the CVA is approved or rejected) but are bound by the CVA, if approved, and are paid last, according to the ranking established by Spanish Insolvency Law. Moreover, securities granted to secure a subordinate claim shall be canceled. ----- In the case of legal entity debtors, the following shall be deemed to be “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in the event such shareholders are natural persons then this would include any specially related party to these shareholders, as legally described); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the debtor is listed) by the time the credit right arises; (iii) directors (including shadow directors), liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company, as well as individuals holding such positions within the two years prior to the declaration of insolvency; and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and any common shareholders with the legal entity in insolvency and any other company of the group provided such common shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law or a CVA (even if those creditors have assumed a position on the board of directors of the debtor on account of the capitalization) shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such arrangements. Additionally, those creditors executing a collective refinancing agreement, or a CVA, will not be deemed as shadow directors as a result of the covenants assumed by the debtor in relation to the viability plan, unless the existence of a circumstance justifying the shadow directorship is proven. In addition, there is a rebuttable presumption, established in the Spanish Insolvency Law, that the assignees of the above are also “specially related persons” if the assignment has occurred within the two years prior to the declaration of insolvency. Lastly, claims different from loans and acts with an analogous purpose held by shareholders and common shareholders will not be subordinated. The Spanish temporary coronavirus pandemic regulations establish that, as regards insolvency proceedings declared until March 14, 2022, new money provided since the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain (i.e. March 14, 2020) by specially related persons and any claims in which such specially related persons are subrogated after that date due to a payment of debts on behalf of the debtor will be considered ordinary claims, thus not being subordinated, regardless of the privileges that could exist. As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in Royal Decree Law 5/2005 of 11 March 2005, as amended from time to time), or collateral located in an EU Member State other than Spain, or labour and administrative enforcement proceedings in certain circumstances). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, as a general rule, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with the insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets. Moreover, the effects of insolvency proceedings on a creditor’s in rem rights attached to property or rights—of any kind—of the debt or which, at the time of the declaration of the insolvency proceedings, are located in a state (other than a EU Member State bound by the EU Insolvency Regulation) must be exclusively governed by the law of that state. Lastly, under certain circumstances, directors (including shadow directors), liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney may be held liable for the payment of the claims that cannot be paid with the debtor’s assets upon its liquidation if a court determines that the insolvency was generated or aggravated due to their willful misconduct or gross negligence (concurso culpable). For such purposes, certain rebuttable and non-rebuttable presumptions are established by the Spanish Insolvency Law. _Spanish Refinancing Agreements_ The Spanish Insolvency Law excludes certain types of refinancing agreements from the scope of clawback actions, including the guarantees and security interests granted in execution of such agreements. There are two types of refinancing agreements that are ring fenced against claw-back actions: (i) Collective refinancing agreements are agreements entered into by a debtor who is in a state of actual or imminent insolvency and has not been declared in insolvency by a court that provide for a significant increase of the credit available to the debtor or the modification of the obligations of the debtor under the original financing agreement, either by means of a payment deferral or by setting out new obligations in substitution of prior ones provided that, in addition, the following conditions are met: (a) the agreement is entered into by creditors holding claims amounting to at least 3/5 of the debtor’s debt on the date of execution of the refinancing agreement (in the case of a group of companies, this majority must be reached both on a consolidated and individual basis, excluding intragroup claims); (b) the 3/5 amount referred to in (a) is confirmed in a certificate issued by the auditor of the debtor (in the event it does not have one, the Commercial Registry will appoint one); and (c) the agreement must be formalized in a public deed. Refinancing agreements must be executed in the context of a viability plan designed to allow debtors to carry on their business activities ----- in the short and medium term. In the event the pre-insolvency notice has been filed, the execution of the refinancing agreement must take place within a three- month period; and (ii) Non-collective refinancing agreements are those agreements entered into by a debtor who is in a state of actual or imminent insolvency complying with the requirements set forth in Article 604 of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Neither refinancing agreements, homologated as described below but also not homologated when complying with the legal requirements, nor those acts, transactions and payments executed in compliance with the refinancing agreement, irrespective of its nature and legal form, nor any security or guarantee perfected in accordance with those, may be subject to claw-back or rescission actions in the event of a subsequent insolvency (concurso consecutivo) declared pursuant to Articles 695 and following of the Spanish Insolvency Law. On the contrary, if the refinancing agreement is declared null in the event of a subsequent insolvency, acts detrimental to the debtor’s estate carried out by the debtor in the two years preceding the declaration of insolvency, as well as those carried out when complying with the refinancing agreement, may be subject to claw back or rescission. Additionally, in the event of a subsequent insolvency, any act carried out by the debtor before the declaration of insolvency, as well as those carried out when complying with the refinancing agreement, are subject to all challenging actions other than the claw-back action as are generally allowed by law, which should be brought by the insolvency administrator exclusively. Refinancing agreements satisfying the requirements referred to in (i) above (except for the majority referred to in (a)) may be also homologated (homologado) by the insolvency court if (i) they have been subscribed by creditors holding at least 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision at the date of the refinancing agreement (that is to say the Spanish Insolvency Law excludes public creditors, labor creditors and creditors of commercial transactions); (ii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the 51% majority referred to above has been reached; and (iii) the agreement is formalized in a public deed. Additionally, adhesions to the refinancing agreement by creditors not holding financial claims are not included in the calculation, as well as claims held by creditors who are “specially related to the debtor”, although these claims are affected by the approval of the refinancing agreement. Claims not represented in euros will be converted according to the official exchange rate as at the date of the public deed formalizing the refinancing agreement. If part of the liabilities include syndicated loans, all creditors holding an interest in the syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably voted for by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. The scope of this measure is not clear among Spanish scholars and the courts and therefore it is not yet possible to ascertain what its practical effects will be. Specially preferred creditors who are bound by the homologated refinancing arrangement (because they supported it or because its effects were extended to them) may start or resume separate enforcement of their collateral upon a court declaration of a breach of the arrangement (which will imply termination of the refinancing agreement and the ceasing of its effects on the financial claims), in which case they will keep the amount obtained by enforcement to the extent of the original debt, and any excess will be added to the insolvency estate. Enforcement cannot be brought if the homologated refinancing agreement provides, in the event of default, for the extinction of either the pre-existing security interests or the ones perfected under the refinancing agreement. Default claims filed between January 30 and September 30, 2021 will not be admitted until October 30, 2021, so the debtor can communicate within that month its intention to negotiate an amendment or replacement of the refinancing agreement, such that it may have three additional months until the default claim is admitted for process. The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting or non-participating unsecured creditors holding financial claims; or (ii) secured creditors to the extent that that part of their secured financial claim is not covered by their security interest, as valued in accordance with the rules set out by the Spanish Insolvency Law: (a) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities, the maturity of the creditor’s claims may be extended by up to five years or the debt converted into so-called profit participating loans (préstamos participativos) with a five-year maturity. Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured financial claims covered by the security interest of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by creditors holding secured claims covered by the security interest that represent 65% of the covered amount of the value of the secured claims covered by the security interest held by all the creditors holding financial liabilities. ----- (b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities: (i) maturity extensions for up to 10 years; (ii) haircuts (note that a cap has not been established); (iii) capitalization of debt (nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing agreement -either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it- may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or (ii) a haircut of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap); (iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to 10 years, convertible obligations, subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and (v) assignment of assets or rights in or for total or partial payment of the debt. Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured financial claims covered by the security interest of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by creditors holding secured financial claims covered by the security interest which represent at least 80% of the value of the secured financial claims covered by the security interests held by all the creditors holding financial liabilities. _CVA regime_ A similar regime than that of the homologated refinancing agreements explained above applies to the CVA. The proposals in the CVA shall include a payment schedule as well as a viability plan, and shall be filed and voted in the moment and manner determined by the Spanish Insolvency Law. The majorities applicable to the CVA depend on the kind of measures included in the CVA proposal to be voted on: (i) a simple majority is required for (i) the full payment of ordinary claims with an extension not exceeding three years, or (ii) the prompt payment of ordinary claims but with haircuts not exceeding 20%; (ii) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 50% of ordinary claims is required for: (i) haircuts not exceeding 50%; (ii) extensions, of principal, interest or any other amount due, for a period not exceeding five years; or (iii) the conversion of claims into profit participating loans (préstamos participativos), excluding “public” and “labour” creditors, for a period not exceeding five years; and (iii) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 65% of ordinary claims is required for a CVA providing for any other content among those allowed by the Spanish Insolvency Law (for instance, (i) haircuts exceeding 50%; (ii) extensions, either of principal, interest or any other amount due, for a period between five and ten years; (iii) the conversion of claims into profit participating loans (préstamos participativos), excluding “public” and “labour” creditors, for a period between five and ten years; (iv) debt for assets deals in relation to some assets and under certain circumstances, or (v) proposals for allocation of the debtor’s business on a going concern to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity for the minimum period of time provided in the CVA and to pay off, totally or partially, the debt as established in the CVA). For the purposes of the majorities, ordinary claims also include those special and general privileged claims voting in favor to the CVA. The holders of subordinated credits, as well as creditors considered as specially related to the debtor who purchased claims after the declaration of insolvency, are not entitled to vote. If part of the liabilities includes syndicated loans, all creditors holding an interest in the syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the CVA proposal if at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement, vote in favor. The effects of the duly approved CVA may be extended to privileged creditors (regardless of the kind of privilege) and even in relation to the amount of the claim not exceeding the secured claim value. Notwithstanding this, in order to implement the cramdown mechanism, a dual majority is required: (i) the CVA must be approved by the superior majority indicated below; and (ii) the CVA must also be approved by creditors of the relevant privileged class, according to the definition provided under the Spanish Insolvency ----- Law. The superior majorities required to extend the effects of the CVA to those privileged creditors who have not voted in favor of the proposal are the following: (i) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 60% of any privileged class will be required if the measures in the proposal include any of those indicated in section (ii) above; and (ii) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 75% of any privileged class will be required if the measures in the proposal include any of those indicated in section (iii) above. Default of the CVA leads to liquidation of the debtor. Exceptionally, Coronavirus Pandemic has included some temporary exceptions to the creditors’ right and debtor’s duty to file for liquidation, as well as the possibility for the debtor to pursue an amendment to a CVA previously approved, subject to certain limitations and requirements. _Security Enforcement Moratorium_ The current Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s rights (in rem security) in the event of insolvency, to the extent the collateral can be deemed by the Insolvency Court to be an asset necessary for the continuity of the business. The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency until the earlier of (i) one year has elapsed since the declaration of the insolvency without liquidation proceedings being initiated, or (ii) the approval of a CVA that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest. Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The moratorium may be lifted if the court determines that the asset is not necessary for the debtor’s professional activities of the debtor’s business. When it comes to determining which assets of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets. Even when the moratorium elapses, in case the creditors did not commence the enforcement before the insolvency declaration or after the one (i) year moratorium period ends, it could lose its right to enforce separately within the insolvency proceeding if liquidation is declared. During the moratorium, the insolvency administrator is also entitled to repay the claim as a claim against the insolvency estate, up to the value of the collateral as determined under the Spanish Insolvency Law rules, as to avoid the enforcement. The insolvency’s effects on the enforcement of security interests over collateral located out of Spain when the insolvency is declared will be ruled by the Law of the non-EU country where the collateral is located. When the collateral is located in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), the EU Recast Insolvency Regulation provides for the security’s enforcement not to be affected by the declaration of insolvency in another EU Member State. In addition, there are certain rules applying to the assets securing claims in case they are sold in liquidation as part of the debtor business. Depending on the manner the asset is sold (i.e. with or without the security), such rules could imply a sale without the creditor’s consent being required, in special and among others if the asset is sold individually at an upfront price which is higher than the minimum price agreed when the security was perfected, or, when sold as part of a business unit on a going concern, if the secured creditor loses its right to enforce separately within the insolvency proceeding, or 75% of the special privileged creditors belonging to the same class with right to enforce consent the asset is sold at a price implying the amount to the paid to such special privileged creditors, as determined by the Spanish Insolvency Law, is lower than the value of the collateral. Insolvency proceedings may, normally (although the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees other (unusual) conclusions in Article 465), lead either to the restructuring of the business financing in place through the implementation of a CVA or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets. _Spanish Fraudulent transfer provisions of general applicability including during bankruptcy_ Apart from the claw back action in the event of insolvency discussed above pursuant to Articles 1,111 in relation to Articles 1,291.3 to 1,299 of the Spanish Civil Code, any creditor (as well as the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) in the event that the debtor is declared insolvent, according to Articles 232 and 238 of the Spanish Insolvency Law) may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against its debtor and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement; provided the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed under the relevant contract or agreement in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: ----- - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract or agreement and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - that such act was fraudulent: according to scholars and case law, the proof of fraud is objective, based on facts such as (i) the debtor is aware that his act caused a prejudice to the creditor and that there are no remaining assets with which to comply with its debts once the action to rescind has been carried out and (ii) the third party is also aware of the fraud (as construed above) or the third party is involved in such act; - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - the debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Article 1291.3º of the Spanish Civil Code for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia _condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be_ considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is an iuris et de iure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is an iuris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption). Pursuant to Article 1,292 of the Spanish Civil Code, payments of non-due debts made in insolvency may also be rescinded. According to scholars, if the action were to be upheld the third party would be liable to return the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages. Pursuant to Article 1299 of the Spanish Civil Code, the action to rescind the contract elapses after four years, beginning from the date in which the fraudulent act to be revoked took place (however, according to case law, such term begins on the date in which the creditor has had knowledge of the action). Finally, in case of insolvency, the Spanish Insolvency Law establishes that claw back actions regulated in its Article 226 and following do not override the ability of the insolvency administrator (administrador _concursal) or the creditor to bring any other action to rescind the contract or agreement (acción rescisoria),_ and that such action may be brought before the court handling the insolvency proceedings. _Applicable jurisdiction_ The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has its “center of main interests”. This “center of main interests” is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “center of main interests” are considered “the principal insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide. If the “center of main interests” is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”). Other jurisdictions outside the European Union may not require a center of main interests shift in order for a Spanish company to make a filing in those jurisdictions. Nevertheless, recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings not based on the center of main interests or pursuant to a reasonable connection of an equivalent nature in Spain by means of an exequatur process should not be possible and, furthermore, any creditor could file for a non-main insolvency proceeding in Spain. _Limitations on validity and enforcement of guarantees and collateral granted by any Spanish Guarantor Principle of speciality (principio de especialidad) and ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad)_ One of the inspiring principles of Spanish law on security interests is the so-called principle of speciality (principio de especialidad), which means that, as a general rule, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. ----- As a general principle, where two different main obligations are to be secured, two different security interests must be created. No statutory provision of Spanish law regulates the possibility of creating concurrently a diversity of in rem pledges of equal rank over the same asset. However, Spanish law allows for having concurrent and second or subsequent ranking real estate mortgages. As a consequence of the above, there are grounds to sustain the effectiveness of concurrent equal ranking pledges, even though a different view from the competent courts cannot be disregarded. Furthermore, it is important to note that, unlike other jurisdictions Spanish law does not expressly regulate the possibility of creating a single global pledge to secure several obligations (i.e. a “floating charge”), though global real estate mortgages are permitted under the Spanish Mortgage Act. Therefore, there are also grounds to sustain the validity of global pledges, even though a different view from the competent courts cannot be disregarded. Given the above, any security interest governed by Spanish common law (derecho común) may be created to secure various obligations (either one security per obligation or as a global security), but to the extent it is not expressly foreseen neither tested by the Spanish courts, a court ruling might come to the conclusion any such security to be void and null. Likewise, another general principle on which Spanish law on security interests is based is the principle of ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad), by virtue of which any security must secure another obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary obligation is annulled or terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null or terminated. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, the enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor cannot be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that are less favorable than those applying to the principal debtor. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations. A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be considered material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code. _Corporate benefit in cross-collateral security structures_ All acts and transactions performed and carried out by a Spanish company must be in pursuit of and aligned with its corporate benefit and interest and, in particular, directors have a duty to act in the best interest of the Spanish company, although there is no express Spanish mandatory law provision that requires an express and direct corporate benefit. The absence of such a corporate benefit and interest may constitute grounds to challenge such acts and transactions. When assessing whether or not directors have acted in the best interest of a Spanish company, only the interest of such Spanish company is taken into account. Accordingly, transactions undertaken for the benefit of the group may not always be considered consistent with the best interest of the Spanish company. In the context of upstream and cross-stream guarantees, the Spanish Supreme Court has ruled that the subsidiary granting the guarantee or security interest to secure the debt of its parent company or other company of its group, should receive some kind of consideration or benefit, either directly or indirectly, to compensate the financial burden assumed in the interest of the group. This compensation (i) must be verifiable, even if it is not received simultaneously to the delivery of the guarantee or security, (ii) must be adequate and proportional to the burden assumed by the relevant company in the interest of its group, and (iii) must have an economic value. Furthermore, the action undertaken in the interest of the group must be justified and must not put the solvency of the subsidiary into jeopardy. _Potential limitations to notes’ guarantees provided by S.L. companies_ Under the Spanish Companies Act (Texto refundido de la Ley, de Sociedades de Capital aprobado por el _Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio), Spanish companies (both public limited liability companies_ ----- (sociedades anónimas (S.A.)) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada _(S.L.)) may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that_ recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de _responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)). Pursuant to section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the issuance by_ entities incorporated in Spain under the form of S.L.s cannot exceed an aggregate maximum amount equal to twice its own funds (recursos propios); unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution. There is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding the interpretation of Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act on whether the restriction set out therein should apply not only to the issuance of notes but also to the guarantee provided by S.L. companies covering such notes. Additionally, S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales). In respect of the restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)) referred to above, there is no consistent opinion. _Court enforceability_ The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the Spanish courts will in any event be subject to: - Financial assistance restrictions. Spanish law imposes a restriction on the granting of guarantees and security interests by Spanish companies such that guarantees or security in respect of the guaranteed obligations shall not include nor extend to any obligations or amounts that would render such guarantees or security interests in contravention of the financial assistance restrictions provided for in the Spanish Companies Act pursuant to which no guarantee or security interest granted by a Spanish Guarantor may guarantee or secure any payment, prepayment, repayment or reimbursement obligations derived from any finance document used, or that may be used, for the purposes of payment of certain acquisitions or the payment of any costs or transaction expenses related to, or paying the purchase price for, such acquisitions. In particular, the Spanish Companies Act prohibits financial assistance: (i) with respect to Spanish public limited companies (sociedades anónimas), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company, and (ii) with respect to Spanish private limited companies (sociedades _de responsabilidad limitada), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member_ of their corporate group. Therefore, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish Guarantor shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring, directly or indirectly, the shares of such Spanish Guarantor or the shares of its parent company or the shares of any member of its corporate group, as applicable, to the extent that such guarantee or security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance. This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt. Accordingly, any guarantee or security granted by any Spanish Guarantor shall not guarantee or secure the repayment of any of the proceeds that are used to repay indebtedness of the Issuer if such indebtedness was or is used for the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, any guarantee or secuirity interest granted by any Spanish Guarantor will be null and void if it breaches Spanish financial assistance regulations. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes and _Guarantees—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ For the purposes of the previous paragraph, a reference to a “parent company” of a Spanish Guarantor shall mean the company (if any) which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Spanish Guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish Guarantor. It shall be presumed that a company has a dominant influence on another company when: ◦ any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de _Comercio) are met; or_ ◦ when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish Guarantor are also members of the managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of another company controlled by such dominant company. In addition, a reference to the “group” of a Spanish Guarantor shall mean the group of companies that have in common the same parent company (as this term is described above). ----- In addition, article 158 the Spanish Companies Act provides that the financial assistance restrictions referred to above in relation to transactions targeting shares of a Spanish parent company shall also be applicable to its non-Spanish subsidiaries carrying out such transactions. In accordance with the abovementioned, the guarantees and security interests granted by any Spanish Guarantor belonging to the Group shall be null and void if they breach Spanish financnial assitance regulations. - The nature of the remedies available to the Spanish courts. - Reasonability and justification of risk associated with a guarantee or a security interest. The interpretations of the laws of Spain by the courts may limit the ability of any Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or to secure the Notes. Although the law does not establish any limit, certain case law indicates (and certain scholars understand) that risks associated with a guarantee or a security interest provided by a company to secure the indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group shall be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s own perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such guarantor and all this must be evidenced to the judge. - Spanish public policy. - Availability of defenses. The availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, statute of limitations, undue influence, fraud, duress, abatement and counter-claim. - Ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad). Spanish law is based, inter alia, on the principle of ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad), by virtue of which a guarantee or a security interest, in general terms, under Spanish law, must secure another obligation to which it is ancillary so the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or the security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the relevant guarantee or security. Therefore, a Guarantee or a Collateral given by a Spanish Guarantor may be deemed null and void under Spanish law in the event that all or part of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes which are guaranteed by virtue of such Guarantees or Collateral are null or void, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes. In the event that the guarantors or security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantors’ or security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable. - Limitation on claims. Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (five years since the obligation becomes enforceable being the general term established for obligations in personam) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. In addition, an extension of maturity granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee. - Security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the secured parties under the relevant security document, and each secured party must accept said security interest. See “Trust and security agent _under Spanish law.”_ - Under Spanish law, the valid creation of an in rem right of security requires at least the formalization of the relevant security document as a public deed (escritura o póliza) (unless the security qualifies as a financial collateral under Royal Decree Law 5/2005), without prejudice to any additional formalities or perfection requirements that may be required depending on the type of secured asset. Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties (i) will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio _ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to_ follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario) and (ii) will not be considered as secured creditors having a special privilege over the assets part of the security package in case of insolvency of the relevant Spanish security provider. See “—General enforcement limitations under Spanish law” for other factors that may limit the enforcement of contracts. According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in the place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as receivables or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical existence. In these cases, several theories have been construed among Spanish scholars so as to determine the _lex rei sitae (such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing_ ----- the credit right being pledged, etc.). In addition, according to Spanish law, the law governing the pledge over shares (acciones) is the law of the jurisdiction where the certificates are located. If the certificates were moved to a particular place on or shortly before creating the pledges, and that place had no connection with the security agreement nor with the obligations secured thereby, a judge could consider that the lex rei sitae is not the one chosen by the parties, in which case the judge may apply a different law to determine the validity and enforceability of the pledge against third parties. _Capitalization_ Under Spanish law there are some provisions in relation to a company’s capitalization which have to be taken into account when guarantees are enforced. Enforcement of guarantees may cause the amount of the relevant guarantor’s net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital and, in such case, the guarantor will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency. _Trust and security agent under Spanish law_ Security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the secured parties under the relevant security document, and each secured party must accept said security interest. Spanish law neither expressly recognizes the concept of security agent nor the concept of trustee and, therefore, the security agent or trustee structure may not be recognized by Spanish courts. Therefore, when an entity acts as trustee or security agent of the actual beneficiaries of a security interest or a guarantee (i.e., the creditors of the secured obligations), such trustee or security agent must be duly empowered for that purpose by the relevant secured creditors at the time it acts as trustee or security agent. Otherwise the security interest or guarantee will not be validly created in favor of its purported beneficiaries. Particularly, since the Collateral will be accepted by the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the holders of the Notes will not have any power to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes except through the Trustee or the Security Agent, and the authority of the Trustee or the Security Agent to represent them and to enforce the Collateral in their name and for their benefit is contained in documents governed by New York law and not in duly notarized and apostilled powers of attorney, there is some uncertainty as to whether or not a Spanish court would actually recognize holders of the Notes as secured parties, whether the security over the Collateral will be created, whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured or whether the Trustee or the Security Agent would only be able to enforce the guarantees or the security interest in respect of its portion of the secured obligations but not that of the other secured parties. Therefore, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Trustee or the Security Agent, and enforcement thereof by the Trustee or the Security Agent, may be subject to a due and express power of attorney granted by each of the secured parties in favor of the Trustee or the Security Agent for such purpose, duly notarized and legalized (or, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961). The holders of the Notes, from time to time, shall be the beneficial holders of any Spanish law security interests. However, given that they will not be parties to the Spanish law security documents that will be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on their behalf, the holders of the Notes may not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Trustee or the Security Agent (even if they are the direct beneficiaries of the security interests). It cannot be disregarded that, if enforcement of the security interest is carried out by the Security Agent, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered for such purpose by means of a power of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the secured parties duly notarized and, if not granted in Spain, with the apostille of the Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961 or legalized. In the absence of the abovementioned powers of attorney, the Security Agent may not be able to enforce the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the holders of the Notes), and there is a risk that the Security Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it individually holds (if any), and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as Security Agent. Further, those beneficial holders of the security who have not duly accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors. ----- In addition, the effects that might arise due to application of the Spanish Insolvency Law include, among others, that when confronted with Spanish security in which only a security agent (or similar entity) is acting on behalf of itself and other secured creditors, the insolvency court may challenge the distribution of any enforcement proceeds among the different creditors made by such security agent under intercreditor agreements or provisions. Such challenge would be made on the basis that in order for a secured creditor to have a privileged claim, such secured creditor has to be the beneficiary of the security from a Spanish perspective and that the eventual intercreditor provisions may only bind the signatories to such agreement, but may not be enforced vis- à-vis third parties. Furthermore, the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may be enforced might request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes. _Parallel Debt_ The concept of “trust” and/or “parallel debt” (under, for example, the laws of the State of New York or English law) is not recognized under Spanish law. On the contrary, guarantees/security interests to be valid and enforceable and perfected require that the beneficiary of the guarantee/ security interests and the creditor is the same person. Such guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. Accordingly, the concept of “parallel debt”may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any court precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,314,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,314.9,Germany,314.9.1,Insolvency,"Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under German law (the “German Guarantors”). Consequently, if the “centre of main interests” of such Guarantors is found to be in Germany (see “—European _Union” above), in the event of an insolvency of any such Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated_ in Germany. Such proceedings would then most likely be governed by German law. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more than one EU Member State, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a EU Member State other than Germany. This issue is to be determined at the time when the competent court decides on the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes, as applicable, to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. The Germany Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung) which came into force on January 1, 1999 governs all insolvency proceedings and judicial restructuring in Germany. Major reforms of the German Insolvency Act occurred on 1 March 2012, when the Act for the Further Facilitation of the Restructuring of Corporations (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Sanierung von Unternehmen) came into effect, on July 1, 2014, when the Act to Shorten Residual Debt Discharge Proceedings and to Strengthen the Rights of Creditors (Gesetz zur _Verkürzung des Restschuldbefreiungsverfahrens und zur Stärkung der Gläubigerrechte) became effective, the_ Act to Facilitate the Management of Group Insolvencies (Gesetzes zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von _Konzerninsolvenzen), which passed the German parliament on 10 March 2017 and on 1 January 2021 when_ the Act for the Further Development of the Restructuring and Insolvency law (Sanierungs- und _Insolvenzrechtsfortentwicklungsgesetz) came into effect._ Due to the continuing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic the German legislature has introduced measures that provide for certain temporary rules. These special temporary provisions are not reflected in this memorandum, as the majority of those rules were applicable in the period until April 30, 2021 and have not been extended beyond that date, however, still remain applicable to certain aspects of German insolvency laws. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law ----- point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-`a-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der _Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly_ provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies. For example, in case insolvency proceedings for group companies are opened by different insolvency courts, the insolvency courts have the right to appoint the same insolvency administrator for all proceedings. Possible conflicts of interest can be addressed by the appointment of special administrators. Furthermore, in case insolvency proceedings for group companies are opened by different insolvency courts and different insolvency administrators are appointed, the insolvency administrators are obliged to cooperate to the extent such cooperation would not contradict the interests of the creditors of the respective group companies. Similar duties also apply with regard to the insolvency courts and creditors’ committees. If requested the court can also implement a coordinated proceeding to facilitate the coordinated liquidation or restructuring of the whole group controlled by an appointed independent coordination administrator, who oversees the execution of the proceeding in the interest of the creditors. The coordination administrator will be entitled to submit a coordination plan for the liquidation or restructuring of the group. Such plan will not be binding for the insolvency administrators of the individual proceedings. However, if the individual insolvency administrator decides not to adapt the plan, he needs to provide reasons for this decision and the creditors’ committee can require the insolvency administrator to implement an insolvency plan based on the coordination plan. Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor (Insolvenzschuldner) and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Antrag auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Insolvency proceedings under German law with respect to a debtor incorporated or established as a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or any other corporation or partnership not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder, must be initiated by the debtor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). A debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. However, according to case law, illiquidity is excluded when: (i) it can reasonably be expected that the company will meet its payment obligations within not more than three weeks from their due date; (ii) the liquidity shortfall amounts to less than 10 percent of all due and payable payment obligations and such liquidity shortfall amount is unlikely to increase to more than 10 percent in the near future; or (iii) even if the liquidity shortfall amounts to more than 10 percent of all due and payable payment obligations, there is a probability bordering on certainty that the shortfall will soon be covered completely, or almost completely, and the creditors can be reasonably expected to wait. A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless a continuation of the business is predominantly likely. Whether the debtor’s liabilities exceed the value of its assets must be assessed on the basis of an over-indebtedness balance sheet to be drawn up on the basis of the liquidation values. The continuation of the business is predominantly likely if—as a decision to be taken by the company’s management at its own discretion—it is more likely than not (>50%) that within the next twelve months the company will be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due. In order to determine whether there is such a likely prospect, a liquidity plan must be drawn up. If a German limited liability company, a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation (Societas Europaea, or SE), any other limited liability company or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company is obliged to file for insolvency without undue delay (ohne schuldhaftes Zögern). As an exception, the management may wait up to 21 days in case of illiquidity and 6 weeks in case of overindebtedness (commencing upon satisfaction of one of the tests, not upon the management becoming aware of such satisfaction) if the management reasonably expects that the illiquidity or the over-indebtedness will be remedied within such period. However, these are maximum periods for an extension to file for insolvency. The management is obliged to apply for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay (ohne schuldhaftes Zögern) whenever it becomes clear that this ----- expectation will not materialize. Shareholders of a company and members of the supervisory board are only obligated to file for insolvency if the company lacks management and the shareholder or the supervisory board member is aware of the insolvency or over-indebtedness and the lack of management. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both personal liability towards the company and its creditors for damages that result from the delayed initiation of insolvency proceedings as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, the debtor is entitled, but not obliged, to file for insolvency proceedings if it is unlikely to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due during the course of a forecast period of (typically) the next 24 months (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The creditors may also commence insolvency proceedings in situations where the creditor is able to establish (a) (i) by way of prima facie evidence that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or, (ii) in the case of a legal entity or a partnership that has only legal entities as general partners, that the entity is over-indebted and (b) has a legal interest in the opening of an insolvency proceeding. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted but not yet illiquid it may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” moratorium proceedings (“Schutzschirmverfahren”) unless—from a thirdparty perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). The court may also resolve other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after main insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition (whether it aims for debtor-inpossession moratorium proceedings as outlined above or at ordinary insolvency proceedings), the insolvency court may and usually take preliminary measures to secure the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets other than immovable assets during these preliminary proceedings and will, in almost all cases, appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter),_ unless the debtor has applied for so-called self-administration (Eigenverwaltung) in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The duty of the preliminary administrator is, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse), to verify the existence of a reason for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsgrund) and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. During preliminary insolvency proceedings a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) can be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements (in the financial year prior to the insolvency filing): total balance sheet assets of not less than €6 million (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted), revenue of at least €12 million in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing and/or fifty or more employees (on average over the year). The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking into account the assets of other group companies. Even if the criteria for the mandatory preliminary creditors’committee are not met, the debtor, the preliminary insolvency administrator or a creditor may request the implementation of such committee, provided that the requesting party name the persons that are willing to become a member of the committee and provides consent letters of such persons. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for “self-administration” proceedings (Anordnung der _Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter). There is no fixed_ term for preliminary insolvency proceedings, but due to the fact that the federal employment agency pays salaries for the employees of the insolvent company (Insolvenzausfallgeld) for a period of up to three months, preliminary insolvency proceedings often last for three months. The insolvency court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse) following which the company will be deemed dissolved and put into liquidation. ----- Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, the right to administer and dispose over the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who is appointed by the insolvency court unless the so-called self-administration (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered, in which event the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. The insolvency administrator has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the insolvency estate (Masseschulden) will be preferred to any liabilities created by the debtor (prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (including secured debt, subject to rights of separate satisfaction (Absonderungsrechte) and other security interests). The insolvency administrator or trustee may, on the grounds of avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung), also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Act. Any individual enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) already brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once formal insolvency proceedings have been opened (and may be subject to such stay already prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, certain secured creditors have preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) regarding the enforcement of their security interest. Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte) or transfers of title by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well (ii) to collect any claims that have been assigned by way of security (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case that the enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in aggregate, usually add up to 9 percent of the gross enforcement proceeds, and less German value added tax (Umsatzsteuer) (if applicable), are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Most other claims (Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors unless they are subordinated as a matter of statutory law, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate of the debtor (Insolvenzmasse) after all security interests and prior-ranking liabilities have been settled and paid. The subordinated insolvency claims (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) rank behind unsecured claims. Subordinated claims include, for example, interest and default interest accruing after opening of insolvency proceedings on the claims of the unsecured creditors and certain claims from shareholder loans. Satisfaction of the subordinated claims will only exceptionally occur when all other claims have been entirely fulfilled. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the relevant debtor company. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, the claims against such debtor would be treated as subordinated insolvency claims. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among others and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. An insolvency plan proceeding is a special type of insolvency proceeding which allows for the restructuring of the debtor. The objective of an insolvency plan proceeding is to find the best solution for all parties involved and to make that solution binding on all parties, without being subject to the rigid provisions applicable to a regular insolvency proceeding. In principle, the insolvency plan allows the debtor to be restructured by use of all tools that are permissible under German law. An insolvency plan ----- proceeding allows for example for: (i) shares of the insolvent company to be transferred to third parties (i.e. an M&A process without the current shareholders’ involvement); (ii) debt-equity swaps, including an increase or decrease of the registered capital, payment of non-cash contributions, exclusion of subscription rights or payment of settlements to existing shareholders; (iii) termination or amendment of contracts. Debt-to-equity swaps may as part of an insolvency plan be conducted against the will of the existing shareholders. However, a conversion of debt-to-shares against the will of any respective creditor is invalid. Potential “change of _control” termination provisions are blocked by law if the change of control occurs by way of a debt-to-equity_ swap provided for in an insolvency plan, but termination rights based on a breach of other contractual obligations are not affected. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, may then be required to compensate the creditor for the loss in value of such movable asset. Under the German Insolvency Act, an insolvency administrator (or in the event self-administration has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter)), may challenge acts (Rechtshandlungen) and transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) that are deemed detrimental to the insolvency estate and have been effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance/hardening periods or after filing. Such challengeable transactions can include payments under any guarantee or security or the granting of any guarantee or security interest. In the event that a transaction is successfully challenged, the beneficiaries of such guarantee (such as the holders of Notes) or such security interest would be under an obligation to repay the amount already received under the relevant security or guarantee, or to waive the guarantee or security interest. Pursuant to current regulation, the right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions that have occurred up to ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In particular, a transaction detrimental to the insolvency estate may be challenged according to the German Insolvency Act in the following cases: - an any act (Rechtshandlung) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be avoided if such act was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof (or knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid), or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity or of the filing of such petition (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggested such cash flow insolvency or filing); - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting a creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction can be avoided if such act was effected (i) in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such petition, or (ii) in the second and third month prior to the filing, and at the time of such act the debtor was illiquid, or (iii) in the second and third month prior to the filing and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggested such detrimental effects); - any transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor, or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable if it was entered into, can be avoided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the transaction had knowledge thereof (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggested such cash flow insolvency or filing) or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction (or in each case knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggesting such cash flow insolvency or filing); - any act by the debtor without adequate consideration (e.g. whereby a debtor grants security or a guarantee for a third party debt) might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich); a gratuitous transaction can be avoided if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor, including the granting of guarantees and security interest, during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency ----- proceedings or after such filing, if the debtor acted with the intention to prejudice its creditors can be avoided if the other party had knowledge of such intention at the time of such act (such knowledge is presumed if the other party knew that the debtor is immediate illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig) and that the act operates to the detriment of the creditors); the respective suspect period may vary: if the act (Rechtshandlung) has granted the other party a security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) or has enabled the other party to obtain such a security or satisfaction for a debt, the respective suspect period amounts to four years; if the act (Rechtshandlung) has granted or enabled the other party a security (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung), which the other party was entitled to claim of the kind and at the time, the above prerequisite of an immediate illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is substituted by an actual illiquidity (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If the other party had agreed on a payment arrangement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the debtor or granted the debtor an accommodation for payment (Zahlungserleichterung) in any other way, it is presumed that the other party did not know of the illiquidity at the time of the act. - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded within two year prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or a similar claim can be avoided (i) in the event it provided security, if the act was effected in the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it resulted in satisfaction, if the act was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or - a act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be avoided if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party”, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had knowledge. Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or a trustee avoiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Act described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) may also challenge any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts or has obtained the relevant enforcement order, respectively. If any guarantee or security is avoided or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee or security and would have a claim solely under the notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been avoided would have to be repaid.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

It closes the gap between the possibility of out-ofcourt restructuring, which requires unanimity consent by the creditors, and formal insolvency proceedings. It ----- creates the possibility of restructuring the liabilities of the debtor and certain security for preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) outside the insolvency proceedings and against the will of individual creditors (similar to the insolvency plan procedure, which requires a majority decision by the creditors based on the respective classes of creditors). The core element of the StaRUG is the restructuration plan which is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review and/or supervision by a court. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The court is only involved if the company makes use of procedural assistance or wants to intervene in creditors’ rights against the resistance of the minority. This enables the parties to reduce the involvement of courts significantly and the restructuring may take place in a largely private process. Companies are already able to make use of the restructuring plan at an early stage outside of formal insolvency proceedings if there is an imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (i.e. imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months ). The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under ‘‘—Insolvency.’’) A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’creditors. The approval of individual creditor groups requires, in principle, the consent of 75% of the votes of the creditors within the respective voting class. However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by a Guarantor would be the following: - The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review and/or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g. in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest; or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Consequently, the grant of collateral (including the guarantees of the notes) by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (the “GmbHG”). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net ----- assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). The Guarantees and any other collateral granted by a GmbH in order to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation _language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany._ This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or collateral granted by a GmbH can only be partially enforced or cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of a shareholder to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make payments under the Guarantees, of the beneficiaries of the Guarantees to enforce the Guarantees or of the secured parties to enforce the collateral. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by the German Guarantors. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant Collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees or collateral by the German Guarantors. Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations secured by such security.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the security agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to such parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the relevant Indenture (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the security agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuers and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the security agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no separation right of the holders of the Notes with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the Parallel Debt Obligations) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of ----- the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

These exemptions include, among other things, an exemption for financial assistance granted by a wholly-owned subsidiary to its parent (or any of its direct or indirect parent companies, subject to each such entity being wholly-owned by its immediate parent company) provided that such financial assistance is in the economic interest of the group of companies. Pursuant to Section 8-10 of the Acts, a Norwegian private or public limited liability company may, as a starting point, only provide financial assistance (including placing funds at disposal, granting loans or providing security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or in connection with the acquisition of shares in a parent company (including any intermediate parent company) if the value of such financial assistance is within the company’s distributable reserves.

The principle of corporate benefit also exists in Norway and may in some situations impose a restriction on a Norwegian limited liability company’s ability to offer credits or a guarantee and provide security to shareholders (or close associates of the shareholders) in addition to the restrictions on financial assistance and upstream/cross-stream guarantees, loans and security described above, ref. Chapter 3 of the Acts. Any loans, securities and guarantees of a Norwegian Guarantor may be deemed void for failing to comply with the provisions in Chapter 3 of the Acts regulating corporate benefit and transactions between the company and its shareholders and transactions within the “group” (as defined therein). Furthermore, the Financial Agreements Act of 25 June 1999 No. 46 include certain provisions applicable on a company incorporated in Norway when granting guarantees for the debt of other parties and, inter alia, requires that a maximum amount is specified in respect of each guarantee. The liability of each guarantor incorporated in Norway for the Issuer’s and the other Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes will be limited to €1.56 billion plus interest, default interest, fees, costs, enforcement costs and expenses under the Notes (or its equivalent in other currencies). _Insolvency_ Norwegian insolvency legislation is regulated by the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 No. 58 (Konkursloven, the “Bankruptcy Act”), which sets forth the various procedures to be followed both in the case of court-administered debt negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings, and the Creditors Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 No. 59 (Dekningsloven, the “Recovery Act”) containing provisions on, among other things, the priority of claims. Further, relevant rules are laid down in the Norwegian Temporary Act on Reorganization to Mitigate Economic Hardship Resulting from Covid-19 (Rekonstruksjonsloven, the “Temporary _Reorganization Act”). The financial distress caused by the Covid-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020 prompted_ ----- the Norwegian government to enact the Temporary Reorganization Act which, according to the Temporary Reorganization Act, will remain in place until 1 January 2022. The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the debtor’s assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including the securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) the handling of the debtor’s contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors. Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors (holding or purporting to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy. There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becomes due (the “cash flow test”), and (ii) the debtor must be in “deficit” (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenue, based on real, not book, values) (the “balance sheet test”). During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor’s assets are controlled by the court-appointed liquidator (usually a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor’s assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors. All of the debtor’s assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests and rights with respect to the seized assets, including but not limited to the realization of assets. Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of security during the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate has the right, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets. Furthermore, the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the estimated value or sales value of all assets secured by the debtor for its own debt or by a third party for the debtor’s indebtedness (limited however to the Norwegian Court Fee (currently being in the amount of 1,199 Norwegian krone) multiplied by 700, for assets registered in an asset register (realregister)). Such statutory liens not applicable to financial security (cash deposits and financial instruments) established pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act no. 17/2004 (the _“Financial_ _Collateral_ _Act”)_ or the Norwegian Liens Act no. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9). In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority: - secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset—either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate); - super priority claims (claims that arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator’s costs and obligations of the estate); - salary claims (within certain limitations); - tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations); - ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims); and - subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims). Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the period up to three months or up to twelve-month hardening period depending on the circumstances (and, in respect of transactions in favour of related parties, up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for existing/old ----- debt and transactions at an under-value. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favour one or more creditors at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years. Pursuant to the Temporary Reorganization Act, debtors that are facing or that in the near future will face serious economic problems may petition to the court for the commencement of debt reorganization proceedings. Any creditor of the company may request debt reorganization proceedings if the debtor is unable to meet its obligations as they fall due. The goal of such proceedings is to enable the debtor to restructure its debt, following either unanimous creditor consent (“Unanimous Reorganization”) or consent from a requisite majority of the creditors affected (a “Non-unanimous Reorganization”). The commencement of debt reorganization proceedings result in the appointment of a reorganization official and a creditor committee that together form a reorganization committee. The reorganization committee is charged with supervising the debtor during the proceedings and assisting it with putting forward a reorganization proposal to its creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the enforcement rights of the creditors are suspended during the proceedings. A debtor in debt reorganization proceedings has certain possibilities for securing new financing with security interests over its assets that rank ahead of existing security interests. First, the debtor may, subject to the consent of the reorganization committee, offer super priority security interests over its plant and machinery, inventory and trade receivables to lenders financing the continuation of the debtor’s business activities during the proceedings and the associated expenses. There is no numerical limit to the sums that may be secured on a super priority basis, but existing secured creditors may petition for the reversal of the reorganization committee’s consent if the super priority security interest has a material adverse effect on their position. Second, loans obtained to finance the continuation of the debtor’s business activities during the proceedings and the associated expenses enjoy a statutory first lien over all of the debtor’s assets, subject to the limitations described above. Assets (including receivables) acquired by a debtor while under debt reorganization proceedings will as a starting point fall outside the scope of existing security interests. A Unanimous Reorganization may in principle consist of any amendment to the debtor’s debt. The adoption of a reorganization proposal as Unanimous Reorganization generally requires the consent of all creditors concerned. However, in the event that no creditors have rejected the proposal following the expiry of a voting period set by the reorganization official, the proposal will be deemed approved if it has been approved by creditors representing three-fourths of the claims affected. The following measures may be imposed as part of a Non-unanimous Reorganization: (1) a rescheduling of the debtor’s payment obligations; (2) a reduction of the debtor’s debt; (3) the conversion of debt to equity capital; (4) the transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets to a purchaser; (5) the transfer and winding up of all the debtor’s business and assets with the debtor being released from debts exceeding the proceeds of the winding up; and/or (6) a combination of the above measures. A Non-unanimous Reorganization cannot encroach upon rights of non-consenting secured creditors, creditors that enjoy preferential priority in bankruptcy (except for certain tax claims) and creditors with setoff rights. However, secured claims may be encroached upon if and to the extent the reorganization committee deems that the claims exceed the value of the secured assets. The adoption of a Non-unanimous Reorganization requires the approval of creditors representing a majority of the claims with voting rights. The claims with voting rights will generally be the claims that are affected by the proposal. Following approval of a requisite majority, a Non-unanimous Reorganization must be sanctioned by the court. The court may, in addition to reviewing whether the procedural requirements have been observed, review the fairness of the proposal. Such review will take into account whether individual creditors have been ----- compensated to consent to the reorganization, the burden-sharing among the creditors and whether creditors are worse off than if the debtor was instead subject to bankruptcy proceedings. _Solvent Enforcement_ According to the Norwegian Enforcement Act of 26 June 1992 No. 86 (Nw. tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven), enforcement of claims is contingent upon the existence of an enforcement basis (Nw. tvangsgrunnlag), which may require a relevant party to obtain a court judgment, arbitral award or similar decisions. Obtaining such awards may be a lengthy and costly process. A Norwegian court may reject a mere technical or minor default under an agreement without a payment default as a proper basis for execution, unless the relevant event of default is held to be material. Enforcement of rights under Norwegian law may furthermore be or become limited by prescription, lapse of time or barred under the Norwegian Limitation Act of 18 May 1979 No. 18 (Nw. foreldelsesloven), and claims under a document may become subject to set-off, counterclaim or other defenses. Norwegian courts may award judgment in currencies other than Norwegian Kroner, but the debtor is nevertheless in relation to such judgment entitled to make payment in Norwegian Kroner at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of such payment. Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally binding judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note). Thereafter the creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim. _Trusts and parallel debt_ The concept of trusts is not recognized in Norwegian law. However, Norwegian law recognizes the use of agents, for example security agents holding the security interests on behalf of the secured parties. The concept of parallel debt is not recognized in Norway. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The results which ----- will be reported in the final balance could differ from such estimates. The estimates are used to recognize the allowances for impairment, the provisions for the write-down of inventories, amortization/depreciation, impairment of assets, employee benefits, taxes, restructuring provisions and other provisions. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects for each change are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Some measurement processes, in particular those related to impairment of non-current assets, are generally performed annually, except in the cases where there are indicators which require an immediate measurement of possible impairments. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.

Use of accounting estimates and judgement The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the EU - IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions which influence the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the disclosure concerning potential contingent assets and liabilities. The results which will be reported in the final balance could differ from such estimates. The estimates are used to recognize the allowances for impairment, the provisions for the write-down of inventories, amortization/depreciation, impairment of assets, employee benefits, taxes, restructuring provisions and other provisions. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects for each change are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Some measurement processes, in particular those related to impairment of non-current assets, are generally performed annually, except in the cases where there are indicators which require an immediate measurement of possible impairments. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements of Specialty Chemicals International B.V. have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs) and with Section 2:362(9) of the Netherlands Civil Code. The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors of Specialty Chemicals International B.V. on April 29, 2019. The Group has prepared these financial statement in accordance with EU - IFRS. The Group has not early adopted any new IFRS requirements that are not yet effective in 2018. This is the first set of the Group’s annual financial statements in which IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments have been applied. Changes to significant accounting policies are described in Note 6. With reference to the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income of the Company, use has been made of the exemption pursuant to Section 402 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption. Basis of measurement Financial statements have been adapted, if necessary, to comply with the EU - IFRS and classification criteria used by the Group. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative instruments, which have been measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of hedged assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect gains or losses in fair value in relation to the hedged risks. The Group presents the consolidated financial statements as follows: - current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, are expected to be realized, transferred or used in the Group’s normal operating cycle and, in any case, within one year of the reporting date. Current liabilities are expected to be settled during the Group’s normal operating cycle and, in any case, within one year of the reporting date; - costs are analyzed by nature in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income; - the indirect method is used for the consolidated statement of cash flows; - equity is disclosed using the format that shows changes in each caption (“Consolidated statement of changes _in equity”)._ F-121 ----- Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro thousand, which is the Company’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated. Use of accounting estimates and judgement The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the EU - IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions which influence the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the disclosure concerning potential contingent assets and liabilities. The results which will be reported in the final balance could differ from such estimates. The estimates are used to recognize the allowances for impairment, the provisions for the write-down of inventories, amortization/depreciation, impairment of assets, employee benefits, taxes, restructuring provisions and other provisions. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects for each change are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Some measurement processes, in particular, those related to impairment of non-current assets, are generally performed annually, except in the cases where there are indicators which require an immediate measurement of possible impairments. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Changes in accounting policies Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in note 4 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The nature and effect of the changes are explained below. The Group has initially applied IFRS 15 (see A) and IFRS 9 (see B) from 1 January 2018. A number of other new standards and amendments are also effective from 1 January 2018 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements. These new standards and amendments are as follows: − Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (Amendments to IFRS 2); − Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (Amendments to IFRS 4); − Transfers of Investment Property (Amendments to IAS 40); − Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle (Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28); − IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration. Due to the transition methods chosen by the Group in applying these standards, comparative information throughout these financial statements has not been restated to reflect the requirements of the new standards, except for certain hedging requirements and separately presenting impairment loss on trade receivables and contract assets (see B). A. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control – at a point in time or over time – requires judgement. The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with the effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. 1 January 2018). Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 has not been restated i.e. it is presented, as previously reported, under IAS 18, IAS 11 and related interpretations. Additionally, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 15 have not generally been applied to comparative information. F-122 ----- Group management performed an internal review of the main contracts with customers covering the existing revenues streams. Based on the analysis performed the Group management concluded that the application of IFRS 15 has not a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements, mainly as a result of the industry the Group is operating in. B. IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. As a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group has adopted consequential amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, which require impairment of financial assets to be presented in a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss and OCI. Previously, the Group’s approach was to include the impairment of trade receivables in other expenses. Consequently, the Group reclassified impairment losses recognised under IAS 39, from ‘other expenses’ to ‘impairment loss on trade receivables and contract assets’ in the statement of profit or loss and OCI for the year ended 31 December 2017. Impairment losses on other financial assets are presented under ‘finance costs’, similar to the presentation under IAS 39, and not presented separately in the statement of profit or loss and OCI due to materiality considerations. Additionally, the Group has adopted consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that are applied to disclosures about 2018 but have not been generally applied to comparative information. The following table summarises the impact, net of tax, of transition to IFRS 9 on the opening balance of reserves, retained earnings and NCI (for a description of the transition method, see below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled directly or indirectly by the Parent. The Parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests (if applicable) are measured at their proportionate share of the parties' indentifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Loss of control When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Consolidation procedures The following consolidation procedures are applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: - the financial statements of the consolidated entities are prepared for each reporting period using the same accounting policies as those of the Group; - the assets and liabilities and revenue and expense of consolidated companies are fully recognized in the consolidated financial statements; - intragroup balances, transactions, revenue and expense are fully eliminated; - all intragroup profits not yet realized deriving from third party transactions are eliminated; ----- - the carrying amount of investments held is eliminated against the investee's equity. The portions of equity and profits or losses attributable to non-controlling interests are shown separately in equity and profit or loss; - when the acquisition cost of an investment exceeds the carrying amount of the portion of the investee's equity at the acquisition date, this excess is allocated to specific asset and liability captions up to their fair value at that date. Any residual excess is then recognized as ""Goodwill"" and is not amortized but tested annually for impairment to verify that the amount is still recoverable, using the methods described in the paragraph on _""Impairment losses on assets"". When the acquisition cost of an investment is less than the carrying amount_ of the investee's equity at the acquisition date, the difference is taken to profit or loss; - dividends distributed by consolidated companies are eliminated from the consolidated profit or loss; - for transactions under common control, assets and liabilities are maintained at their historical value, and the excess between the consideration and the carrying amount is recognized under equity reserves; - the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euro at the closing rate, while income and expenses of foreign operations are converted at the average exchange rate of the year. Exchange rate gains or losses arising from translation are recognized in the ""Translation reserve"" in equity. If the investment is sold, any accumulated exchange rate gains or losses are reclassified to profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,314,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,314.53,4.** **Significant accounting policies Consolidated statement of financial position,314.53.1,,"Financial instruments The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, heldto-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following categories: financial liabilities at FVTPL and other financial liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with banks and cash on hand measured at fair value and call deposits with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date. The definition of cash and cash equivalents for the consolidated statement of cash flows and for the consolidated statement of financial position is the same. Trade receivables Trade receivables from customers are initially recognized at fair value, increased by transaction costs. After initial recognition, trade receivables are stated at their estimated realizable value. The adjustment to the estimated realizable value is obtained by adjusting the nominal value of the receivables, to take account of losses due to uncollectability. Provisions for doubtful accounts are always valued at an amount equal to the expected losses over the entire life of the receivable. When the collection of trade receivables is deferred beyond twelve months and the transaction is in fact a financial transaction, the fair value of the consideration is determined by discounting all future income, using a notional interest rate. The category of trade receivables includes trade receivables. The initial valuation of trade receivables is made at fair value on the trade date, i.e. at the value of the consideration due, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Loans and receivables The Group initially recognizes loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. Trade receivables are initially recognized at the fair value, plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The impairment of receivables is estimated on the basis of the present value of estimated future cash flows. Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group derecognizes a financial asset when: - the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or ----- - it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either: - substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred; or - the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial assets. The Group enters into factoring transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position, especially trade receivables. Trade receivables are not derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position, if the Group, in a factoring transaction, retains substantially all of the risks and rewards. The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Other non-derivative financial assets Financial assets are initially measured at acquisition cost which is equal to fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Assets held to maturity are classified as current financial assets if their maturity is within one year, and they are classified as non-current if it is after one year. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is determined using the effective interest rate method, considering any discounts or premiums at the acquisition date and recognizing them over the entire term up to maturity, less any impairment losses. Financial assets classified as available for sale are measured at fair value and classified as current assets. Gains or losses arising from fair value measurement are recognized in a separate component of equity until the assets are sold or recovered or in any case discontinued, or until they are impaired, in which case any accumulated gains or losses recognized in equity up to that date are taken to profit or loss. Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate in force at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate in force when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate in force at the transaction date. Translation differences are generally recognized in profit or loss. However, translation differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”): - an investment in equity securities designated as at FVOCI (except on impairment, in which case translation differences that have been recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss); - a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; - qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective. Foreign operations ----- The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into euros at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI. When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. The exchange rates used to translate foreign operations into Euro are as follows: Average Year-end Currency 2020 2019 31-Dec-20 31-Dec-19 USD U.S. Dollar 1.14 1.12 1.23 1.12 AUD Australian Dollar 1.65 1.61 1.59 1.60 CAD Canadian Dollar 1.53 1.49 1.56 1.46 CZK Czech crown 26.46 25.67 26.24 25.41 DKK Danish krone 7.45 7.47 7.44 7.47 AED Dirham 4.19 4.11 4.51 4.13 INR Indian Rupia 84.64 78.84 89.66 80.19 NOK Norwegian krone 10.72 9.85 10.47 9.86 MXN Peso Mexican 24.52 21.56 24.42 21.22 GBP Pound Sterling 0.89 0.88 0.90 0.85 BRL Real 5.89 4.41 6.37 4.52 CNY Renminbi 7.87 7.74 8.02 7.82 MYR Ringgit 4.80 4.64 4.94 4.60 KRW South Korean Won 1,345.58 1,305.32 1,336.00 1,296.28 PLN Zloty 4.44 4.30 4.56 4.26 TRY Turkish lira 8.05 6.36 9.11 6.68 Derivative financial instruments A derivative financial instrument refers to any financial contract with the following characteristics: 1. its value changes in relation to the change in an interest rate, a price of a financial instrument, commodity prices, a foreign currency exchange rate, a price or rate index, a credit rating or other predetermined underlying variable; 2. it does not require a net initial investment or, if requested, this is lower than the investment that would be requested for other types of contracts from which a similar response would be expected to a change in market factors; 3. it will be settled at a future date. The derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging or trading, depending on its nature. All derivatives are initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost that represents their fair value. Any directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. All derivatives are subsequently measured at fair value. The changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss in the case of derivatives which are not hedging instruments. Hedging derivatives are classified as follows: ----- - fair value hedges, if they hedge the risk of changes in the market value of the underlying asset or liability; - cash flow hedges, if they hedge the risk of cash flow changes generated by existing assets and liabilities or by a future transaction. Both the changes in the fair value of fair value hedge derivatives and the fair value changes in the underlying item are recognized in profit or loss. In the case of cash flow hedges of, for example, the risks related to non-current floating-rate loans, changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income statement for the part which highly effective way risk to which they were put in place, while recorded in profit or loss any part that proves ineffective. The part attributed to other components of comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss when the assets and liabilities hedged impacts the costs and revenue of the period. It is important to note that the Group has adopted a specific procedure to manage financial instruments that is part of an overall risk management policy. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of their purchase and/or production cost determined using the weighted average cost method and their net realizable value based on the estimated selling price less any estimated sales costs. In the case of internally produced inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. In the case of finished goods, this value corresponds to the estimated sales price in normal business conditions, net of the estimated costs to complete the sale. The net realizable value for raw materials, supplies and consumables is represented by the weighted average replacement cost. The purchase cost includes ancillary costs; the production cost includes directly attributable costs and a portion of indirect costs, reasonably chargeable to the products. Work in progress is measured on the basis of the actual average cost for the period, based on the percentage of completion. Obsolete or slow-moving inventories are written down in relation to their presumed future possibility of use or realizable value, through the inclusion of a specific provision for the write-down of inventories. The write-down is reversed if in subsequent years the reasons for the write-down no longer exist. Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, which includes capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. They are shown net of the respective accumulated depreciation and any impairment is determined in accordance with the methods described in the _“Impairment of assets” paragraph. The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognized in profit or loss. The Group annually reviews the useful lives of assets and any necessary changes are reflected on a prospective basis. Any changes, if necessary, are applied prospectively. Depreciation is calculated and accounted for on the date which the items of property, plant and equipment become available for use. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land, whether free of constructions or annexed to civil and industrial buildings, is recognized separately and is not depreciated as it has an unlimited useful life. ----- Assets are presented at cost under “Assets under construction” until the construction is completed; at the date of completion, the related cost is classified in the corresponding property, plant and equipment category and is depreciated. Specific spare parts are allocated to the plants to which they refer and depreciated in accordance with the estimated useful life of the plant concerned. Maintenance and repair expenses, which do not enhance and/or prolong the asset’s remaining useful life, are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they were incurred, otherwise they are capitalized. The annual depreciation rates applied are as follows: Buildings 2.5% - 10% Light constructions 7% - 11% Generic plant 4% - 15% Specific plant 5% - 20% Sundry equipment 30% - 40% Furniture and office machines 12% Electronic office machines 20% Registered vehicles 20% Transport vehicles 25% At the date of disposal or when the future economic benefits are no longer expected from its use, an asset is derecognized. Any gain or loss (calculated as the difference between the sale value and the carrying amount) is recognized in profit or loss of the year. Intangible assets and Goodwill Goodwill is the result of accounting for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment determined using the methods described in “Impairment of assets” the paragraph. Research and development The expenses incurred for development, which envisage applying the results of the research to a plan or to a project for the production of new or significantly enhanced products or processes are only capitalized when the product or the process is feasible in technical and commercial terms, when the Group intends and has sufficient resources to complete the development project, when the costs sustained for the project are determined reliably and when the respective products can generate future economic benefits. The capitalized expenses include the costs for the materials, direct labor and an appropriate quota of production overheads. These expenses are amortized on the basis of their estimated useful life of 5 years (20%). Subsequent to initial recognition, development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. The other development expenses are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Financial instruments The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, heldto-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets. The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following categories: financial liabilities at FVTPL and other financial liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with banks and cash on hand measured at fair value and call deposits with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date. The definition of cash and cash equivalents for the consolidated statement of cash flows and for the consolidated statement of financial position is the same. Trade receivables Trade receivables from customers are initially recognised at fair value, increased by transaction costs. After initial recognition, trade receivables are stated at their estimated realizable value. The adjustment to the estimated realizable value is obtained by adjusting the nominal value of the receivables, to take account of losses due to uncollectability. Provisions for doubtful accounts are always valued at an amount equal to the expected losses over the entire life of the receivable. When the collection of trade receivables is deferred beyond twelve months and the transaction is in fact a financial transaction, the fair value of the consideration is determined by discounting all future income, using a notional interest rate. The category of trade receivables includes trade receivables. The initial valuation of trade receivables is made at fair value on the trade date, i.e. at the value of the consideration due, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Loans and receivables The Group initially recognizes loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. Trade receivables are initially recognized at the fair value, plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The impairment of receivables is estimated on the basis of the present value of estimated future cash flows. Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognized financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability. The Group enters into factoring transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its statement of financial position, especially trade receivables. Trade receivables are not derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position, if the Group, in a factoring transaction, retains substantially all of the risks and rewards. The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid is recognized in profit or loss. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Other non-derivative financial assets Financial assets are initially measured at acquisition cost which is equal to fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. F-69 ----- Assets held to maturity are classified as current financial assets if their maturity is within one year, and they are classified as non-current if it is after one year. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is determined using the effective interest rate method, considering any discounts or premiums at the acquisition date and recognizing them over the entire term up to maturity, less any impairment losses. Financial assets classified as available for sale are measured at fair value and classified as current assets. Gains or losses arising from fair value measurement are recognized in a separate component of equity until the assets are sold or recovered or in any case discontinued, or until they are impaired, in which case any accumulated gains or losses recognized in equity up to that date are taken to profit or loss. Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate in force at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate in force when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate in force at the transaction date. Translation differences are generally recognized in profit or loss. However, translation differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”): (a) an investment in equity securities designated as at FVOCI (except on impairment, in which case translation differences that have been recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss); (b) a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; (c) qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into euros at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI. When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. The exchange rates used to translate foreign operations into Euro are as follows: Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with banks and cash on hand measured at fair value and call deposits with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date. The definition of cash and cash equivalents for the consolidated statement of cash flows and for the consolidated statement of financial position is the same. Trade receivables Trade receivables from customers are initially recognised at fair value, increased by transaction costs. After initial recognition, trade receivables are stated at their estimated realizable value.

The category of trade receivables includes trade receivables. The initial valuation of trade receivables is made at fair value on the trade date, i.e. at the value of the consideration due, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Loans and receivables The Group initially recognizes loans and receivables and debt securities issued on the date when they are originated. Trade receivables are initially recognized at the fair value, plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The impairment of receivables is estimated on the basis of the present value of estimated future cash flows. Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such derecognized financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability. The Group enters into factoring transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its statement of financial position, especially trade receivables. Trade receivables are not derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position, if the Group, in a factoring transaction, retains substantially all of the risks and rewards. F-126 ----- The Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Other non-derivative financial assets Financial assets are initially measured at acquisition cost which is equal to fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.

They are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is determined using the effective interest rate method, considering any discounts or premiums at the acquisition date and recognizing them over the entire term up to maturity, less any impairment losses. Financial assets classified as available for sale are measured at fair value and classified as current assets. Gains or losses arising from fair value measurement are recognized in a separate component of equity until the assets are sold or recovered or in any case discontinued, or until they are impaired, in which case any accumulated gains or losses recognized in equity up to that date are taken to profit or loss. Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate in force at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate in force when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate in force at the transaction date. Translation differences are generally recognized in profit or loss. However, translation differences arising from the translation of the following items are − available-for-sale financial assets (except on impairment, in which case translation differences that have been recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss); − a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; − qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into euros at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI. When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

Other intangible assets, including customer relationships, patents and trademarks, that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses, determined using the methods indicated in the “Impairment of assets” note. Their useful life is reviewed annually and any necessary changes are reflected on a prospective basis. Amortization is calculated to write off the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognized in profit or loss. Goodwill is not amortized. The annual amortization rates are as follows: Patent rights and trademarks 10% - 25% Surface rights 2% - 5% Know-how 33.3% ----- Technology 20% Other 20% - 33.3% Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Any gain or loss generated on disposal is determined as the difference between the sale value and the carrying amount of the asset concerned and is recognized in profit or loss at the disposal date. Asset held for sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, investment property or biological assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale or held-for-distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortized or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted. Financial liabilities Loans and the other financial liabilities are initially recognized at cost, equal to their fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. This account also includes financial payables for existing leasing contracts. The initial recognition of these payables, as well as the valuation subsequent to the initial recognition, follow the treatment illustrated for financial leasing in the account financial leases in the non-current assets section. The current portions of finance lease payables are reclassified to current financial liabilities to third parties. Trade payables Trade payables are recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Trade payables are not discounted if they are due within one year. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of the past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Long-term employee benefits Post-employment benefits are considered a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits.” Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes restructuring costs. If the benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within one year of the reporting date, then they are discounted. The benefits guaranteed to employees in the form of the employee severance indemnity are paid when the employment relationship is terminated and are recognized over the period in which the right vests. The liability for benefits to be paid at the end of the employment relationship is determined based on actuarial assumptions and is recognized on an accrual’s basis consistent with the service necessary to obtain the benefits; the obligation is determined by independent actuaries. Gains and losses arising from the actuarial calculation are recognized in other components of profit/loss of comprehensive income. Actuarial losses arising on the calculation of the present value of the liability to pay the benefits are recognized in the financial expenses. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling ----- (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss under personnel expense. Share-based payment arrangements The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of SARs, which are settled in cash, is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value of the SARs. Any changes in the liability are recognized in profit or loss. Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Group: - has a legal or constructive obligation in relation to third parties; - it is probable that a cash outflow from the Group will be required; - a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Changes in the estimate of the provisions are reflected in profit or loss for the period in which the change occurred. Provisions are recognized as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. If the impact of discounting the time value of money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money. When the cost is discounted, the increase of the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as an interest expense. Impairment of assets The Group verifies at least once a year if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If such an indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is calculated in order to identify the extent of any impairment. This recoverable amount equals the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows or other assets or cash generating units or “CGUs” or “CGU”. Goodwill arrising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The value in use of the CGU to which the asset belongs is determined when the value in use of an individual asset cannot be estimated. The value in use of a given asset is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, before taxes, by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money and of the asset’s specific risks Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ----- An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss if the recoverable amount determined is less than the asset’s carrying amount for that cash generating unit (CGU). The impairment of a CGU is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the other assets of the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impaired asset is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment no longer applies or when there has been a change in the measurements used to determine the recoverable amount, except for those related to goodwill and property, plant and equipment with finite lives which are never reversed. The reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization) if the impairment had not been recognized. The reversal is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for: - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognize a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through sale, and the Group has not rebutted this presumption. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Leases At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As a lessee At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. ----- The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and - the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised insubstance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ""property, plant and equipment"" and lease liabilities in ""loans and borrowings"" in the statement of financial position. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessor At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. ----- When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. The Group recognizes lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of ""other income"". Emission trading At present there is no accounting standard or interpretation that deals specifically with the accounting for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Companies must therefore apply judgment and determine an accounting method based on the general principles of EU - IFRS. The Group uses the net liability approach to recognize emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. According to this approach, allowances are recorded at nominal value (zero). This is in line with the general provisions in place for recognizing and measuring financial assets under EU - IFRS and takes into account the absence of acquisition costs for allowances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
623,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,314,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,314.55,Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income,314.55.1,,"Revenue and costs IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognized. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control ‒ at a point in time or over time ‒ requires judgement. Government grants The Group recognizes an unconditional government grant for operating expenses in profit or loss as other income when the grant becomes receivable. Other government grants related to assets are initially recognized as deferred income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received, and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant; they are then recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognized, unless the conditions for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognized. In this case, the grant is recognized when it becomes receivable. Financial income and financial expense Financial income and expense are recognized in profit/loss for the year on an accrual basis according to the interest accrued on the net value of the respective financial assets and liabilities using the effective interest rate. The ""effective interest rate"" is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to: - the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; - the amortized cost of the financial liability. In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability. All financial expenses are recognized in profit or loss for the period, except those that meet the requirements of IAS 23 for capitalization. Loan costs are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method. Income taxes Tax expense of the period includes current and deferred tax. ----- Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Deferred tax is recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for: - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group and the reversal of temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance provided to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such valuation allowance is reversed when the probability that such unrecognized deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable profit or other management actions. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Revenue and costs IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control at a point in time or over time requires judgement. In 2018, the Group adopted IFRS 15 and based on the Group’s review, the impact of applying this new standard does not have a material impact on these financial statements. Government grants The Group recognizes an unconditional government grant for operating expenses in profit or loss as other income when the grant becomes receivable. Other government grants related to assets are initially recognized as deferred income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant; they are then recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognized. F-77 ----- Financial income and financial expense Financial income and expense are recognized in profit/loss for the year on an accrual basis according to the interest accrued on the net value of the respective financial assets and liabilities using the effective interest rate. All financial expenses are recognized in profit or loss for the period, except those that meet the requirements of IAS 23 for capitalization. Loan costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method. Income taxes Tax expense of the period includes current and deferred tax. Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. Deferred tax is recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for: (l) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; (m) temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; (n) taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group and the reversal of temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance provided to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such valuation allowance are reversed when the probability that such unrecognized deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable profit or other management actions. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Revenue and costs IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control – at a point in time or over time – requires judgement. The Group adopted IFRS 15 and based on the Groups’ review, the impact of applying this new standard does not have a material impact on these financial statements.

Financial income and financial expense Financial income and expense are recognized in profit/loss for the year on an accrual basis according to the interest accrued on the net value of the respective financial assets and liabilities using the effective interest rate. All financial expenses are recognized in profit or loss for the period, except those that meet the requirements of IAS 23 for capitalization.

The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements: - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform — Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16); - Onerous Contracts — Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37); - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020; - Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16); - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3); - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1). In addition, in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, in May 2020 the International Accounting Standards Board (the Board) issued an amendment to IFRS 16 Leases to provide practical relief for lessees in accounting for rent concessions. ----- Under the practical expedient, lessees are not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions are lease modifications, and instead are permitted to account for them as if they were not lease modifications. Rent concessions are eligible for the practical expedient if they occur as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and if all of the following criteria are met: - the change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change; - any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before 30 June 2021; and - there is no substantive change to the other terms and conditions of the lease. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after June 1, 2020. Early application is permitted.

Goodwill was tested for impairment at December 31, 2020 as required by IAS 36 - Impairment of assets. The recoverable amount is higher than the carrying value. The impairment test was based on expected cash flows over a five-year period. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the value in use, which is the present value of forecast cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the specific risks of the individual cash generating units at the measurement date. The forecast cash flows used in the impairment test are based on projections approved by the board of directors. For 2021 the budget approved by the Board of Directors of SCIL on February 17, 2021 was used in the impairment test. Results are expected to increase slightly in subsequent years compared to 2021. Sales volumes are expected to grow on average 3.9%, in 2021 with continued growth across all regions from 2022. Margins are assumed to be approximately stable and fixed costs broadly in line with the volume growth from 2022 onwards, net of synergy savings. The discount rate used was calculated by using the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) method, namely, by weighting the rate of return expected from investing equity in a similar business and the cost of borrowing. The calculation considered the changes in the economic scenario during the years under analysis and the subsequent implications in terms of interest rates. The cash flows derived from the forecast plan were discounted using the WACC rate of 7.9% for Europe, 8.2% for America and 10.1% for Asia, for the various assumptions considering the characteristics of the chemical sector and the Group's specific region, structure and financial risks. Long term growth rate is equal to 1%. The discount rate is the rate of return on ten-year government bonds in the reference market in the same currency as the cash flows adjusted to reflect the higher risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the Group's specific segments. The estimated recoverable amount, which is based on its value in use, exceeds the carrying amount of each geographic segment as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Below we disclose the assumptions for the significant plans in place for the Group. With regard to Polynt S.p.A.' liability for post-employment benefit, the actuarial valuation is based on the changes made to Italian post-employment benefits by Italian Law no. 296 of December 27, 2006 (the 2007 Finance Act) and subsequent decrees and regulations issued in early 2007. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of the Polynt S.p.A.'s liability for post-employment benefits are: inflation rate of 1.2%; annual employee turnover rate of 3.65%; annual probability of requests for advances of 4.0%. The discount rate applied in 2020 was 0.09%, which is the reporting-date rate of return of high-quality bonds with maturity dates approximating those of the Polynt S.p.A.'s obligations and which are expressed in the same currency as that in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The discount rate is the weighted average rate of the Eur Composite AA curve at year end. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of Polynt Composites France S.A.'s liability for post-employment benefits include a discount rate of 0.3% and future salary growth rate of 2.7%. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of Polynt Composites Korea Co.

The expenditures result from known environmental remediation actions at the subsidiary's locations in California, Georgia and Illinois. The total estimated cost is principally for operating, maintaining, monitoring and analyzing soil and groundwater wells, soil remediation, project management and related environmental reporting to various state agencies, costs to expand soil groundwater wells and any other necessary actions required under various governmental orders. Polynt Composites USA Inc. engaged an environmental consultant to review the remediation plans. The provision is based upon the present value of the estimated future cash outflows necessary to complete the remediation. The discounted amount is expected to be paid over the life of the project. Polynt Composites USA Inc. was responsible for the first USD 2 million of environmental remediation costs. Momentive indemnified Polynt Composites USA Inc. for 75% of the environmental remediation costs in excess of USD 2 million and less than USD 5 million. According to the agreement with Momentive and their liability to cover the excess expenditure, Polynt Composites USA Inc. has recognized in non-current assets at December 31, 2020 a receivable of USD 8,805 thousand (EUR 7,176 thousand) (USD 7,228 thousand equal to EUR 6,434 thousand at December 31, 2019). The Group considered the credit worthiness of Momentive in assessing the collectability of this receivable; - EUR 2,788 thousand relating to Polynt Composites USA Ins.' environmental remediation costs associated with the USA Kansas site acquired as part of the CCP Composite acquisition from Total SA in December 2015; - EUR 489 thousand related to other Polynt Composite USA Inc sites; - EUR 3,198 thousand relating to the subsoil remediation at the Scanzorosciate, Cavaglia and San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy) sites owned by Polynt S.p.A.. These forecast costs for the soil and subsoil remediation were made on the basis of Italian Legislative decree no. 152/06, as amended by Italian Legislative decree no. 4/08 and Italian Legislative decree no. 128/10; - EUR 3,290 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the U.S. sites of Reichhold LLC 2; - EUR 2,524 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the France site of Polynt Composites France S.A.; - EUR 1,197 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Taboao site of Polynt Composites Brazil Ltda.; - EUR 692 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Mogi de Cruzes site of Reichhold do Brazil Ltda.; |14,760|4,621| |---|---| |(533)|5,362| |---|---| |31-Dec-19|Increase| |---|---| |18,226 559 461 3,211 361 295 23,113|8,141 6,267 79 171 14,658| |Exchange rate difference|31-Dec-20| |---|---| |(1,833) (47) (44) (166) (1) (2,091)|21,686 6,687 340 1,915 308 295 31,231| ----- - EUR 358 thousand for remediation at the Leek site of Polynt UK Ltd.. An insurance policy covering the remediation risk had been agreed for this site. It expired in 2013 and was not renewed as it is no longer considered necessary. The specific accrual in the consolidated financial statements is the best estimate of future costs; - EUR 470 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Canadian sites of Reichhold Industries Inc.; - EUR 200 thousand for asbestos disposal costs at Polynt S.p.A sites, which does not use asbestos or its derivatives in production activities. However, asbestos is present in the covers and certain conductors. To this end, the company engaged a third-party expert to map out the asbestos at its production sites. This mainly covers the industrial plants in Scanzorosciate, since there is only an immaterial amount, if any, of asbestos at the other sites; - other provisions in relation to other minor amounts related to other Group Companies. Based on information available at the reporting date, it is not known when these costs will be incurred. Accordingly, the Group cannot calculate the effect of the time value of money thereon. The _""Provision for tax litigation — non current"" mainly refers to an ongoing tax litigation of the Italian subsidiary Polynt S.p.A. following to a tax audit occurred in 2018. The tax audit started on June 6, 2018 and was carried out by officers of the local tax inspection unit (""Guardia di Finanza"") and was completed with the notification of the ""Processo Verbale di Constatazione"" (the ""PVC""). The PVC identified two main findings: one challenging the royalty rate charged by Polynt S.p.A. to related parties in connection with the trademark ""Polynt"", as the basis of a total adjustment to the taxable income of EUR 41.5 million over the period covered by the tax audit. The second finding is that a portion of certain costs borne by Polynt S.p.A. was not recharged/rebilled to the proper related party as they should have been, such expenses being allegedly for the benefit of the whole Group. Based on this presumption the PVC provides for a total adjustment of EUR 3.3 million to the taxable income for the tax years 2015 and 2016. On December 23 and December 27, 2019 the tax office issued formal assessment notices (""Avvisi di Accertamento"") against Polynt S.p.A., replicating the findings already identified in the ""PVC"", limited to the tax year 2014, for a total amount of Euro 1.2 million plus interest. On January 21, 2020, while there are well-founded reasons to support the illegitimacy and groundlessness of the tax claim, in order to minimize the consequence on the subsidiary and the Group, Polynt S.p.A. applied for a definition of the 2014 notices. Still, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the settlement procedure could not be completed within the relevant deadline and Polynt S.p.A. appealed against the assessment notices for tax year 2014 to protect its position, whilst it kept on carrying out discussions with the tax Office on the other tax years, aimed at exploring the possibility to settle the case. Based on the ongoing debates it was thought it better prudentially to increase in 2020 the provision by EUR 5 million considering the total provision of EUR 6.2 million a reasonable estimate of contingent liabilities that could result from the definition of disputed cases. _""Provision for Lay Off costs — current"" relates mainly to Polynt Chemical (Changzhou) Co. Ltd and to Reichhold_ Inc. (Dubai) plant shutdown and severance costs. As a result of an agreement signed in November 2020 this company has agreed to discontinue the production activity in its site in Changzhou, China from 01 2021 and the site will be probably completely closed by the end of 2021. _""Provision for Lay Off costs — non-current"" refers to Polynt Composites Brazil Ltda and to Polynt Composites_ France S.A. reorganization activities. _""Provision for sundry risks"" relates mainly to Polynt S.p.A. and to Reichhold India Private Limited._ The ""Provision for agent risks"" includes provisions made for contingent liabilities arising from the termination of current agency contracts, determined based on the ruling legislation for such contracts. The ""Provision for Product Liability Claim"" as at December 31, 2019 included a provision for a claim brought against Reichhold SAS (France) in 2005 by a former customer. During 2020 the claim was fully settled for EUR 6,000 thousand with insurance covering USD 5,266 thousand and Reichhold SAS and other affiliates paying the balance. Accordingly, the provision for product liability claim and the related receivables (refer to note 9) for EUR 8,800 thousand were reversed in 2020. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The RCF is a multicurrency facility available to various subsidiaries of the Company both as loans and letters of credit. The Group's outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2020 were exclusively denominated in EUR, with outstanding borrowings thereunder equal to EUR 16 million. Interest on the RCF borrowings accrues at a rate equal to the relevant Euribor rate floored to 0.00% plus a margin. The RCF terminates on September 13, 2026. Only for the RCF the Agreement contains a ""springing financial covenant"" requiring the Group to maintain a net leverage ratio of senior indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Agreement, of 6.75:1 or less. The springing financial covenant is tested only when the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans under the RCF net of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the relevant quarter is equal to or greater than 40% of the total amount of commitments under the facility and any breach would act as a draw stop to new borrowings only. On October 1, 2020, certain US and Canadian Subsidiaries of the Parent entered into an amendment of the existing credit agreement dated September 29, 2017 with an unrelated financial institution (""ABL""). The ABL provides for a revolving facility available as loans and letters of credit to Polynt Composites USA, Inc. and, with a sublimit of USD 20 million, to Polynt Composites Canada, Inc. The ABL amendment increased the commitments from USD 58.6 million to USD 100 million with the maturity date extended from September 29, 2022 to October 1, 2025. Interest on the ABL borrowings accrues at a rate equal to the relevant base rate plus a margin. All borrowings under the ABL are secured by pledges over trade receivables and inventory of the borrower thereunder. As at December 31, 2020 no ABL borrowings were outstanding.

The new senior indebtedness is under more favorable terms and provides for additional flexibility and a lighter security package. The foregoing transaction involved: - the redemption of the Notes issued under the Indenture totaling EUR 164.2 million; - the prepayment of Euro and USD Loans under the Facility Agreement totaling respectively EUR 191.6 million and USD 166.1 million; - the prepayment of loans outstanding under the Super Senior Revolving Facility Agreement totaling EUR 37.3 million. In connection therewith, on March 5, 2020 the Parent and other Group's affiliates entered into a Senior Facilities Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with various Subsidiaries of the Group as borrowers and guarantors and various financial institutions as lenders. The Agreement provided for the issuance of a Euro Term Loan B (the ""EUR TLB"") in the amount of EUR 485 million and for the issuance of a USD Term Loan B (""the USD TLB"" and together with the EUR TLB the ""Loans"") in the amount of USD 60 million. The Agreement also provides for a Senior Revolving Credit Facility (the ""RCF"") in the amount of EUR 100 million. EUR TLB that bears interests at a rate equal to the relevant Euribor rate floored to 0.00% plus a margin was issued by Specialty Chemicals Holding I BV that on-lent most of the proceeds therefrom to the borrowers under the existing senior indebtedness for the purpose of the prepayment thereof. USD TLB that bears interest at a rate equal to the relevant Libor floored to 1.00% plus a margin was issued by Specialty Chemicals International Inc. that applied the net proceeds therefrom to the prepayment of the relevant existing senior indebtedness. The Loans mature on March 13, 2027 with annual mandatory prepayments equal to a portion of consolidated excess cash flow, as defined in the Agreement, to occur beginning in 2022. Additionally, voluntary prepayments are allowed. For USD TLB quarterly repayment instalments are also provided beginning in 2020. Total amount outstanding under USD TLB as at December 31, 2020 was USD 59.4 million. The up-front one-off borrowing costs incurred upon entering into the Agreement have been capitalized and are amortized over the life of Loans and RCF with the amortization of such capitalized costs recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial expense. The remaining unamortized balance of the up-front one-off borrowing costs incurred upon the issuance of Notes and Euro and USD Loans under the existing Facility Agreement was recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial expense. The fair value as of 31 December 2019 of the embedded interest rate floor that was accounted for as regards Notes and Euro Loans under the existing Facility Agreement as if it was a stand-alone derivative was recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial income. Refer to note 32 and note 33 for further information. Fees incurred in connection with the amendment of the ABL Agreement were added to the unamortized initial costs thereof.

In 2019 an accident occurred at Polynt S.p.A. Maleic Anhydride Ravenna Plant (Italy) causing damage to the catalyst reaction. The occurrence was covered by the insurance policy, including for the future loss of margins due to lower performance of the plant subsequent to the accident. In order to restore the performance of the plant and to reduce the risk of future accidents, the company scheduled a replacement of both the reactor and the catalyst in Q3 2021. In light of the ongoing discussion with the Insurer, both parties agreed to settle the insurance refund in July 2019. Polynt S.p.A. received insurance proceeds of EUR 16.5 million in 2019 and recorded only EUR 5.0 million out the total EUR 16.5 million under Insurance proceeds heading as according to the scheduled reactor and catalyst replacement only that portion covers the 2019 losses due to the lower efficiency of the plant.

This section describes the Group's exposure to each of the above risks, its objectives, policies and procedures for managing those risks and the related measurement methods. It also comments on the Group's capital management. The consolidated financial statements disclose additional quantitative information. ----- The policies in place to manage those risks aim to identify and analyze the risks to which the Group is exposed, establish suitable limits and controls and monitor compliance with such limits. These policies and the related controls are revised regularly to reflect any changes in market conditions or the Group's business activities. Through training sessions, standards and management policies, the Group is developing a regulated and constructive control environment, in which its employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities. The internal audit unit supervises management's methods for monitoring compliance with risk management policies and procedures and checks the adequacy of the risk management system in relation to the risks to which the Group is exposed. The internal audit unit regularly checks risk management controls and procedures based on its audit plan, reporting the results to the relevant bodies. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument may default. It mainly relates to the Group's trade receivables and financial investments. Trade receivables and other receivables The Group's exposure to credit risk principally depends on its customers' individual characteristics. The demographical variables of its customer base, including the sector and country risk, do not have a significant impact on the Group's credit risk. It has a specific internal credit management procedure whereby each new customer's credit standing is analyzed before any credit facilities are granted. These analyzes include third party appraisals, when available. Credit facilities are agreed for each customer and they may only be exceeded after the approval of the relevant internal bodies depending on the customers' exposure. The credit facilities are checked annually and customers that do not meet the Group's credit standing criteria may only make purchases against advance or guaranteed payment. The Group has worked with the majority of its customers for more than four years and the non-collection of receivables is infrequent. Credit risk monitoring procedures are based on grouping customers by credit characteristics, geographical location, sector, ageing, due date and the existence of previous financial difficulties. The Group's trade and other receivables are generally from industrial production companies. The Group has an allowance for impairment, which reflects estimated losses on trade and other loans and receivables and non-current financial assets. It mainly comprises individual impairment losses on significant exposures and collective impairment losses on groups of similar assets on which losses of unknown amounts have already been incurred. Guarantees (guarantees not recognized in the statement of financial position) All borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement are guaranteed by certain Holding Companies, the Issuers of EUR TLB and USD TLB, the Borrowers under the RCF and the respective Holding Companies and are secured by the equity of those Subsidiaries.

A general allowance is established for receivables that are not impaired individually or provided for specifically based on losses incurred over the past five years. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulties in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities. Its policy is to ensure that it always has funds available, as far as possible, to meet its obligations when they fall due in both normal and difficult financial conditions, without incurring excessive costs or risk damaging its reputation. The Group's treasury units manage liquidity risk on a centralized basis. Maintenance of liquidity balance is systematically ensured on a daily basis. The Group's ability to meet its obligations on a timely and cost-effective basis is ensured through the careful checks of its net financial position, using IT systems that monitor liquidity requirements on an ongoing basis. The Group has implemented policies and processes aimed at optimizing management of its resources, reducing liquidity risks and, specifically: - maintaining a suitable level of available liquidity; - diversifying the systems used to obtain financial resources; - being continuously and actively present in the capital markets; - obtaining adequate credit facilities; - monitoring forecasted financial conditions in relation to its business plans. The Group believe that the currently-available funds and credit facilities, as well as the cash flows generated by its operating and financing activities, will enable the Group to meet its investing, and working capital requirements.

These contracts provide for the sale of US dollars against Euros at fixed exchange rates and at established monthly dates. Despite having been entered into for hedging purposes, these forwards do not meet all conditions required by IFRS 9 to qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the fair value gain has been recognized in profit or loss under financial income. Interest rate risk The Group borrows with third parties and invests available liquidity in money and financial market instruments. Fluctuations in market interest rates affect borrowing costs and returns on the various types of loans and investments having therefore an effect on the amount of the Group's net financial expense as most of its loans and borrowings bear floating interest rates. ----- The bank loans with terms and conditions at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are illustrated in the table below:",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

This hierarchy gives the highest priority to (unadjusted) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The three levels are: - Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); - Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of the Group's financial assets and liabilities at the reporting dates approximate their fair values.

The tax audit covered tax year 2016 and, limited to some matters, tax years 2014, 2015 and 2017. The PVC identified two main findings: one challenging the royalty rate charged by Polynt S.p.A. to related parties in connection with the trademark ""Polynt"", as the basis of a total adjustment to the taxable income of EUR 41.5 million over the period covered by the tax audit. The second finding is that a portion of certain costs borne by Polynt S.p.A. was not recharged/rebilled to the proper related party as they should have been, such expenses being allegedly for the benefit of the whole Group. Based on this presumption the PVC provides for a total adjustment of EUR 3.3 million to the taxable income for the tax years 2015 and 2016. On December 23 and December 27, 2019 the tax office issued formal assessment notices (""Avvisi di Accertamento"") against Polynt S.p.A., replicating the findings already identified in the ""PVC"", limited to the tax year 2014, for a total amount of EUR 1.2 million plus interest. On January 21, 2020, while there are well-founded reasons to support the illegitimacy and groundlessness of the tax claim, in order to minimize the consequence on the subsidiary and the Group, Polynt S.p.A. applied for a definition of the 2014 notices. Still, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the settlement procedure could not be completed within the relevant deadline and Polynt S.p.A. appealed against the assessment notices for tax year 2014 to protect its position, whilst it kept on carrying out discussions with the tax Office on the other tax years, aimed at exploring the possibility to settle the case. Based on the ongoing debates it was thought it better prudentially to increase in 2020 the provision by EUR 5 million considering the total provision of EUR 6.2 million a reasonable estimate of contingent liabilities that could result from the definition of disputed cases. - Effective on February 12, 2020 Reichhold Holdings International B.V., Reichhold SAS, Reichhold France SAS and Reichhold AS (the ""Foreign Controlled Group Members"") have executed a Settlement Agreement with ACE American Insurance Company, ACE European Group Limited and Lexington (the ""Insurance Company"") and a Settlement Agreement with Fountaine Pajot (""FP"") of EUR 6 million as final settlement of the claim asserted by FP.

The governments measures in place in the mainly affected countries will significantly slow down the growth of their economies and we expect global economic uncertainty to be very high and that growth will be significantly depressed by the drop-in demand and production outages in connection with this outbreak. The “stress” on industries will be very strong and the support measures to be implemented by governments in the form of funding, tax relief, facilities will be fundamental.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or errors and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others: - identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to errors or fraud, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from errors, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control; F-58 ----- - evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors; - concluding on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company ceasing to continue as a going concern; - evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures; and - evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. This policy is applied to contracts entered into, on or after January 1, 2019. As a lessee At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (i) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (j) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (k) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised insubstance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. F-76 ----- Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a lessor At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. The Group recognizes lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of other “other income”. Emission trading At present there is no accounting standard or interpretation that deals specifically with the accounting for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Companies must therefore apply judgment and determine an accounting method based on the general principles of EU - IFRS. The Group uses the net liability approach to recognize emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. According to this approach, allowances are recorded at nominal value (zero). This is in line with the general provisions in place for recognizing and measuring financial assets under EU - IFRS and takes into account the absence of acquisition costs for allowances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging or trading, depending on its nature. All derivatives are initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost that represents their fair value. Any directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. All derivatives are subsequently measured at fair value. The changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss in the case of derivatives which are not hedging instruments. Hedging derivatives are classified as follows: (d) fair value hedges, if they hedge the risk of changes in the market value of the underlying asset or liability; (e) cash flow hedges, if they hedge the risk of cash flow changes generated by existing assets and liabilities or by a future transaction. Both the changes in the fair value of fair value hedge derivatives and the fair value changes in the underlying item are recognized in profit or loss. In the case of cash flow hedges of, for example, the risks related to non-current floating-rate loans, changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income statement for the part which highly effective way risk to which they were put in place, while recorded in profit or loss any part that proves ineffective. The part attributed to other components of comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss when the assets and liabilities hedged impacts the costs and revenue of the period. It is important to note that the Group has adopted a specific procedure to manage financial instruments that is part of an overall risk management policy. F-71 ----- Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of their purchase and/or production cost determined using the weighted average cost method and their net realizable value based on the estimated selling price less any estimated sales costs. In the case of internally produced inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. In the case of finished goods, this value corresponds to the estimated sales price in normal business conditions, net of the estimated costs to complete the sale. The net realizable value for raw materials, supplies and consumables is represented by the weighted average replacement cost. The purchase cost includes ancillary costs; the production cost includes directly attributable costs and a portion of indirect costs, reasonably chargeable to the products. Work in progress is measured on the basis of the actual average cost for the period, based on the percentage of completion. Obsolete or slow-moving inventories are written down in relation to their presumed future possibility of use or realizable value, through the inclusion of a specific provision for the write-down of inventories. The write-down is reversed if in subsequent years the reasons for the write-down no longer exist. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, including directly attributable ancillary costs necessary for the use of the asset. If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. They are shown net of the respective accumulated depreciation and any impairment is determined in accordance with the methods described in the “Impairment of assets” paragraph. The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognized in profit or loss. The Group annually reviews the useful lives of assets and any necessary changes are reflected on a prospective basis. Any changes, if necessary, are applied prospectively. Depreciation is calculated and accounted for on the date which the items of property, plant and equipment become available for use. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land, whether free of constructions or annexed to civil and industrial buildings, is recognized separately and is not depreciated as it has an unlimited useful life. Assets are presented at cost under “Assets under construction” until the construction is completed; at the date of completion, the related cost is classified in the corresponding property, plant and equipment category and is depreciated. Specific spare parts are allocated to the plants to which they refer and depreciated in accordance with the estimated useful life of the plant concerned. Maintenance and repair expenses, which do not enhance and/or prolong remaining useful life, are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they were incurred, otherwise they are capitalized. The annual depreciation rates applied are as follows: Buildings 2.5% - 10% Light constructions 7% - 11% Generic plant 4% - 15% Specific plant 5% - 20% F-72 ----- Sundry equipment 30% - 40% Furniture and office machines 12% Electronic office machines 20% Registered vehicles 20% Transport vehicles 25% At the date of disposal or when the future economic benefits are no longer expected from its use, an asset is derecognized. Any gain or loss (calculated as the difference between the sale value and the carrying amount) is recognized in profit or loss of the year. Intangible assets and Goodwill Goodwill is the result of accounting for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment determined using the methods described in the “Impairment of assets” paragraph. Research and development The expenses incurred for development, which envisage applying the results of the research to a plan or to a project for the production of new or significantly enhanced products or processes are only capitalized when the product or the process is feasible in technical and commercial terms, when the Group intends and has sufficient resources to complete the development project, when the costs sustained for the project are determined reliably and when the respective products can generate future economic benefits. The capitalized expenses include the costs for the materials, direct labor and an appropriate quota of production overheads. These expenses are amortized on the basis of their estimated useful life of 5 years (20%). Subsequent to initial recognition, development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. The other development expenses are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are recognized at cost, determined in accordance with the same methods indicated for property, plant and equipment. Other intangible assets, with a definite useful life, are recognized net of their accumulated amortization and any impairment, determined using the methods indicated in the “Impairment of assets” note. Their useful life is reviewed annually and any necessary changes are reflected on a prospective basis. The annual amortization rates are as follows: Patent rights and trademarks 10% - 25% Surface rights 2% - 5% Know-how 33.3% Technology 20.0% Other 20% - 33.3% Any gain or loss generated on disposal is determined as the difference between the sale value and the carrying amount of the asset concerned and is recognized in profit or loss at the disposal date. Asset held for sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, investment property or biological assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale or held-for-distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss. F-73 ----- Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortized or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted. Financial liabilities Loans and the other financial liabilities are initially recognized at cost, equal to their fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. This account also includes financial payables for existing leasing contracts. The initial recognition of these payables, as well as the valuation subsequent to the initial recognition, follow the treatment illustrated for financial leasing in the account financial leases in the non-current assets section. The current portions of finance lease payables are reclassified to current financial liabilities to third parties. Trade payables Trade payables are recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Trade payables are not discounted if they are due within one year. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of the past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Long-term employee benefits Post-employment benefits are considered a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes restructuring costs. If the benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within one year of the reporting date, then they are discounted. The benefits guaranteed to employees in the form of the employee severance indemnity are paid when the employment relationship is terminated and are recognized over the period in which the right vests. The liability for benefits to be paid at the end of the employment relationship is determined based on actuarial assumptions and is recognized on an accrual’s basis consistent with the service necessary to obtain the benefits; the obligation is determined by independent actuaries. Gains and losses arising from the actuarial calculation are recognized in other components of profit/loss of comprehensive income. Actuarial losses arising on the calculation of the present value of the liability to pay the benefits are recognized in the financial expenses. All other costs covered by the provision for defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss under personnel expense. Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Group: (f) has a legal or constructive obligation in relation to third parties; (g) it is probable that a cash outflow from the Group will be required; (h) a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Changes in the estimate of the provisions are reflected in profit or loss for the period in which the change occurred. Provisions are recognized as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. If the impact of discounting the time value of money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money. When the cost is discounted, the increase of the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as an interest expense. F-74 ----- Impairment of assets The Group verifies at least once a year if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated in order to identify the extent of any impairment. This recoverable amount equals the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units or “CGUs” or “CGU”. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The value in use of the CGU to which the asset belongs is determined when the value in use of an individual asset cannot be estimated. The value in use of a given asset is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, before taxes, by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money and of the asset’s specific risks. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss if the recoverable amount determined is less than the asset’s carrying amount for that cash generating unit (CGU). The impairment of a CGU is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the other assets of the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impaired asset is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment no longer applies or when there has been a change in the measurements used to determine the recoverable amount, except for those related to goodwill and property, plant and equipment with finite lives which are never reversed. The reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization) if the impairment had not been recognized. The reversal is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through sale, and the Group has not rebutted this presumption. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Leases The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

A number of other new standards are also effective from January 1, 2019 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements. The Group applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at January 1, 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2018 is not restated. The details of the changes in accounting policies are disclosed below. Definition of a lease Previously, the Group determined at contract inception whether an arrangement was or contained a lease under IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. The Group now assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition of a lease. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group elected to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases. The Group applied IFRS 16 only to contracts that were previously identified as F-78 ----- leases. Contracts that were not identified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 were not reassessed for whether there is a lease under IFRS 16. Therefore, the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 was applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after January 1, 2019. As a lessee As a lessee, the Group leases many assets including property, production equipment and IT equipment. The Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred significantly all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the Group. Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most of these leases. At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. The Group used a number of practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17. In particular, the Group: (a) did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application; (b) did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases of low value assets excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; (c) used hindsight when determining the lease term. As a lessor The Group leases out its investment property, including own property and right-of-use assets. The Group has classified these leases as operating leases. Impact on transition On transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognised additional right-of-use assets and additional lease liabilities. The impact on transition is summarized below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Goodwill was tested for impairment at December 31, 2019 as required by IAS 36 - Impairment of assets. The recoverable amount is higher than the carrying value. The impairment test was based on expected cash flows over a five-year period. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the value in use, which is the present value of forecast cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the specific risks of the individual cash generating units at the measurement date. The forecast cash flows used in the impairment test are based on projections approved by the board of directors. For 2020 the budget approved by the Board of Directors of SCIL on February 26, 2020 was used in the impairment test. Results are expected to increase slightly in subsequent years compared to 2020. Sales volumes are expected to grow on average 2.0%, in 2020 with continued growth across all regions from 2021. Margins are assumed to be approximately stable and fixed costs broadly in line with the volume growth from 2021 onwards, net of synergy savings. F-85 ----- The discount rate used was calculated by using the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) method, namely, by weighting the rate of return expected from investing equity in a similar business and the cost of borrowing. The calculation considered the changes in the economic scenario during the years under analysis and the subsequent implications in terms of interest rates. The cash flows derived from the forecast plan were discounted using the WACC rate of 8.9% for Europe, 9.6% for America and 10.8% for Asia, for the various assumptions considering the characteristics of the chemical sector and the Group’s specific region, structure and financial risks. The discount rate is the rate of return on ten-year government bonds in the reference market in the same currency as the cash flows adjusted to reflect the higher risk of investing in equities and the systemic risk of the Group’s specific segments. The estimated recoverable amount, which is based on its value in use, exceeds the carrying amount of each geographic segment as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of the Group’s liability for postemployment benefits are: inflation rate of 1.5%; annual employee turnover rate of 2.92%; annual probability of requests for advances of 4.0%. The discount rate applied in 2019 was 0.57%, which is the reporting-date rate of return of high-quality bonds with maturity dates approximating those of the Group’s obligations and which are expressed in the same currency as that in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The discount rate is the weighted average rate of the Eur Composite AA curve at year end. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of Polynt Composites France S.A.’s liability for post-employment benefits are: discount rate of 0.5%; future salary growth rate of 2.7%. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of Polynt Composites Korea Co. Ltd.’s liability for post-employment benefits are: discount rate of 2.56%; future salary growth rate of 4.0%. The movements in net defined benefit (asset) liability are as follow:",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The claimant is a French boat manufacturer who claims damages resulting from an osmosis problem with boats built using resin supplied by Reichhold SAS. Since the initial onset of the 2005 claim, three expert surveyors have been appointed by the Commercial Court of La Rochelle and the Poitiers Court of Appeals to conduct a forensic analysis in order to apportion liability between the claimant and Reichhold SAS. Effective on February 12, 2020 Reichhold Holdings International B.V., Reichhold SAS, Reichhold France SAS and Reichhold AS (the “Foreign Controlled Group Members”) have executed a Settlement Agreement with ACE American Insurance Company, ACE European Group Limited and Lexington (the “Insurance Company”) and a Settlement Agreement with FP totaling EUR 6.0 million as final settlement of the claim asserted by FP. F-91 ----- Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement executed with the Insurance Companies the Foreign Controlled Group Members will be responsible only for paying the difference between EUR 6,000,000 and USD 5,266,093. Such difference has been already paid. The involved entities are not expected to bear any residual liability. _“Provision for Lay Off costs (current)” mainly refers to Reichhold LLC2 for EUR 164 for plant shutdown costs_ and for severance costs and to Reichhold Inc. (Dubai) for EUR 921 for severance costs. _“Provision for Lay Off costs (non-current)” refers to Polynt Composites Brazil Ltda. for EUR 165 and to Polynt_ Composites France S.A. for EUR 296 thousand and results from the reorganization process. The “Provision for ecological clean-ups” is broken down as follows: - EUR 6,410 thousand relating to Polynt Composites USA, Inc., which assumed certain environmental liabilities of Momentive subject to limitations. The expenditures result from known environmental remediation actions at the subsidiary’s locations in California, Georgia and Illinois. The total estimated cost is principally for operating, maintaining, monitoring and analyzing soil and groundwater wells, soil remediation, project management and related environmental reporting to various state agencies, costs to expand soil groundwater wells and any other necessary actions required under various governmental orders. Polynt Composites USA Inc. engaged an environmental consultant to review the remediation plans. The provision is based upon the present value of the estimated future cash outflows necessary to complete the remediation. The discounted amount is expected to be paid over the life of the project. Polynt Composites USA Inc. was responsible for the first USD 2 million of environmental remediation costs. Momentive indemnified Polynt Composites USA Inc. for 75% of the environmental remediation costs in excess of USD 2 million and less than USD 5 million. According to the agreement with Momentive and their liability to cover the excess expenditure, Polynt Composites USA Inc. has recognized in non-current assets at 31 December 2019 a receivable of USD 7,228 thousand (EUR 6,434 thousand) (USD 6,881 thousand equal to EUR 6,010 thousand at December 31, 2018). The Group considered the credit worthiness of Momentive in assessing the collectability of this receivable; - EUR 1,714 thousand relating to Polynt Composites USA Inc. environmental remediation costs associated with the U.S. site acquired as part of the CCP Composite acquisition from Total SA in December 2014. - EUR 3,280 thousand relating to the subsoil remediation at the Scanzorosciate, Cavaglià and San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy) sites owned by Polynt S.p.A. These forecast costs for the soil and subsoil remediation were made on the basis of Italian Legislative decree no. 152/06, as amended by Italian Legislative decree no. 4/08 and Italian Legislative decree no. 128/10; - EUR 2,985 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the U.S. sites of Reichhold LLC 2; - EUR 1,726 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Taboao site of Polynt Composites Brazil Ltda.; - EUR 1,282 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Mogi de Cruzes and Bahia sites of Reichhold do Brazil Ltda.; - EUR 378 thousand for remediation at the Leek site of Polynt UK Ltd.. An insurance policy covering the remediation risk had been agreed for this site. It expired in 2013 and was not renewed as it is no longer necessary. The specific accrual in the consolidated financial statements is the best estimate of any extra costs; - EUR 470 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Canadian sites of Reichhold Industries Inc.; - EUR 200 thousand for asbestos disposal costs at Polynt S.p.A sites, which does not use asbestos or its derivatives in production activities. However, asbestos is present in the covers and certain conductors. To this end, the company engaged a third-party expert to map out the asbestos at its production sites. This mainly covers the industrial plants in Scanzorosciate, since there is only an immaterial amount, if any, of asbestos at the other sites; F-92 ----- - other provisions in relation to other minor amounts related to other Group Companies. Based on information available at the reporting date, it is not known when these costs will be incurred. Accordingly, the Group cannot calculate the effect of the time value of money thereon. The “Provision for agent risks” includes the accruals made for contingent liabilities arising from the termination of current agency contracts, determined based on the ruling legislation for such contracts. The “Provision for local property tax litigation” refers to Polynt S.p.A.’s ongoing tax litigation on local property tax (ICI/IMU) for San Giovanni Valdarno area. The _[“]Provision for sundry risks” included, as at 31 December 2018, EUR 9,170 thousand related to Reichhold Holdings International B.V. (thereafter “RHI”) and represented management’s best estimate of the Company’s ultimate obligation related to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) claim. In March 2015, the PBGC asserted claims against most of the non-US Reichhold subsidiaries totaling USD 118,798 thousand resulting from the termination of the Reichhold, Inc. pension plan and alleged pension plan liabilities. Reichhold, Inc. was the predecessor US operating company in the Reichhold group that filed Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings on September 30, 2014. On April 1, 2015 the operating assets of Reichhold, Inc. were purchased by the Reichhold group but the obligation for the pension plan was not assumed by the Reichhold group. The pension plan was terminated by agreement between the PBGC and Reichhold, Inc. dated February 25, 2015, making the PBGC the statutory trustee of the pension plan. In connection with its claim, the PBGC filed liens in the District of Columbia in the amount of USD 22,560 thousand against the assets of certain of RHI’s subsidiaries. In November 2019, PBGC, on one side, and Reichhold Holdings International B.V., Reichhold do Brasil Ltda., Reichhold lnvestimentos Ltda., Reichhold Resinas Sinteticas Ltda., Reichhold Industries Ltd., Reichhold Trading (Beijing) Ltd., Reichhold Polymers (Tianjin) Ltd., Reichhold CZ s.r.o., Reichhold Danmark A/S, Reichhold SAS, Reichhold France SAS, Reichhold GmbH, Reichhold Holding Hong Kong Limited, Reichhold India Private Limited, Reichhold S.r.l., Reichhold Mauritius Ltd., Reichhold Quimica S.A. de C.V., Reichhold Finance B.V., Reichhold AS, Reichhold Norway AS, Reichhold Inc. (Panama), Reichhold UK Limited, and Reichhold BV (collectively, the “Foreign Controlled Group Members” or “Reichhold entities”) have entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the parties have settled the matter by payment to PBGC of an overall amount of USD 16,300,000 in seven annual installments plus interest. The first installment was paid in December 2019. Speciality Chemical International Limited has confirmed to the Reichhold entities which signed the agreement that such liability is covered by one of the shareholders. The Reichhold entities are not expected to bear any residual liability. The provision for sundry risks for EUR 9,170 thousand related to Reichhold Holdings International B.V. was reversed during 2019. Included in the “Provision for sundry risks” as at 31 December 2018 there was a charge for an onerous lease associated with the former Reichhold U.S. headquarters site totaling EUR 5,586 thousand. This onerous lease associated with the former Reichhold U.S. headquarters was terminated in 2019 and the 31 December 2018 provision was reversed.

The RCF is a multicurrency facility available to various subsidiaries of the Company both as loans and letters of credit. The Group’s outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2019 were exclusively denominated both in EUR, with outstanding borrowings equal to EUR 37.2 million. Interest on the RCF borrowings accrues at a rate equal to the relevant EURIBOR or LIBOR rate floored to 0.0% plus a margin. The RCF terminates on May 17, 2023. All borrowings under the RCF are guaranteed by most of the Company’s subsidiaries and are secured by the equity and certain assets of those subsidiaries. The RCF contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. The RCF also contains a “springing financial covenant” requiring the consolidated Group to maintain a net leverage ratio of super senior indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the RCF agreement, of 0.75:1 or less. The springing financial covenant is tested only when the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans at the end of the relevant quarter is equal to or greater than 35% of the total amount of commitments under the facility and any breach would act as a draw stop to new borrowings only. On September 29, 2017 an ABL Facility (the “ABL”) in the amount of USD 58.6 million was entered into with Wells Fargo. The line was available as loans and letters of credit to Polynt Composites USA, Inc. and, until November 2019 with a sublimit of USD 20 million, to Polynt Composites Canada, Inc.. The original borrowings thereunder were used to redeem Notes and prepay Loans on a pro rata basis, as permitted under the Agreement and the Indenture.

The Agreement provided for the issuance of EUR senior loans (the “GSO Loan - EUR part”) totaling EUR 229.9 million and for the issuance of USD senior loans (the “GSO Loan - USD part”) totaling USD 199.2 million. EUR loans bear interest at a rate equal to the 3-month EURIBOR floored to 0.50% plus a margin, with interest reset and payable quarterly. USD loans bear interest at a rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR floored to 1.00% plus a margin, with interest reset and payable quarterly. Due to the EURIBOR and LIBOR rates being floored, management has determined the existence of an embedded derivative whose value has been assessed and separated from the host loan agreement in order for it to be accounted for separately, as if it was a stand-alone derivative. Changes over time in the value of the embedded derivative are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the embedded interest rate floor as of December 31, 2019 was equal to EUR 5.9 million. The negative change in the fair value that occurred in 2019 equals EUR 0.9 million and is recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial loss. The up-front one-off borrowing costs incurred upon the issuance of EUR and USD Loans have been capitalized and are amortized over the life of the loans with the amortization of such capitalized costs recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial expense. Both the EUR and the USD loans mature on May 15, 2024 with annual mandatory prepayments equal to a portion of consolidated excess cash flow (the “ECF”) as defined in the Agreement to occur beginning in 2019. Additionally, voluntary prepayments are allowed, provided that all loans outstanding under the Agreement are prepaid on a pro-rata basis. In October 2017 the Group elected to prepay a portion of the loans by entering an ABL Facility in the USA and applying the proceeds arising from the initial borrowings thereunder to the pro-rata prepayment of an aggregate amount such that the Group’s total remaining outstanding loans under the Agreement as of December 31, 2018 was USD 182.6 million and EUR 210.6 million. In May 2019 the Group made the mandatory ECF prepayment by electing to also make a voluntary ECF prepayment as provided by the Agreement. Pursuant to such ECF prepayments the Group’s total remaining outstanding loans under the Agreement as of December 31, 2019 were USD 166.1 million and EUR 191.6 million. The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. F-95 ----- An Indenture, with Polynt S.p.A. and Polimeri Speciali Holding S.p.A. (“PSH”) as issuers and guarantors of EUR senior floating rate notes (the “GSO Italian Notes”) and several subsidiaries of the Group as guarantors thereof. The Notes were purchased by various financial institutions, all of which were unrelated to the Company. Polynt S.p.A. issued Notes totaling EUR 139.1 million whereas PSH issued Notes totaling EUR 57.9 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate equal to the 3-month EURIBOR floored to 0.50% plus a margin, with interest reset and payable quarterly. As commented on with respect to EUR Loans, due to the EURIBOR rate being floored, management has determined the existence of an embedded derivative whose value has been assessed and separated from the host indenture in order for it to be accounted for separately, as if it was a stand-alone derivative. The fair value of the embedded interest rate floor as of December 31, 2018 was equal to EUR 4.3 million. The fair value of the embedded interest rate floor as of December 31, 2019 was equal to EUR 5.0 million. The change in the fair value occurred 2019, equal to EUR 0.7 million and is recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial loss. The up-front one-off borrowing costs incurred upon the issuance of Notes have been capitalized and are amortized over the life of the loans with the amortization of such capitalized costs recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial expense. The Notes mature on May 15, 2024 with annual mandatory prepayments equal to a portion of ECF, as defined in the Indenture, beginning in 2019. Additionally, voluntary prepayments are allowed, provided that the Notes outstanding are prepaid on a pro rata basis between themselves and with the outstanding loans under the Agreement. In October 2017 the Group elected to prepay a portion of the loans by entering an ABL Facility in the USA (described above) and applying the proceeds arising from the initial borrowings thereunder to the pro-rata prepayment of an aggregate amount such that the total remaining outstanding Notes as of December 31, 2017 was EUR 180.5 million. Pursuant to the merger of PSH into Polynt S.p.A. in November 2018 the Notes originally issued by the former were assumed by the latter. In May 2019 the Group made the ECF mandatory prepayment by electing to also make a voluntary ECF prepayment as provided by the Indenture. Pursuant to such ECF prepayments the Group’s total remaining outstanding Notes as of December 31, 2019 were Euro 164.2 million. The Indenture provides for the same customary affirmative and negative covenants as those provided under the Agreement. As commented on with respect to the “Significant events after the reporting period” on March 18, 2020 the Group finalized the refinancing of the existing senior indebtedness that was originally incurred in connection with the merger occurred in May 2017. Such a transaction involved: - the redemption of the Notes issued under the Indenture totaling EUR 164.2 million, - the prepayment of the Euro and USD Loans under the Facility Agreement totaling respectively EUR 191.6 million and USD 166.1 million, - the prepayment of loans outstanding under the Super Senior Revolving Facility Agreement totaling EUR 37.2 million.

In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The three levels are: - Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); - Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

(Panama), Reichhold UK Limited, and Reichhold BV (the “Foreign Controlled Group Members”) and (ii) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( “PBGC”) have executed a settlement agreement pursuant to which the Foreign Controlled Group Members shall pay to PBGC the principal amount of USD 16,300,000 to be paid in seven annual installments of USD 2,328,571.43 plus interests that will accrue thereon. The foregoing agreement settles the claim asserted by the PBGC in March 2015 against the nonUS Reichhold subsidiaries. The PBGC had assumed the pension obligations of Reichhold Inc as part of the Reichhold, Inc bankruptcy process. - On December 2, 2019 Polynt Composites Canada Inc. sold its Canadian distribution business with annual revenues of approximately EUR 39 million. - On December 14, 2018, the tax audit of the Italian subsidiary Polynt S.p.A. was closed. The tax audit started on June 6, 2018 and was carried out by officers of the local tax inspection unit (“Guardia di Finanza”) and was completed with the notification of the “Processo Verbale di Constatazione” (the “PVC”). The tax audit covered tax year 2016 and, limited to some matters, tax years 2014, 2015 and 2017. The PVC identified two main findings: one challenging the royalty rate charged by Polynt S.p.A. to related parties in connection with the trademark “Polynt”, as the basis of a total adjustment to the taxable income of EUR 41.5 million over the period covered by the tax audit. The second finding is that a portion of certain costs borne by Polynt S.p.A. was not recharged/rebilled to the proper related party as they should have been, such expenses being allegedly for the benefit of the whole Group. Based on this presumption the PVC provides for a total adjustment of EUR 3.3 million to the taxable income for the tax years 2015 and 2016. On December 23 and December 27, 2019, the Italian Tax agency bureau formally notified the tax assessment (“Avviso di Accertamento”) for the 2014 tax period, for both IRAP and IRES purposes and for a total of around Euro 1.2 million plus interest. The tax assessment contains the same findings of the “PVC”, confirming, among other things, the judgment of “suitability” of the National Documentation exhibited by the Polynt S.p.A. for such tax period. On January 21, 2020, although there were well-founded reasons for supporting the illegitimacy and unfoundedness of the tax claim, Polynt S.p.A. filed for the settlement in compliance with the tax assessments notified for the 2014 tax period. Subsequent to that, the adversarial proceeding with the revenue agency was initiated, and it is still ongoing at the date of drafting these Financial Statements. Since the settlement procedure relating to the assessments notified to the Company for the 2014 tax period is still ongoing, it is currently not possible to provide a precise quantification of the potential liabilities that could arise at the end of the settlement procedure or from a possible litigation and/or mutual agreement procedure (“procedura amichevole”). These potential liabilities originating from the findings on transfer pricing matters and contained in the tax assessment notices for the 2014 tax period and in the aforementioned PVC can qualify as “possible”, but not quantifiable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging or trading, depending on its nature. All derivatives are initially recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost that represents their fair value. Any directly attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. All derivatives are subsequently measured at fair value. The changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss in the case of derivatives which are not hedging instruments. Hedging derivatives are classified as follows: - fair value hedges, if they hedge the risk of changes in the market value of the underlying asset or liability; − cash flow hedges, if they hedge the risk of cash flow changes generated by existing assets and liabilities or by a future transaction. Both the changes in the fair value of fair value hedge derivatives and the fair value changes in the underlying item are recognized in profit or loss. In the case of cash flow hedges of, for example, the risks related to non-current floating-rate loans, changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income statement for the part which highly effective way risk to which they were put in place, while recorded in profit or loss any part that proves ineffective. The part attributed to other components of comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss when the assets and liabilities hedged impacts the costs and revenue of the period. F-128 ----- It is important to note that the Group has adopted a specific procedure to manage financial instruments that is part of an overall risk management policy. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of their purchase and/or production cost determined using the weighted average cost method and their net realizable value based on the estimated selling price less any estimated sales costs. In the case of internally produced inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. In the case of finished goods, this value corresponds to the estimated sales price in normal business conditions, net of the estimated costs to complete the sale. The net realizable value for raw materials, supplies and consumables is represented by the weighted average replacement cost. The purchase cost includes ancillary costs; the production cost includes directly attributable costs and a portion of indirect costs, reasonably chargeable to the products. Work in progress is measured on the basis of the actual average cost for the period, based on the percentage of completion. Obsolete or slow-moving inventories are written down in relation to their presumed future possibility of use or realizable value, through the inclusion of a specific provision for the write-down of inventories. The write-down is reversed if in subsequent years the reasons for the write-down no longer exist. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, including directly attributable ancillary costs necessary for the use of the asset. If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent expenditure are capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. They are shown net of the respective accumulated depreciation and any impairment is determined in accordance with the methods described in the “Impairment of assets” paragraph. The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is generally recognized in profit or loss. The Group annually reviews the useful lives of assets and any necessary changes are reflected on a prospective basis. Any changes, if necessary, are applied prospectively. Depreciation is calculated and accounted for on the date which the items of property, plant and equipment become available for use. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land, whether free of constructions or annexed to civil and industrial buildings, is recognized separately and is not depreciated as it has an unlimited useful life. Assets are presented at cost under “Assets under construction” until the construction is completed; at the date of completion, the related cost is classified in the corresponding property, plant and equipment category and is depreciated. Specific spare parts are allocated to the plants to which they refer and depreciated in accordance with the estimated useful life of the plant concerned. Maintenance and repair expenses, which do not enhance and/or prolong the asset s remaining useful life, are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they were incurred, otherwise they are capitalized. The annual depreciation rates applied are as follows: Buildings .................................................................. 2.5% - 10% Light constructions .................................................. 7% - 11% Generic plant ............................................................ 4% - 15% F-129 ----- Specific plant ........................................................... 5% - 20% Sundry equipment .................................................... 30% - 40% Furniture and office machines ................................. 12% Electronic office machines ....................................... 20% Registered vehicles .................................................. 20% Transport vehicles .................................................... 25% At the date of disposal or when the future economic benefits are no longer expected from its use, an asset is derecognized. Any gain or loss (calculated as the difference between the sale value and the carrying amount) is recognized in profit or loss of the year. Intangible assets and Goodwill Goodwill is the result of accounting for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment determined using the methods described in the “Impairment of assets” paragraph. Research and development The expenses incurred for development, which envisage applying the results of the research to a plan or to a project for the production of new or significantly enhanced products or processes are only capitalized when the product or the process is feasible in technical and commercial terms, when the Group intends and has sufficient resources to complete the development project, when the costs sustained for the project are determined reliably and when the respective products can generate future economic benefits. The capitalized expenses include the costs for the materials, direct labor and an appropriate quota of production overheads. These expenses are amortized on the basis of their estimated useful life of 5 years (20%). Subsequent to initial recognition, development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. The other development expenses are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are recognized at cost, determined in accordance with the same methods indicated for property, plant and equipment. Other intangible assets, with a definite useful life, are recognized net of their accumulated amortization and any impairment, determined using the methods indicated in the “Impairment of assets” note. Their useful life is reviewed annually and any necessary changes are reflected on a prospective basis. The annual amortization rates are as follows: Patent rights and trademarks .................................... 10% - 20% - 25% Surface rights ........................................................... 2% - 5% Know-how ............................................................... 33.3% Technology .............................................................. 20.0% Other ........................................................................ 20% - 33.3% Any gain or loss generated on disposal is determined as the difference between the sale value and the carrying amount of the asset concerned and is recognized in profit or loss at the disposal date. Financial liabilities Loans and the other financial liabilities are initially recognized at cost, equal to their fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. F-130 ----- This account also includes financial payables for existing leasing contracts. The initial recognition of these payables, as well as the valuation subsequent to the initial recognition, follow the treatment illustrated for financial leasing in the account financial leases in the non-current assets section. The current portions of finance lease payables are reclassified to current financial liabilities to third parties. Trade payables Trade payables are recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Trade payables are not discounted if they are due within one year. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of the past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Long-term employee benefits Post-employment benefits are considered a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes restructuring costs. If the benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within one year of the reporting date, then they are discounted. The benefits guaranteed to employees in the form of the employee severance indemnity are paid when the employment relationship is terminated and are recognized over the period in which the right vests. The liability for benefits to be paid at the end of the employment relationship is determined based on actuarial assumptions and is recognized on an accruals basis consistent with the service necessary to obtain the benefits; the obligation is determined by independent actuaries. Gains and losses arising from the actuarial calculation are recognized in other components of profit/loss of comprehensive income. Actuarial losses arising on the calculation of the present value of the liability to pay the benefits are recognized in the financial expenses. All other costs covered by the provision for defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss under personnel expense. Provisions Provisions are recognized when the Group: - has a legal or constructive obligation in relation to third parties; − it is probable that a cash outflow from the Group will be required; − a reasonable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Changes in the estimate of the provisions are reflected in profit or loss for the period in which the change occurred. Provisions are recognized as the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. If the impact of discounting the time value of money is significant, the provision is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money. When the cost is discounted, the increase of the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as an interest expense. Impairment of assets The Group verifies at least once a year if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated in order to identify the extent of any impairment. This recoverable amount equals the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. F-131 ----- For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash generating units or “CGUs” or “CGU”. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The value in use of the CGU to which the asset belongs is determined when the value in use of an individual asset cannot be estimated. The value in use of a given asset is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, before taxes, by applying a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money and of the asset’s specific risks. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss if the recoverable amount determined is less than the asset’s carrying amount for that cash generating unit (CGU). The impairment of a CGU is first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the other assets of the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impaired asset is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment no longer applies or when there has been a change in the measurements used to determine the recoverable amount, except for those related to goodwill and property, plant and equipment with finite lives which are never reversed. The reversal of an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization) if the impairment had not been recognized. The reversal is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For this purpose, the carrying amount of investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered through sale, and the Group has not rebutted this presumption. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met. Leases The Group determines whether a financial arrangement is or contains a lease component. At inception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Group separates payments and other consideration required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and a liability are recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset; subsequently, the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance cost on the liability is recognized using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. F-132 ----- Leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are measured in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognized in the Group’s statement of financial position. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognized as an integral part of the total lease expense and expensed over the term of the lease. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The actual impact of adopting the IFRS16 standard is described in related paragraph (note 7). Emission trading At present there is no accounting standard or interpretation that deals specifically with the accounting for emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. Companies must therefore apply judgment and determine an accounting method based on the general principles of EU - IFRS. The Group uses the net liability approach to recognize emission allowances or renewable energy certificates. According to this approach, allowances are recorded at nominal value (zero). This is in line with the general provisions in place for recognizing and measuring financial assets under EU - IFRS and takes into account the absence of acquisition costs for allowances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

F-134 ----- Of those standards that are not yet effective, IFRS 16 is expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application. IFRS 16 Leases The Group is required to adopt IFRS 16 Leases from 1[st] January 2019. The Group has assessed the estimated impact that IFRS 16 will have on its consolidated financial statements, as described below. The actual impact of adopting the IFRS16 standard on 1[st] January 2019 may change for the following reason: - the Group has not yet finalized the testing and assessment of controls over its new IT systems; - the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that include the date of initial application. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognizes a right-ofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard – i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases Incentives – and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. Leases in which the Group is a lessee The Group will recognize new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of warehouse and factory facilities. The nature of the expenses related to those leases will now change because the Group will recognize a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. Previously, the Group recognized operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized. No significant impact is expected for the Group’s finance leases. Based on the information currently available, the Group estimates that it will recognize additional lease liabilities and assets in the range of EUR 13.5-16.5 million as at 1[st] January 2019. Leases in which the Group is a lessor No significant impact is expected for other leases in which the Group is a lessor. Transition The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on 1[st] January 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at 1[st] January 2019, with no restatement of comparative information. The Group plans to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This means that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before 1[st] January 2019 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. Other standards The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. - IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Tax Treatments. - Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9). - Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28). F-135 ----- - Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments to IAS 19). - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015–2017 – Cycle various standards. - Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards. - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.

The change in Goodwill amount respect to 31 Dec 2017 is related to the effect of exchange rate, mainly to the part allocated to the US components. As at December 31[st], 2018 and 2017, the carrying value of goodwill by regional CGU is as follows: (Euro thousand) **31-Dec-18** **31-Dec-17 Europe ..................................................................................................................... 37,105 37,123 Americas ................................................................................................................. 23,652 22,608 Asia ......................................................................................................................... 6,013 6,011",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Goodwill was tested for impairment at December 31[st], 2018 as required by IAS 36 - Impairment of assets. Its recoverable amount is higher than its carrying amount. The impairment test was based on expected cash flows over a five-year period. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the value in use, which is the present value of forecast cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the specific risks of the individual cash generating units at the measurement date. The forecast cash flows used in the impairment test are based on projections approved by the board of directors. For 2019 the budget approved by the Board of Directors of SCIL on February 21[st], 2019 was used in the impairment test. Results are expected to increase slightly in subsequent years compared to 2019. Sales volumes are expected to grow on average 2.4%, in 2019 and steady growth tailored for Each Region by 2020. Europe 2019 forecasted margins are declining and are expected to remain stable thereafter. Americas and Asia margins are overall growing versus 2018 with a stability by 2020. Normalized fixed costs are stable in 2019 and in line with the growth in volumes, specifically sized for each Region for the following years. The discount rate used was calculated by using the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) method, namely, by weighting the rate of return expected from investing equity in a similar business and the cost of borrowing. The calculation considered the changes in the economic scenario during the years under analysis and the consequent implications in terms of interest rates. The cash flows deriving from the plan were discounted using the WACC rate of 9.3% for Europe, 10.2% for America and 10.7% for Asia, parameterized for each assumption, considering the characteristics of the chemical sector and the Group’s specific region, structure and financial risks. The discount rate is the rate of return on the ten-year government bonds in the reference market in the same currency as the cash flows, adjusted to reflect the higher risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the Group’s specific segment. The estimated recoverable amount, which is based on its value in use, exceeds the carrying amount of each geographic segment as follows: F-141 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The discount rate applied in 2018 was 1.26%, which is the reporting-date rate of return of high quality bonds with maturity dates approximating those of the Group’s obligations and which are expressed in the same currency as F-146 ----- that in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The discount rate is the weighted average rate of the Eur Composite AA curve at year end. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of Polynt Composites France S.A.’s liability for post-employment benefits are: discount rate of 1.5%; future salary growth rate of 2.7%. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of Polynt Composites Korea Co. Ltd.’s liability for post-employment benefits are: discount rate of 3.0%; future salary growth rate of 3.5%. The movement in net defined benefit (asset) liability are as follow:",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The claimant is a French boat manufacturer who claims damages resulting from an osmosis problem with boats built using resin supplied by Reichhold SAS. Since the initial onset of the 2005 claim, three expert surveyors have been appointed by the Commercial Court of La Rochelle and the Poitiers Court of Appeals to conduct a forensic analysis in order to apportion liability between the claimant and Reichhold SAS. Reichhold SAS and the claimant have been in settlement discussions, and Reichhold SAS has provided reserves based on its best estimate of the ultimate obligation for this matter. Reichhold SAS through Reichhold LLC2 has insurance coverage and management believes that it has satisfied its deductible under the relevant insurance policy. Management believes that the insurance reimbursement is virtually certain and has recorded a receivable from its insurer for the full amount of the provision as an insurance claim receivable in other current assets. _“Provision for Lay Off costs (current)” includes EUR 2,276 related to Reichhold LLC2 for plant shutdown costs_ and for severance costs, EUR 993 related to Reichhold Industries Limited (Canada) and EUR 993 related to Reichhold Inc. (Dubai) for severance costs. _“Provision for Lay Off costs (non-current)” mainly refers to Polynt Composites Brazil Ltda. for EUR 480 and to_ Polynt Composites France S.A. for EUR 264 thousand and results from the reorganization process. The “Provision for ecological clean-ups” is broken down as follows: - EUR 5,972 thousand relating to Polynt Composites USA, Inc., which assumed certain environmental liabilities of Momentive subject to limitations (previous owner of Polynt Composites USA Inc.). The expenditures result from known environmental remediation actions at the subsidiary’s locations in California, Georgia and Illinois. The total estimated cost is principally for operating, maintaining, monitoring and analyzing soil and groundwater wells, soil remediation, project management and related environmental reporting to various state agencies, costs to expand soil groundwater wells and any other necessary actions required under various governmental orders. Polynt Composites USA Inc. engaged an environmental consultant to review the remediation plans. The provision is based upon the present value of the estimated future cash outflows necessary to complete the remediation. The discounted amount is expected to be paid over the life of the project. Polynt Composites USA Inc. was responsible for the first USD 2 million of environmental remediation costs. Momentive indemnified Polynt Composites USA Inc. for 75% of the F-148 ----- environmental remediation costs in excess of USD 2 million and less than USD 5 million. According to the agreement with Momentive and their liability to cover the excess expenditure, Polynt Composites USA Inc. has recognized in non-current assets at 31[st] December 2018 a receivable of USD 6,881 thousand (EUR 6,010 thousand). The Group considered the credit worthiness of Momentive in assessing the collectability of this receivable; - EUR 1,774 thousand relating to Polynt Composites USA, Inc. environmental remediation costs associated with the U.S. Kansas site acquired as part of the CCP Composite acquisition from Total SA in December 2015; - EUR 3,366 thousand relating to the subsoil remediation at the Scanzorosciate, Cavaglià and San Giovanni Valdarno (Italy) sites owned by Polynt S.p.A. These forecast costs for the soil and subsoil remediation were made on the basis of Italian Legislative decree no. 152/06, as amended by Italian Legislative decree no. 4/08 and Italian Legislative decree no. 128/10. The updated estimate of the cost of cleaning up contaminated areas of the plant site in Scanzorosciate confirmed the amount estimated last year; - EUR 2,166 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the U.S. sites of Reichhold LLC2; - EUR 1,886 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Taboao site of Polynt Composites Brazil Ltda.; - EUR 822 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Mogi de Cruzes and Bahia sites of Reichhold do Brazil Ltda.; - EUR 360 thousand for remediation at the Leek site. An insurance policy covering the remediation risk had been agreed for this site. It expired in 2013 and was not renewed as it is no longer necessary. The specific accrual in the consolidated financial statements is the best estimate of any extra costs; - EUR 320 thousand relating to environmental remediation costs estimated for the Canadian sites of Reichhold Industries Inc.; - EUR 200 thousand for asbestos disposal costs at Polynt S.p.A sites, which does not use asbestos or its derivatives in production activities. However, asbestos is present in the covers and certain conductors. To this end, the company engaged a third party expert to map out the asbestos at its production sites. This mainly covers the industrial plants in Scanzorosciate, since there is only an immaterial amount, if any, of asbestos at the other sites; - other provisions in relation to other minor amounts related to other Group Companies. Based on information available at the reporting date, it is not known when these costs will be incurred. Accordingly, the Group cannot calculate the effect of the time value of money thereon. The “Provision for agent risks” includes the accruals made for contingent liabilities arising from the termination of current agency contracts, determined based on the ruling legislation for such contracts. The “Provision for local property tax litigation” refers to Polynt S.p.A.’s ongoing tax litigation on local property tax (ICI/IMU) for San Giovanni Valdarno area. The “Provision for sundry risks” includes EUR 9,170 thousand related to Reichhold Holdings International B.V. (thereafter “RHI”), it represents management’s best estimate of the Company’s ultimate obligation related to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) claim. In March 2015, the PBGC asserted claims against most of the non-US Reichhold subsidiaries totaling USD 118,798 thousand resulting from the termination of the Reichhold, Inc. pension plan and alleged pension plan liabilities. Reichhold, Inc. was the predecessor US operating company in the Reichhold group that filed Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings on September 30[th], 2014. On April 1[st], 2015 the operating assets of Reichhold, Inc. were purchased by the Reichhold group but the obligation for the pension plan was not assumed by the Reichhold group. The pension plan was terminated by agreement between the PBGC and Reichhold, Inc. dated February 25[th], 2015, making the PBGC the statutory trustee of the pension plan. In connection with its claim, the PBGC filed liens in the District of Columbia in the amount of USD 22,560 thousand against the assets of certain of RHI’s subsidiaries. In May 2015, Reichhold offered the PBGC a F-149 ----- 15-year note in the amount of USD 6,000 thousand to settle their claim, but such offer was not accepted by the PBGC. Discussions are ongoing between the Group’s management and the PBGC regarding the claim. Included in the “Provision for sundry risks” is a charge for an onerous lease associated with the former Reichhold U.S. headquarters site totaling € 5,586 thousand, which will be released on the remaining contractual period ended in 2025. The “Provision for tax litigation” mainly refers to Polynt Composites Spain S.L., Reichhold do Brasil Ltda. and Polynt S.p.A. accruals for ongoing tax litigations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

The Group’s outstanding borrowings as of December 31[st], 2018 were exclusively denominated both in EUR, with outstanding borrowings equal to 31.8 million EUR. Interest on the RCF borrowings accrues at a rate equal to the relevant EURIBOR or LIBOR rate floored to 0.0% plus a margin. The RCF terminates on May 17[th], 2023. All borrowings under the RCF are guaranteed by most of the Company’s subsidiaries and are secured by the equity and certain assets of those subsidiaries. The RCF contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. The RCF also contains a “springing financial covenant” requiring the consolidated Group to maintain a net leverage ratio of super senior indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the RCF agreement, of 0.75:1 or less.

The Agreement provided for the issuance of EUR senior loans (the “GSO Loan - EUR part”) totaling EUR 229.9 million and for the issuance of USD senior loans (the “GSO Loan - USD part”) totaling USD 199.2 million. EUR loans bear interest at a rate equal to the 3-month EURIBOR floored to 0.50% plus a margin, with interest reset and payable quarterly. USD loans bear interest at a rate equal to the 3-month LIBOR floored to 1.00% plus a margin, with interest reset and payable quarterly. Due to the EURIBOR and LIBOR rates being floored, management has determined the existence of an embedded derivative whose value has been assessed and separated from the host loan agreement in order for it to be accounted for separately, as if it was a stand-alone derivative. Changes over time in the value of the embedded derivative are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The fair value of the embedded interest rate floor as of December 31[st], 2018 was equal to EUR 5.0 million. The change in the fair value occurred in 2018, equal to EUR 1.1 million, is recognized in the Profit and Loss as financial loss. The up-front one-off borrowing costs incurred upon the issuance of EUR and USD Loans have been capitalized and are amortized over the life of the loans with the amortization of such capitalized costs recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial expense. Both the EUR and the USD loans mature on May 15[th], 2024 with annual mandatory prepayments equal to a portion of consolidated excess cash flow (the “ECF”) as defined in the Agreement to occur beginning in 2019. Additionally, voluntary prepayments are allowed, provided that all loans outstanding under the Agreement are prepaid on a pro-rata basis. In October 2017 the Group elected to prepay a portion of the loans by entering an ABL Facility in the USA and applying the proceeds arising from the initial borrowings thereunder to the pro-rata prepayment of an aggregate amount such that the Group’s total remaining outstanding loans under the Agreement as of December 31[st], 2017 was USD 182.6 million and EUR 210.6 million. No additional prepayments occurred in 2018. The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31[st], 2018, the Group was in compliance with all covenants of the Agreement. - An Indenture, with Polynt S.p.A. and Polimeri Speciali Holding S.p.A. (“PSH”) as issuers and guarantors of EUR senior floating rate notes (the “GSO Italian Notes”) and several subsidiaries of the Group as guarantors thereof. The Notes were purchased by various financial institutions, all of which were unrelated to the Company. Polynt S.p.A. issued Notes totaling EUR 139.1 million whereas PSH issued Notes totaling EUR 57.9 million. The Notes bear interest at a rate equal to the 3-month EURIBOR floored to 0.50% plus a margin, with interest reset and payable quarterly. As commented on with respect to EUR Loans, due to the EURIBOR rate being floored, management has determined the existence of an embedded derivative whose value has been assessed and separated from the host indenture in order for it to be accounted for separately, as if it was a stand-alone derivative. The fair value of the embedded interest rate floor as of December 31[st], 2018 was equal to EUR 4.3 million. The change in the fair value occurred 2018, equal to EUR 1.0 million, is recognized in the Profit and Loss as financial loss. The up-front one-off borrowing costs incurred upon the issuance of Notes have been capitalized and are amortized over the life of the loans with the amortization of such capitalized costs recognized in the Profit and Loss as a financial expense. F-152 ----- The Notes mature on May 15[th], 2024 with annual mandatory prepayments equal to a portion of ECF to occur, as defined in the Indenture, beginning in 2019. Additionally, voluntary prepayments are allowed, provided that the Notes outstanding are prepaid on a pro rata basis between themselves and with the outstanding loans under the Agreement. In October 2017 the Group elected to prepay a portion of the loans by entering an ABL Facility in the USA (described above) and applying the proceeds arising from the initial borrowings thereunder to the pro-rata prepayment of an aggregate amount such that the total remaining outstanding Notes as of December 31[st], 2017 was EUR 180.5 million. Pursuant to the merger of PSH into Polynt S.p.A. in November 2018 the Notes originally issued by the former were assumed by the latter. No prepayments occurred in 2018. The Indenture provides for the same customary affirmative and negative covenants as those provided under the Agreement. As of December 31[st], 2018, the Group was in compliance with all covenants of the Indenture.

This hierarchy gives the highest priority to (unadjusted) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The three levels are: - Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); - Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at the reporting dates approximate their fair values. The following table shows the carrying amounts with their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The tax audit was started on June 6th, 2018 and was carried out by officers of the local tax inspection unit (“Guardia di Finanza”) and was completed with the notification of the “Processo Verbale di Constatazione” (the “PVC”). The tax audit covered tax year 2016 and, limited to some matters, tax years 2014, 2015 and 2017. The PVC identified two main findings: one challenging the royalty rate charged by Polynt S.p.A. to related parties in connection with the trademark “Polynt”, as the basis of a total adjustment to the taxable income of EUR 41.5 million over the period covered by the tax audit. The second finding is that a portion of certain costs borne by Polynt S.p.A. was not recharged/rebilled to the proper related party as they should have been, such expenses being allegedly for the benefit of the whole Group. Based on this presumption the PVC provides for a total adjustment of EUR 3.3 million to the taxable income for the tax years 2015 and 2016. These findings have yet to be officially assessed against Polynt S.p.A, The Group believes that the findings are legally groundless and economically disproportionate and will challenge any adjustment arising therefrom in order to assert its rights and minimize the consequences for the company and the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Actual results may differ from such estimates. The significant judgments made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those described in the last annual financial statements. Hierarchy levels to measure fair value IFRS 13 introduces a fair value hierarchy which classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. This hierarchy gives the highest priority to (unadjusted) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). In some cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The three levels are: - Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); - Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

There were no distributions or returns to shareholders. In accordance with the applicable law the companies have been dissolved on May 26, 2021. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled directly or indirectly by the Parent. The Parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and can affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. Loss of control When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Consolidation procedures The following consolidation procedures are applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements: F-179 ----- - the financial statements of the consolidated entities are prepared for each reporting period using the same accounting policies as those of the Group; - the assets and liabilities and revenue and expense of consolidated companies are fully recognized in the consolidated financial statements; - intragroup balances, transactions, revenue and expense are fully eliminated; - all intragroup profits not yet realized deriving from third party transactions are eliminated; - the carrying amount of investments held is eliminated against the investee’s equity. The portions of equity and profits or losses attributable to non-controlling interests are shown separately in equity and profit or loss; - the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date is allocated to specific asset and liability captions up to their fair value at that date. Any residual excess is then recognized as “Goodwill” and is not amortized but tested annually for impairment to verify that the amount is still recoverable, using the methods described in the paragraph on “Impairment losses on assets”. When the acquisition cost of an investment is less than the carrying amount of the investee’s equity at the acquisition date, the difference is taken to profit or loss; - dividends distributed by consolidated companies are eliminated from the consolidated profit or loss; - the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euro at the closing rate, while income and expenses of foreign operations are converted at the average exchange rate of the period. Exchange rate gains or losses arising from translation are recognized in the “Translation reserve” in equity. If the investment is sold, any accumulated exchange rate gains or losses are reclassified to profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656

Thus, the main change in the caption is mainly due to the accrual of Share-based payments, of which EUR 19.4 million related to the reclassification from non-current portion of employee benefits as accrued for the plan in the previous years. Share-based payment (cash settled) The Group has adopted the following incentive compensation plans (“Plans”) for certain Directors and employees: ### - a long term incentive plan (“Phantom Share Option Plan”) was established in April 2018 (grant date) and provides for additional compensation if the following conditions are fulfilled: a) that certain events occur by December 31, 2026 (i.e. change of control of the ownership of the group, listing on a regulated market, disbursement of an extraordinary maxi dividend); b) revaluation in addition to a certain threshold of the shares of the Parent Company Specialty Chemicals International Ltd. compared to the reference value per share indicated in the agreements (Share appreciation rights, hereinafter SARs). The Phantom Share Option Plan grant a total maximum amount for the Holders of Eur 60 million; ### - an extraordinary deal bonus plan (“EB Plan”) was adopted in December 2020 (grant date) and provides for additional compensation if the following conditions are fulfilled: a) that certain events occur by June 30, 2021 (i.e. the signature of a definitive and legally binding agreement for the purchase of the group); b) the embedded equity value of the Group under the agreement mentioned under (a) above is at least equal to a certain amount (and therefore the SARs is over a determinate amount). The EB Plan grant an additional total maximum amount for the Holders of Eur 20 million. Based on the conditions of those plans, the settlement method has been determined to be cash. In the plans there is no transferring of its own equity instruments, only the payment of appreciation amount which is in cash. Besides, there is no choice of settlement either by employee or the entity. Thus, those plans should be classified as cash-settled share-based payment. On June 29, 2021, the Parent Speciality Chemicals International Limited (the “Seller”) and Speciality Chemicals International II Limited (the “Buyer”) entered, inter alia, into a sale and purchase agreement (the “SPA”) pursuant to which the Buyer will acquire the entire issued share capital of Specialty Chemicals International B.V. This has been considered as a trigger event that enable each eligible Holder of the Plans on the terms and in the amounts as set out in the relevant Plans. As at June 30, 2021 the Group management revised the estimation of: ### - the closing date of the acquisition that should happen by the end of 2021; - the equity value of the Group at the closing date, in order to estimate the fair value of the Plans.

Therefore, the accounting impact in the condensed consolidated interim financial statement as of 30 June 2021 Group accounted for the Plans is as follow: ### - a net expense of Eur 46.7 million in the personnel expenses (the expense is net of the portion of the plan which is debited to SCIL, for an amount of EUR 8.2 million and an amount of EUR 19.4 million which was already accrued in previous years) and a deferred tax income of EUR 11.4 million in the Consolidated Profit or Loss for the six months period ended 30 June 2021; ### - a total cumulated current employee benefit of Eur 74.4 million (including the social security charges) and deferred tax assets of EUR 15.5 million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of 30 June 2021; ### - a total cumulated current receivable of EUR 11.2 million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of 30 June 2021 (which include a portion of EUR 2.9 million as accrued in the previous years), for the part of the Plans to be debited to the Parent Company Specialty Chemicals International Ltd (SCIL) as a result of the cost sharing agreement determined on April 2021 (as described in the paragraph “Significant events of reporting period ended 30 June 2021”).

F-191 ----- With regard to Polynt S.p.A. and Reichhold S.r.L. ’s liability for post-employment benefit, the actuarial valuation is based on the changes made to Italian post-employment benefits by Italian Law no. 296 of December 27, 2006 (the 2007 Finance Act) and subsequent decrees and regulations issued in early 2007. The main actuarial assumptions applied at the reporting date for the measurement of the Polynt S.p.A. and Reichhold S.r.L. ’s liability for post-employment benefits are: inflation rate of 1.6%; annual employee turnover rate of 3.65% for Polynt S.p.A. and 3.06% for Reichhold S.r.L.; annual probability of requests for advances of 4.0%. The discount rate applied in the first six months of 2021 was 0.41% for Polynt S.p.A. and 0.53% for Reichhold S.r.L., which is the reporting-date rate of return of high-quality bonds with maturity dates approximating those of the Polynt S.p.A.’s obligations and which are expressed in the same currency as that in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The discount rate is the weighted average rate of the Eur Composite AA curve at 30 June 2021. 21. **Deferred tax liabilities Deferred tax liabilities amount to EUR 68 million at 30 June 2021 and EUR 69.3 million at 31 December 2020. Deferred tax liabilities (“DTL”) on property, plant and equipment are mainly due to the larger carrying amounts reported for financial reporting purposes versus the tax carrying value.

The RCF is a multicurrency facility available to various subsidiaries of the Company both as loans and letters of credit. The Group’s outstanding borrowings as of June 30, 2021 were exclusively denominated in EUR, with outstanding borrowings thereunder equal to EUR 17.3 million. Interest on the RCF borrowings accrues at a rate equal to the relevant Euribor rate floored to 0.00% plus a margin. The RCF terminates on September 13, 2026. Only for the RCF the Agreement contains a “springing financial covenant” requiring the Group to maintain a net leverage ratio of senior indebtedness to EBITDA, as defined in the Agreement, of 6.75:1 or less. The springing financial covenant is tested only when the aggregate amount of all outstanding loans under the RCF net of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the relevant quarter is equal to or greater than 40% of the total amount of commitments under the facility. On October 1, 2020, certain US and Canadian Subsidiaries of the Parent entered into an amendment of the existing credit agreement dated September 29, 2017 with an unrelated financial institution (“ABL”). The ABL provides for a revolving facility available as loans and letters of credit to Polynt Composites USA, Inc. and, with a sublimit of USD 20 million, to Polynt Composites Canada, Inc.. The ABL amendment increased the commitments from USD 58.6 million to USD 100 million with the maturity date extended from September 29, 2022 to October 1, 2025. Interest on the ABL borrowings accrues at a rate equal to the relevant base rate plus a margin.

There were no distributions or returns to shareholders. In accordance with the applicable law the companies have been dissolved on May 26, 2021. - In April 2021 certain group companies have entered into a cost sharing agreement aimed to regulate the apportionment of the costs related to two incentive plans, adopted by Speciality Chemicals International Limited, for the purposes of rewarding and enhancing the relationships with certain managers and employees who play a key role within the Group and are employed by some of the Group companies, upon the conditions set forth in the mentioned incentive plans. Speciality Chemicals International Limited instructed Polynt S.p.A. to manage the implementation of the plan (including the regulation of the apportionment of the costs within the group companies), as it is the employer of the majority of the Beneficiaries. - On June 29, 2021, Speciality Chemicals International Limited (the “Seller”) and Speciality Chemicals International II Limited (the “Buyer”) entered, inter alia, into a sale and purchase agreement (the “SPA”) pursuant to which the Buyer will acquire the entire issued share capital of Specialty Chemicals International B.V.

Completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including antitrust and foreign investment approvals, as well as the performance of certain actions at completion.

Following the completion, the Seller will distribute to Global Chemicals S. à r.l. (“Global”) substantially 45.49% of the profits realized. Following such distribution Global’s shares in the Seller will be repurchased for nominal consideration and subsequently cancelled and therefore the group will be solely under the indirect control of Black Diamond Capital Management.

The SFT also determined that companies who had paid the extra PIS and COFINS tax and who filed a legal claim prior to March 15, 2017 would also be able to recover these taxes paid from prior periods. With the final SFT decision and as the Company filed a legal claim prior to March 15, 2017, covering the periods from October 2003 through April 2017, the Company has included in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months period ending June 30, 2021 an amount of approximately BRL 100 million (EUR 15.4 million) for these available tax credits.",N/A,as_expected,2021,656
