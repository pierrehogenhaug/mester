OFFERING MEMORANDUM NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION
IN THE UNITED STATES

##### Verde Bidco S.p.A.
**€450,000,000 4.625% Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2026**

Verde Bidco S.p.A. (formerly known as Noosa S.r.l.), a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy (the “Issuer”), is
offering (the “Offering”) €450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.625% Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”), to be used as part
of the financing for the proposed acquisition of SSCP Green Holdings S.C.A., a Luxembourg limited liability company (société en commandite par actions) (the
“Target”), and its subsidiaries (together with the Target, the “Target Group”) by the Issuer (the “Acquisition”). See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of
_Proceeds.” The Issuer is a holding company and will not control the Target prior to the consummation of the Acquisition._
The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a rate equal to 4.625% per annum. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each
year, commencing on April 1, 2022. The Notes will mature on October 1, 2026. At any time on or after October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the
redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum (this “Offering Memorandum”). At any time prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, and additional
amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” The Issuer will also be required to pay a Step-up Premium
(as defined herein) upon the redemption of the Notes at maturity and/or prior thereto in connection with certain optional redemptions of the Notes if we fail to achieve one or
both of the Sustainability Performance Targets (as defined herein). See “Description of Notes—Sustainability Performance Targets Step-up Redemption Premium.” At any time
prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any additional Notes), using the net cash proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date, and additional amounts, if any, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any additional Notes) remains
outstanding after each redemption. At any time prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date (as defined
herein) up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued (including any additional Notes) at its option, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to
103.000% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, and additional amounts, if any.
If a change of control occurs, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of purchase. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the
Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. See “Description of Notes.”
If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the
closing of the Offering on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of this Offering of Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) in the name of
the Issuer. The Escrow Account will be controlled by Bank of America, National Association (the “Escrow Agent”) and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Notes. The release of the escrowed proceeds from the Escrow Account will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. If the proceeds of the Notes
are deposited into the Escrow Account and the conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds have not been satisfied on or prior to January 31, 2022 (the “Escrow
**Long-Stop Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price**
of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the initial issue price the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but
excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Following the Completion Date
(as defined herein), we intend to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to merge the
Issuer with the Target and Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. (“Itelyum Regeneration”) in accordance with applicable provisions of Italian law and as further described herein
(the “Post Completion Merger”), with MergerCo (as defined herein) being the surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Completion Date. The
Post Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—We may be
_unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_
On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and to certain significant limitations under Italian law,
the Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, by no later than 90 days from the earlier of (i) the Post-Completion
Merger and (ii) in the event the Post Completion Merger does not occur, the date falling fifteen months after the Completion Date (the “Cut-Off Date”), the Guarantors
(as defined herein) guarantee the Notes.
If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date and the proceeds of the Notes are deposited into the Escrow Account, as
of the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by a first-ranking security interest in the Escrow Account. On or about the Completion
Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the
Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Within 30 Business Days following the Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured on a first-ranking basis, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Post Completion Date Collateral (as defined herein). Following
the Post Completion Merger, within the terms set forth in this Offering Memorandum, the Notes will also be secured by the Post Merger Collateral (as defined herein).
In the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that the
Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Target Group Collateral (as
defined herein) within 90 days of the Cut-Off Date.
Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral (as defined herein) after the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. The Guarantees (as defined herein) and the Collateral will be subject
to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes_
_under which the Collateral will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee or the Security Agent,” “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—Security.”_
Subject to and as set forth in “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes in relation
to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to
time) (“Decree No. 239”) if the Notes are held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239, and
otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes.”
This Offering Memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and the Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants, events of
default and offering and transfer restrictions.
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof.
The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented on issue
by one or more Global Notes (as defined herein), and the Initial Purchasers expect to deliver the Notes in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and

**The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”) or the**
**laws of any other jurisdiction. In the United States, the Offering is being made only to “qualified institutional buyers” (“QIBs”) in reliance on the exemption**

the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason or for no reason and to allot

This Offering Memorandum is not an offer to sell the Notes and it is not soliciting an offer to buy any Notes in
any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale is not permitted. The distribution of this Offering Memorandum and
the offer and sale of the Notes may, in certain jurisdictions, be restricted by law. None of the Issuer, the
Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represents that this Offering Memorandum may be lawfully distributed, or
that any Notes may be lawfully offered, in compliance with any applicable registration or other requirements in

facilitating any such distribution or offering. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers shall
have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal requirements. In particular, no action has been taken by the
Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers which would permit a public offering of any Notes or distribution
of this Offering Memorandum in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, no

QIBs for informational use solely in connection with the consideration of the purchase of the Notes. Its use for

iii


-----

For the Offering, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers are relying upon exemptions from registration under the
U.S. Securities Act for offers and sales of securities which do not involve a public offering, including Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act. Prospective investors are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be relying
on the exemption from the provision of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Notes
are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. Purchasers of the Notes may not transfer or resell the
Notes except as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**The Notes and the Guarantees have not been approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and**
**Exchange Commission or any other securities commission or regulatory authority in the United States, nor**
**have the foregoing authorities approved this Offering Memorandum or confirmed the accuracy or**
**determined the adequacy of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Any representation**
**to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.**

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the European Economic
Area (the “EEA”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129 and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (each, a “Member
**State”) of the EEA. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus**
Regulation.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for
such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers has authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer
of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute
the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a “customer” within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” within the meaning of
Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

_EEA MiFID II product governance/ Professional investors and ECPs only target market_

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”)
and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Italy_**

The Offering has not been cleared by the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (“CONSOB”) (the
Italian securities exchange commission), pursuant to Italian securities legislation and will not be subject to
formal review or clearance by CONSOB. Accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered, directly or

iv


-----

indirectly nor may copies of this Offering Memorandum or any other offering circular, prospectus, form of
application, advertisement or other offering material or document relating to the Notes to be issued, may be
distributed or published in the Republic of Italy either on the primary or on the secondary market, except (a) to
qualified investors (investitori qualificati) as referred to in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; or (b) in any
other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of the
Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter, first paragraph, letter (b) of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of

**NOTICE TO UK INVESTORS**

**_Prohibition of Sales to Certain UK Investors_**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”) (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of
the UK Prospectus Regulation.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the UK of the Notes should only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for
such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers has authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer
of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute
the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client,” as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a “customer” within the meaning of the provisions
of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as
defined in Article 2(e) of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required
by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK**
has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to, and is only directed at, persons who (i) are outside the
UK, (ii) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the

v


-----

Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended, (the “Financial
**Promotion Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies,**
unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with
the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all such persons together being referred
to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted
on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons. This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by the Financial Conduct Authority or any other
competent authority. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering
Memorandum or any of its contents.

**_UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only ECPs, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**NOTICE TO SWISS INVESTORS**

The Offering in Switzerland is exempt from the requirement to prepare and publish a prospectus under the Swiss
Financial Services Act (“FinSA”) because the Notes have a minimum denomination of CHF 100,000 (or
equivalent in another currency) or more, and further because the Notes qualify as money market instruments.

The Notes have not been and will not be listed or admitted to trading on a trading venue (i.e. exchange or
multilateral trading facility) in Switzerland. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute a prospectus
pursuant to the FinSA, and no such prospectus has been or will be prepared for or in connection with the
Offering.

“structured product” as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) (the
“SFO”) other than (i) to “professional investors” as defined in the SFO and any rules made thereunder; or (ii) in
other circumstances which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” as defined in the Companies
(Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong) (the “CO”) or which do
not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the CO. No advertisement, invitation or document
relating to the Notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each
case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed
or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong Kong) other than with
respect to Notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to
“professional investors” as defined in the SFO and any rules made thereunder.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitations, statements
about our markets and our strategy, future operations, industry forecasts and expected investments. Forwardlooking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking
statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other
statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “target” or
similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements,
but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on
potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or
implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled “Risk
_Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-_
looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative
of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary
from projected future results include, but are not limited to:

 - adverse macroeconomic conditions and economic downturns, particularly in Italy;

 - the impact of COVID-19 and related risks;

 - competition from established companies as well as local specialized competitors;

 - economic and political risks in the emerging markets in which we operate;

 - increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations, especially in regards to the environment;

 - our ability to successfully maintain EHS policies and procedures;

 - our ability to obtain, renew or comply with the terms of the licenses, authorizations and permits required for
our operations, and to develop and operate our facilities in compliance with conditions imposed by local
governments;

 - operational, health and safety risks;

 - compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to our products and raw materials;

 - potential liabilities in connection with environmental matters;

 - changes in waste disposal patterns and commodity prices;

 - our ability to retain and renew existing contracts and to win new contracts;

 - the reputation of, and value associated with, our brand;

 - unforeseen integration obstacles or costs of acquired businesses;

 - counterparty risks and delayed payments or non-payments by our customers;

 - our ability to keep pace with technological, regulatory and market developments;

 - the incentives mechanisms provided by CONOU and its supply of waste oil;

 - the development of the electric vehicle market and renewable fuel technologies;

 - our ability to continue to retain and attract highly skilled employees;

 - third party infringement on our intellectual property rights;

 - our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls;

 - labor disputes and/or work stoppages;

 - security breaches of or damage to our IT systems;

 - more stringent regulations in the area of data privacy;

 - fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

 - market perceptions concerning the stability of the euro;

-----

 - tax and social security audits;

 - the potential impact of litigation;

 - ownership of our vehicle fleet and equipment;

 - the adequacy of our insurance coverage and the cost thereof;

 - anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs;

 - liabilities associated with our directors, employees or other agents;

 - changes to the corporate tax system;

 - other risks associated with our financial information, the Transactions, our structure, the Financing, the
Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral; and

 - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

Accordingly, prospective investors should not rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum or as otherwise indicated. We do not have any obligation to publicly
revise any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of such forward-looking
statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

In addition, from time to time we and our representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have
made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be
included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and
other communications. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements
are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

The factors listed above and the other risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum
are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict
all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**General**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer is a holding company which was indirectly acquired by Itelyum Co-investment LP on August 3, 2021
for the purpose of the Acquisition. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has no revenuegenerating activities of its own, it has not been involved in any operating activity since its incorporation and does
not hold any material assets or liabilities. After the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will
not have any subsidiaries and will have no assets (other than the proceeds of the offering of the Notes which will
be deposited into the Escrow Account and will be pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Notes if the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date). The
Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities upon the Completion Date are expected to be its equity interests in the
Target and its outstanding indebtedness and inter-company balances incurred in connection with the
Transactions, including its receivables under the Itelyum Proceeds Loans and its indebtedness under the Notes
and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, if any. As a result, this Offering Memorandum does not present
any financial information of the Issuer, except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data presented on a
consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions on a pro forma basis. Prior to the Post
Completion Merger, the Issuer is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the
Transactions and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture.

**_Target Group_**

The historical financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is the consolidated financial
information of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Target Group”). Accordingly, unless otherwise
stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this
Offering Memorandum are to the Target Group on a consolidated basis. The historical financial information of
the Target Group included in this Offering Memorandum has been extracted or derived from:

(i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (the “Audited Financial Statements”); and

(ii) the unaudited half-yearly condensed consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the
six months ended June 30, 2021, which include unaudited comparative financial data for the six months
ended June 30, 2020 (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited
Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The Audited Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Italian laws governing the preparation of
financial statements, as interpreted and integrated by the accounting principles established by the Organismo
_Italiano di Contabilità—OIC (“Italian GAAP”), and the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements have been_
prepared in accordance with OIC 30, “Interim Financial Reporting,” the Italian accounting standard that governs
the preparation of interim financial statements. Our Audited Financial Statements have been audited by
Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. (“Deloitte”). In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain line items
were reclassified and renamed in order to render them more easily comparable to the financial information of
companies that apply IFRS.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering and the
financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Prospective investors should consult their
professional advisors for an understanding of (i) the differences between Italian GAAP, IFRS and other systems
of generally accepted accounting principles and how these differences might affect the financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, Italian
GAAP principles, or the adoption of IFRS principles, may have on our results of operations and/or financial
condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. See “Annex A—Summary of Certain Differences
_between Italian GAAP and IFRS.”_

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Italian GAAP requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions
and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical
_Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates.”_

-----

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income
statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments
to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer (prior to the completion of the Post Completion
Merger) and MergerCo (following the completion of the Post Completion Merger), as applicable, will account
for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under Italian GAAP and will apply purchase
accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods
subsequent to the Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying
values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our balance sheet, which may
include, inter alia, intangible assets, such as goodwill. We may also recognize different amortization and
depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, especially if we decide to provide
consolidated financial statements for periods after the Completion Date at the level of the Issuer or (following the
Post Completion Merger) MergerCo (instead of the Target), our future financial statements could be materially
different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations.”_

**Unaudited Financial Information for the Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2021**

The unaudited consolidated financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021
presented in this Offering Memorandum is calculated by adding each relevant income statement line item for the
six months ended June 30, 2021 to the corresponding income statement line item for the full year ended
December 31, 2020 and subtracting from such sum the corresponding income statement line item for the six
months ended June 30, 2020. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum,
is not prepared in the ordinary course of the Target Group’s financial reporting and has not been audited or
reviewed by the Target Group’s independent auditors.

**Impact of Bolt-on Acquisitions Made By the Itelyum Group**

Our operating results and their comparability for the historical periods covered by the Consolidated Financial
Statements are impacted by the effects of the bolt-on acquisitions of several companies acquired by the Itelyum
Group in such periods (collectively, the “Acquired Companies”). Between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021,
we acquired controlling stakes in or the entire share capital of ten companies (excluding the transactions where
we only increased our stake in previously acquired companies and companies that were already controlled by the
acquired companies). In particular, we made five such acquisitions in 2018 and five in 2020. Due to the changes
in our scope of consolidation as a consequence of each of such acquisitions, our results of operations reflected in
the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods under review may not be entirely comparable. For further
information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of_
_Operations—Bolt-on acquisitions.”_

**Perimeter Adjusted Financial Data**

We have prepared certain perimeter adjusted financial data in this Offering Memorandum, including Unaudited
_Pro forma Financial Data, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma revenue and adjusted_
recurring capital expenditure.

Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data, Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma revenue and adjusted recurring capital
expenditure provide more granularity regarding the performance of our business after adjusting for additions to
our scope of consolidation, assuming that the Acquired Companies had been part of our consolidation perimeter
since January 1, 2018. The Acquired Companies are companies we acquired in the period between January 1,
2018 and June 30, 2021 and, therefore, do not include Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021. No
reconciliation has been provided in this Offering Memorandum from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data to
the Target Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial
_Information and Other Data—Other Financial Data” and “—Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data.”_

This Offering Memorandum also contains management estimates in the calculation of our Pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA and pro forma revenue with respect to the additional Adjusted EBITDA and revenue, respectively, we
expect to generate from the acquisition of Castiglia. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other
_Data—Other Pro forma Financial Data” and “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.”_

-----

While we believe that this perimeter adjusted financial data can be useful to potential investors seeking to
evaluate our performance over time, such financial data is not intended to be compliant with Italian GAAP or any
other accounting standards. Such perimeter adjusted financial data has been prepared by, and is the responsibility
of, management. Our independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures
with respect to the perimeter adjusted financial data for the purpose of their inclusion in this Offering
Memorandum. The perimeter adjusted financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the published
guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines published by any other regulatory or industry body regarding estimates, the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

The perimeter adjusted financial data is based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to
inherent uncertainties and you are strongly cautioned against placing undue reliance thereon. The preparation of
the perimeter adjusted financial data requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions with
respect to issues such as the reconciliation of accounting policies (such as in respect of revenue recognition). For
these reasons, the perimeter adjusted financial data is only a simulation of the Itelyum Group’s results had the
relevant acquired businesses been owned for the whole period assumed and is not an indication of what our
results would have been if the relevant acquired businesses had been part of the Target Group for such period.
The perimeter adjusted financial data is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks
and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially had the relevant acquired businesses
been owned for the entire period and there are significant differences between the perimeter adjusted financial
data and the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We did not own or control the Acquired Companies prior to the dates on which control passed in accordance with
the relevant acquisition agreements. In some cases, such Acquired Companies were not operated as standalone
businesses and therefore certain allocation of headquarters and similar costs have been estimated. Additionally,
upon taking control of the Acquired Companies, we implemented our own industrial and distribution strategy
which in some cases may have differed in material ways from the prior owners’ strategy.

In addition, the pro forma adjustment relating to the impact of the acquisition of Castiglia used to calculate Pro
_forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on the information available to us in connection with the acquisition of_
Castiglia, together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. Such adjustment is inherently uncertain
and subject to a wide variety of significant uncertainties. Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur
to, among other things, integrate Castiglia into the Target Group or any potential synergies or other impacts
related to or expected to derive from the acquisition of Castiglia, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what
the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of Castiglia would have been for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, if
we had acquired Castiglia on July 1, 2020. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated results will
be realized.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Information—The perimeter adjusted financial data included
_in this Offering Memorandum, including Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, is for information_
_purposes only, is only intended to simulate what our results of operations would have been had the relevant_
_acquired businesses been included in our scope of consolidation for the entire period assumed and has been_
_prepared on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions which we consider reasonable, but it is not a_
_substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.”_

**As Adjusted Financial Information for the Transactions**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information on an adjusted basis, to give pro forma
effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on June 30, 2021 for the as adjusted balance sheet
information and on July 1, 2020 for the as adjusted income statement information. For a description of the pro
_forma effect of the Transactions, including the issuance of the Notes offered hereby and the application of the_
proceeds therefrom, see “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Pro forma
_Financial Data,” “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds.” Such as adjusted financial information is based on_
available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ from
actual amounts. It is for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what our results or other
metric would actually have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates presented or to project our results of
operations or financial position for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. This as
adjusted information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the
U.S. Exchange Act, the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted
accounting principles, including U.S. GAAP, IFRS and Italian GAAP. The independent auditors of the Target

Group have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the adjustments nor the
resulting as adjusted financial information. The as adjusted information should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by Italian GAAP or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the
Consolidated Financial Statements or notes thereto, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact), Pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, pro forma revenue, net working capital, adjusted recurring
capital expenditure, adjusted operating cash flow and cash flow conversion rate (collectively, the “Non-GAAP
**Measures”). We use such measures to assess the financial performance and liquidity of our business. We believe**
that these and similar measures are used widely by the investment community, securities analysts and other
interested parties, as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the
analysis of our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt.

An explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-GAAP Measures, a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP
Measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with Italian GAAP
and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Historical Financial
_Information and Other Data.” We do not regard these Non-GAAP Measures as a substitute for, or superior to,_
the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with Italian GAAP or other generally accepted
accounting principles or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with Italian
GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles.

Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows:

    - “EBITDA” is defined as profit (loss) for the period excluding income taxes, financial income, financial
expenses and depreciation and amortization.

    - “EBITDA margin” is defined as EBITDA for the relevant period divided by revenue for the same
period.

    - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA for the relevant period, adjusted for the CONOU
regeneration treatment fee normalization, extraordinary provision for environmental liabilities, IAS 17
leases normalization, one-off costs and expenses relating to acquisitions and mergers, other one-off
items and perimeter adjustments. For additional information, see “Summary Historical Financial and
_Other Data—Other Financial Data.”_

    - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period divided by pro
_forma revenue for the same period._

    - “Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact)” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for
the relevant period, further adjusted for normalized COVID-19 impact. Adjusted EBITDA (including
normalized COVID-19 impact) is identical to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods under review other
than for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2020.

    - “Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2021, further adjusted to give pro forma effect to the acquisition of Castiglia as if it occurred
on July 1, 2020. For additional information, see “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data—
_Other Pro forma Financial Data.”_

    - “Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro
_forma revenue (including Castiglia revenue)._

    - “pro forma revenue” is defined as revenue for the relevant period, adjusted to give pro forma effect to
the acquisitions of the Acquired Companies as if each of the Acquired Companies had been acquired
on January 1, 2018, instead of their actual respective acquisition dates, which has been derived from
the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data. Pro forma revenue for the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, has been further adjusted to give pro forma effect to the acquisition of Castiglia as if it occurred
on July 1, 2020. For additional information, see “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data—
_Other Financial Data,” “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data—Other Pro forma Financial_
_Data” and “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data—Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data.”_

    - “net working capital” is defined as the sum of trade receivables, inventories, trade payables, accrued
income and prepaid expenses, accrued expense and deferred income and other current assets and other
current liabilities.

    - “adjusted recurring capital expenditure” is defined as additions in property, plant and equipment
and additions in other intangible assets, minus extraordinary capital expenditure and growth capital
expenditure, and taking into account perimeter adjustments.

    - “adjusted operating cash flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19
impact) for the relevant period less adjusted recurring capital expenditure.

    - “cash flow conversion rate” is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating cash flow to Adjusted
EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact).

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such
as depreciation and amortization, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation
positions or regimes, we believe EBITDA-based measures and other Non-GAAP Measures can provide a useful
additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. For these
reasons, we believe EBITDA-based measures and other Non-GAAP Measures are regularly used by the
investment community as a means of comparison of companies in our industry.

Different companies and analysts may calculate EBITDA-based measures and other Non-GAAP Measures
differently, so comparisons among companies on this basis should be done carefully. EBITDA-based measures
and other Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance under Italian GAAP and should not be
considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for operating profit or net profit as an indicator of our
operations in accordance with Italian GAAP.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under Italian GAAP
or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to
performance measures derived in accordance with Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting
principles. Each of our Non-GAAP Measures is defined and reconciled to its closest comparable Italian GAAP
measure under “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.” Our Non-GAAP Measures may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under
Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Some of the limitations of Non-GAAP
Measures are that:

    - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

    - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
income statement;

    - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

    - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

    - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do,

**Overview**

We are a leading European circular economy player specialized in the collection, management and
recycling of complex streams of waste, with a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities of
industrial hazardous waste. Leveraging upon our distinctive chemical and recycling competences across
our business units, we provide circular economy solutions to a wide and diversified client base across a
variety of industries, including the automotive and pharmaceutical industries. Our mission is to act as a
one-stop shop across all value chain steps for the industrial waste streams, with particular focus on
recycling and regeneration activities.

Our services include the collection of waste, preliminary sorting and storage of waste, second level
treatment of wastewater and oil emulsions, the preparation of waste for energy recovery or any other final
destination plant through specific and specialized chemical treatments, waste oil re-refining (or
regeneration) and waste solvent purification. Our products include lubricant-based oils, bitumen additives
and gas oil, as well as a wide range of complex recovered waste-based thinners, solvent from waste and
pure solvents. We also provide environmental consulting and chemical analysis services in respect of
different types of matrices (e.g., water, soil and air) through our in-house network of accredited
laboratories, and offer complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and
non-hazardous special waste and solvents.

We are the leader in the Italian oil regeneration industry, with an approximately 89% market share as of
December 31, 2019, and one of the market leaders in Europe by oil regeneration volumes, with a 15%
market share (measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output as of December 31, 2019). We are
also the leader in the Italian waste solvent purification industry, with a 50% market share by revenue and
an approximately 37% market share by production capacity as of December 31, 2019, and in the pure
aliphatics segment in Europe, with a 34% market share as of December 2019. In addition, we managed
approximately 6% of the total volume of hazardous waste in Italy in 2019 through our Environment
business unit.

The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and
benefits from higher barriers to entry compared to the industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste
markets due to strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical skills required for the waste
management processes. Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has
demonstrated a high level of profitability and resiliency, including during periods of economic difficulties,
recording a CAGR of approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014 compared to a negative CAGR
registered by the Italian GDP over the same period.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma
Adjusted EBITDA of €406.1 million, €85.0 million and €92.0 million, respectively.

We have a large, diversified and established customer base comprising approximately 30,000 customers,
ranging from large corporates to family-owned SMEs. We have long-standing relationships with the large
majority of our top 20 customers, in certain cases spanning over a decade. For the twelve months ended
June 30, 2021, our top 20 customers (excluding CONOU) accounted for 23.6% of our revenue. Our
customers include oil companies and blenders, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, including blue
chip brands such as Eni, Total, Petronas, Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi. While all of our operating sites
are located in Italy, we benefit from a global commercial reach, serving over 60 countries through a


1


-----

network of local distributors. We have a strong geographical footprint in Italy, especially in its Northern
regions. We currently operate 12 waste storage sites and 13 waste treatment and recycling facilities,
including four plants for industrial wastewater treatment, two plants for lubricant oil regeneration, two
plants for purification and blending of solvents and five treatment and pre-treatment plants. We have
approximately 800 full-time employees (accounting for the acquisition of Castiglia in July 2021).

We offer our products and services through three business units:

 - **Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a**
comprehensive range of environmental services, mostly in hazardous waste management and, to a
lesser extent, in non-hazardous waste management covering a broad spectrum of the value chain, with
an emphasis on recycling and recovery activities. Our Environment portfolio includes sustainable
services and solutions for the industrial waste market such as (i) collection, transportation, first level
treatment and storage, (ii) consulting services and laboratory analysis carried out through our network
of ten accredited laboratories, (iii) industrial wastewater treatment and (iv) solid waste treatment. In
addition, we offer complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and
non-hazardous special waste. Our exposure to third-party-operated landfills and incinerators is
limited, accounting for approximately 12% of the total volume of our end-of-waste destinations for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Environment business unit were €143.5 million and
€29.6 million, respectively, representing 35.3% and 34.8%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA.

 - **Regeneration. Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the**
production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process that transforms waste
oil, a hazardous waste, into a valuable product. Our used oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and
Ceccano primarily produce regenerated lubricant bases and, to a lesser extent, diesel oil and other
by-products. We believe that the high quality and price competitiveness of our regenerated lubricant
bases (comparable to virgin oils), underpinned by our proprietary re-refining technology enabling the
Group to process a wide spectrum of feedstock qualities, represents a strong competitive advantage
over many of our competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA generated by our Regeneration business unit were €117.8 million and €34.5 million,
respectively, representing 29.0% and 40.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

 - **Purification. Our Purification business unit comprises the production and sale of a variety of solvents**
derived both from the valorization of chemical waste, including thinners and solvents from waste
(“SFW”), and virgin raw materials, including pure aliphatics. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Purification business unit were €144.8 million
and €20.9 million, respectively, representing 35.7% and 24.6%, respectively, of our revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA.

The following charts set forth our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA breakdown by business unit for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

We believe that the breadth of the services we offer and products we produce through our business units
has enabled us to build a significant competitive advantage within the Italian waste management market,
establishing our position as a leading one-stop shop service provider of circular economy solutions for a
wide range of customers across various industries. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we directly
managed approximately 837 thousand tons of waste materials, primarily consisting of lubricant oil,
solvents, industrial hazardous water, waste treatment for energy valorization and other waste (excluding
intermediated waste), with hazardous and non-hazardous waste accounting for 71% and 29%, respectively,
of these volumes, and solid and liquid waste accounting for 19% and 81%, respectively, of these volumes.
For the same period, we managed and processed approximately 1,174 thousand tons of waste (including
intermediated waste). The following charts set forth the breakdown of waste volumes treated by us for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

**_Front-runner in the circular economy solutions market, with distinctive competences in industrial_**
**_hazardous waste recycling_**

We act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps for the industrial waste streams through our
proprietary technologies and a strong network of partners for specific types of waste. We have a distinctive
focus on recycling and regeneration activities that enable us to offer circular solutions underpinned by the
use of recycled products as industrial inputs. Our integrated platform: (i) drives significant commercial
synergies across our business units, particularly in relation to sale channels, distributions and technological
solutions; (ii) reinforces our value proposition to customers by covering a broad spectrum of waste
management services; (iii) enables vertical integration by securing a steady supply of waste; (iv) facilitates
centralized procurement efforts and capital expenditure optimization; (v) reduces transportation costs
through fleet and route optimization; and (vi) drives efficiencies in our operations through the sharing of
proprietary technologies and best practices. In addition, our scale and organizational structure often give us
a competitive advantage over smaller players who may experience difficulties complying with increasingly
stringent regulations. This is particularly the case of regulations imposing strict obligations on waste
producers in relation to the waste cycle from collection to end-of-waste destinations. In these instances,


3


-----

structured players like us are able to provide customers with enhanced regulatory certainty and reduced
compliance risks. The graphic below sets out our positioning across the waste management value chain for
each relevant industry.

We are at the forefront of the circular economy model. The integrated nature of our platform and the
circularity of our business model enable us to provide sustainable solutions across our three business units.
Supported by strong technological and operational competencies, we are able to extract value out of
industrial waste for the production of sustainable products and resources. For the year ended December 31,
2020, approximately 88%, 95% and 95% of the waste we managed in the Environment, Regeneration and
Purification business units, respectively, was transformed into products, returned to the environment as
purified water or sent to energy recovery, resulting in an overall circularity index of approximately 90%.
Over this period, (i) within our Environment business unit, 48% of the waste managed was sent to
recovery, 27% of the waste managed underwent water treatment, 13% of the waste managed underwent oil
emulsion treatment and 12% of the waste managed was sent to other destinations, (ii) within our
Regeneration business unit, 66%, 14%, 8% and 7% of lubricant oils processed were used to produce
lubricant bases, bitumen additives, water and gas oil, respectively, while we outsourced 4% and 1% of
lubricant oils processed for disposal and recovery, respectively, and (iii) within our Purification business
unit, 60%, 25% and 10% of industrial streams and virgin raw materials processed were used to produce
SFW, pure solvents from virgin raw materials and purified water, respectively, while we outsourced 4%
and 1% of the materials processed for disposal and recovery, respectively. The remaining portion of the
waste is delivered to third-party landfill sites and incinerators. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 72%
of waste collected was internally treated (including waste oil for our Regeneration business unit), 13% was
internally pre-treated and 16% was collected for sorting and storage. Our Regeneration business solutions
enable us to reduce the impact on the environment compared to primary production, resulting in a
reduction of approximately 90% in the consumption of fossil fuel resources, an approximately 200%
reduction in CO2 emissions, an approximately 400% reduction in emissions of fine dusts and an
approximately 500% reduction in the emission of acidifying substances (NOx, SO2 and NH3), in each case
as compared to primary production. Furthermore, our Purification business solutions significantly reduce
the impact of solvent recycling compared to primary production, resulting in an approximately 1,000%
reduction in CO2 emissions.

In addition, our integrated platform enables us to benefit from solid and attractive market dynamics,
leveraging upon the ongoing regulatory shift from a “linear economy” in favor of a “circular economy.”
We benefit from favorable regulation within the EU and Italy on waste treatment and used oil regeneration.
Further to the enactment of EU Directive 2008/98/EC (supplemented by EU Directive 2018/850), the EU
required member states to significantly reduce waste disposal in favor of recycling, by establishing a
specific waste management hierarchy. Italy implemented the EU-prescribed waste hierarchy through
national legislation and set up a system of recycling authorizations, imposing stringent restrictions on
authorized production capacity for special waste that has reinforced our market position by creating high


4


-----

entry barriers. In addition, these stringent regulatory requirements are enablers of our strong market
position as waste producers are incentivized to rely on our advanced recycling and waste management
solutions as a way of managing high compliance and regulatory costs relating to the disposal and treatment
of industrial waste, including risks of economic penalties and criminal sanctions. The graphic below
presents our advantageous position across the waste management hierarchy.

Furthermore, our Regeneration business benefits from the favorable regulatory framework established in
Italy, one of the most virtuous countries in Europe in terms of collection and regeneration of used oil,
where regenerated lubricant oil accounted for 99% of collected volumes in Italy in 2019, compared to an
average of 51% in the EU over the same period. We benefit from incentive mechanisms established by
CONOU (Consorzio nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e trattamento degli oli minerali usati), a private
Italian consortium, to support our Regeneration business. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is
inversely correlated to the market price of lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lubricant
oil market price and vice versa, although in no event, such as instances of high lubricant oil market prices,
does the incentive mechanism require us to pay a regeneration treatment fee to CONOU), ensures that we
have downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lubricant oil prices and supports a minimum
profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products, under normal circumstances. This framework
has been in place for over ten years and has also been subject to modifications favorable for oil
regeneration companies over the years to better reflect market dynamics and support collection and
regeneration activities. In particular, based on the latest amendment in October 2020, the regeneration
treatment fee is no longer subject to a set cap that historically limited the amount of compensation granted
to oil regeneration companies during periods of significantly low oil prices, such as in the first halves of
2016 and 2020; therefore supporting a profitability floor even in significantly unfavorable oil price
scenarios. We expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after December 2024,
except in exceptional circumstances indicated in the CONOU Operating Regulation which, in any event,
cannot be retroactive. We estimate that the removal of the set cap as well as other amendments to the
formula, on a pro forma basis for the year 2020, would have had an estimated positive impact of
€1.9 million on our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The quality and breadth of our role as a circular economy player enabled us to achieve a strong market
position in Italy, where we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of hazardous waste through our
Environment business unit for the year ended December 31, 2019. Given the highly fragmented nature of
the hazardous waste management market in Italy, we were the second largest company by volume over the
same period, with the leading company accounting for approximately 7% of the total volume of hazardous
waste. In addition, we are the number one player in the Italian oil regeneration space, with an


5


-----

approximately 89% market share as of December 31, 2019, and a market leader in Europe in terms of oil
regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output in
2019. We are also the leading company in the Italian waste solvent purification space, with a 50% market
share by revenue, and the largest European player by capacity in 2019, with an approximately 37% share of
the Italian market.

**_Leadership position in defensive and profitable markets, benefiting from high entry barriers_**

We operate in markets characterized by high barriers to entry. The industrial hazardous waste market in
Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits from higher barriers to entry
compared to industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste due to strict regulatory approvals and more
advanced technical skills required for the waste management processes. Supported by these features, the
industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has shown profitability and resiliency during periods of
economic difficulties, recording a CAGR of approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014, compared to a
negative CAGR of 2.2% and a CAGR of 0.2% during the same period for the Italian urban waste market
and non-hazardous waste market, respectively, and a negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP over
the same period. The resilience of our business in a challenging macro-economic environment was also
displayed by our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 when despite the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, our revenue remained relatively flat as compared to 2019, on a like-for-like basis.

Leveraging upon our strong and strategic local presence, especially in the most industrialized areas of Italy,
we believe that our Environment business unit is advantageously positioned as a one-stop shop for
producers of hazardous waste, alongside our Regeneration and Purification business units. We believe that
our longstanding experience with hazardous waste, highly skilled staff and advanced waste management
plants give us a strong competitive advantage over national competitors. In addition, the complexity of the
authorization, certification, compliance and operational requirements in the waste management industry
(especially with regard to the hazardous waste market), along with our geographical proximity to
customers, also serve as natural barriers to entry.

Through our Regeneration business unit, we hold a market leading position in Italy. We held
approximately 89% of the market share of the Italian oil regeneration market by volume in 2019, and we
are a leading company in Europe in terms of oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share measured
by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output in 2019. We believe that our economies of scale, proprietary
technologies and contracted waste streams, also in light of the CONOU framework, provide us with a
strong competitive advantage. Furthermore, the Italian used oil regeneration market requires significant
upfront investment and is also characterized by complex authorization, certification and operational
requirements, which serve as additional barriers to entry.

Our Purification business has the largest installed capacity in the European waste solvent purification
industry, at approximately 100 thousand tons per year, and we held 50% of the market share of the Italian
waste solvent purification market by revenue in 2019. Reinforced by our circular partnership and
established relationships with leading players in the pharmaceutical sector, we have also built strong
positions in international end-markets, including leading positions in the waste-based thinner segments in
Africa and the Middle East (with a market share of 38% and 37% by volumes, respectively, in 2019) and in
the pure aliphatics segment in Europe (with a 34% market share in 2019). We believe that our economies
of scale, know-how, proprietary technologies and long-term partnerships with a loyal customer base have
enabled our Purification business unit to secure and maintain market leading positions in Italy and Europe.
In addition, the Italian solvent purification market is characterized by high barriers to entry, underpinned
by requirements for significant upfront investment and the complexity of the authorization, certification,
compliance and operational processes.

We believe our competitors’ limited ability to replicate our business model also resides in our advanced
R&D capabilities across our business units. Over the years, we have internalized value-adding processes,
and developed products and waste treatment methods in partnership with our customers. This has created
an intangible barrier, which does not solely rely on commercial relationships, but on years of expertise
matured in close collaboration with our customers (such as, for example, our collaboration with API
producers for the joint development of formulas for waste optimization in our Purification business unit).
Furthermore, our ability to produce high-purity aliphatic solvents from virgin materials, combined with our


6


-----

trading activities relating to these products, allows us to establish increasingly solid and synergistic
relationships with our customers and present our Purification business unit as a one-stop shop for highpurity aliphatic solvents. Our Purification business unit benefits from an authorized capacity for the
production of non-waste finished products, such as virgin materials, of additional 100 thousand tons per
year.

**_State-of-the-art plants and well-proven proprietary technology_**

We operate 13 waste treatment and recycling facilities in Italy and 12 waste storage sites. Our strong
geographical footprint and the density of our operational network in Northern Italy, especially in the
Northern regions of Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna, allow us to
benefit from economies of scale in managing complex logistics and the input sourcing reach of our
production. These factors also improve our efficiency by minimizing the logistical burden and costs of
transporting our raw materials to our facilities. In addition, our wide-reaching asset base enables
geographical proximity to our customer base and ensures extensive coverage of the Italian market. Set forth
below is a chart representing the location of our waste management sites as of June 30, 2021.

We also operate two stand-alone laboratories for chemical and environmental analysis. Supported by a
network of 18 waste management companies, our Environment business has an overall authorized capacity
of approximately 900 thousand tons per year. Approximately 559 thousand tons of waste were processed
through the waste storage and treatment plants of our Environment business unit for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021, while additional 338 thousand tons were sold through the trading activities of our
Environment business unit during the same period. Underpinned by over 50 years of experience in the
production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process, our Regeneration plants in
Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano have a combined treatment capacity of 214 thousand tons per year.
Approximately 184 thousand tons of used oil were processed through our oil regeneration plants for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our Purification business unit comprises two plants for purification
and blending of solvents with an authorized capacity of 99 thousand tons per year for solvent and chemical
purification deriving from waste, 100 thousand tons per year for solvent purification (e.g., for virgin
materials) and chemical synthesis and 75 thousand tons per year for our blending plant in Rho, near Milan.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we treated 94 thousand tons for solvent and chemical


7


-----

purification deriving from waste (of which 57 thousand tons were subsequently blended and packed in our
blending plant as well) and we treated 38 thousand tons for solvent purification (e.g., for virgin materials)
and chemical synthesis.

In connection with our waste management operations, we also own and maintain a fleet of more than 120
collection trucks and other industrial vehicles. Our fleet helps secure the waste we collect, allows us to
adapt to individual client needs, improves our service offering and makes regulatory compliance easier,
particularly regarding the different transportation requirements for specific types of waste.

Our state-of-the-art plants, extensive chemical know-how, designed industrial processes and proprietary
technologies, underpinned by 14 registered patents, allow us to act as a one-stop shop across all value chain
steps for industrial waste streams. Our Regeneration business benefits from a patented proprietary process
for the productions of lubricant bases, which is now widely used by leading lubrication companies
worldwide. See also “Business—Research & Development, Technology and Innovation.”

In addition, we seek continuous technological improvement by leveraging upon several established
partnerships with leading Italian universities.

**_Highly resilient business with outstanding growth backed by diversified revenues streams, solid_**
**_profitability and cash generation_**

The strengths described above, coupled with attractive industry fundamentals, have enabled us to deliver
strong and consistent financial performance. The solid relationships with our clients, their end-market
diversification, along with the pricing stability levers inherent in our business, have allowed us to build a
resilient business model with high visibility over revenue and profitability performance and operating cash
generation. Anticipated structural growth in our end-markets (with an estimated CAGR of approximately
7% in the Italian hazardous waste market over the period 2021-2025), supported by structural imbalance
between demand and supply, high switching costs for our customers and our entrenched presence in the
most densely industrialized regions of Italy, are expected to generate premium economics in our business
units. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of
lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), provides our
Regeneration segment with downside protection against periods of low prices of crude oil and lubricant oil
and supports a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products. The chart below
shows the resilience of our Regeneration business unit despite fluctuations of oil prices over the period
2018-2020.

Since 2018, we have achieved revenue and profitability growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions.
Our revenue increased by 18.5%, from €279.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to
€330.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our EBITDA increased by 11.1%, from
€45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €50.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2020. In addition to being a highly cash generative business,


8


-----

we have limited capital expenditure requirements, with our adjusted recurring capital expenditure being
equivalent to less than 3% of our revenue on average over the period from 2018 to 2020.

The resilience of our business model was underscored during the year ended December 31, 2020, when
despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
margin on a constant perimeter basis remained broadly in line with results recorded during the year ended
December 31, 2019 and with two of our three business units (i.e., Environment and Purification) delivering
growth.

Furthermore, while our operating sites and plants are exclusively based in Italy, we benefit from a large
international commercial footprint underpinned by a strong network of international distributors acting
locally within key jurisdictions worldwide, which enables us to geographically diversify our revenue
streams. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, 21.1% of our revenue was generated abroad in over
60 countries. The graphic below presents the breadth of our international commercial footprint.

**_ESG-centric corporate mission, making sustainability the cornerstone of an advanced circular economy_**
**_model_**

Sustainability is at the core of our corporate mission. Our business model is focused on maximizing (i) the
use of recycled raw materials, (ii) the transformation efficiency of industrial processes and (iii) the most
sustainable destinations for generated waste. Our business model is underpinned by robust Environmental,
Social and Governance (“ESG”) programs, with the circularity index of our business standing at
approximately 90%. We have prepared an annual Sustainability Report for the last 15 years and constantly
track ESG metrics. We have introduced a Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”) in 2020 to serve as
the cornerstone of sustainability management within the Itelyum Group, being tasked with reviewing and
updating our sustainability strategies, verifying the state of implementation of our initiatives and deploying
operational mandates to our group companies. The SSC is chaired by an independent and highly reputable
advisor and comprises the members of our board of directors and the Chief Sustainability Officer. For the
year ended December 31, 2020, we avoided the generation of approximately 470 thousand tons of CO2
necessary for the production of virgin products substituted by recycled products and one thousand tons of
air pollutants, generated annual savings of approximately 14 million cubic meters of water and avoided the
consumption of 400 hectares of land. We promote self-production of electricity and partially rely on the
electricity generated by our three photovoltaic plants, with an installed capacity of over 800 kilowatts, and
our high-efficiency cogeneration plant, with an average production capacity of over 46 million kilowatthours, to sustain our operations. In addition, in accordance with our newly established Sustainability
Performance Targets, we aim to achieve (i) a 25% increase in gross CO2 avoided emissions for the year
ending December 31, 2025, compared to the baseline of 430,449.6 tons of CO2 for the year ended
December 31, 2020; and (ii) a 25% increase in the quantity of waste collected and delivered to circular
treatment for the year ending December 31, 2025, compared to the baseline of 574,184 tons of waste for


9


-----

the year ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, through our sustainability policy, we aim to contribute to
the achievement of the following nine major Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”):

We remain focused on promoting internationally recognized human rights and guaranteeing working
conditions based on equal opportunities and development of skills in a context that considers diversity as a
true source of value. We are committed to allocating considerable resources to the creation of social value
through business integrity and stakeholder relations, including through new training initiatives that propose
to increase sustainability-focused trainings for our staff from 17 hours per year per individual in 2019 to 30
hours per year per individual by 2025. We also believe that safety, protection and promotion of health and
well-being of individuals are fundamental values to be integrated in all our activities. This principle
extends to employees, companies, suppliers, visitors, local communities and any other stakeholder included
in our sphere of influence. We are committed to taking concrete measures aimed at eliminating accidents,
injuries and illnesses caused by work activities and reducing risks in all our activities. In 2020, our
frequency index risk (calculated as number of accidents (with absence from work for more than 24 hours)
per million hours of work) was 5.8.

We have also implemented strong operational risk management and compliance systems aimed at risk
prevention, and strive to continuously improve our environmental performance and management systems.
Our environmental management system is equipped with established standards and processes and is built
around the principles of ISO 45001 and ISO 14001, which certifies our commitment to sustainable
solutions and advanced health and safety standards. Most of our waste management facilities, including the
oil regeneration plants of Ceccano and Pieve Fissiraga, hold ISO 14001 certifications of compliance with
advanced environmental standards.

As a member of the United Nations Global Compact, we strive to implement the best practices in terms of
governance through internal committee monitoring, independent supervision as well as the adoption of
relevant codes, protocols and policies. Leveraging upon 13 globally recognized management systems,
reference protocols and certifications, we have implemented a formal code of ethics and an organizational,
management and control model across each of our group companies, and have also appointed an
independent supervisory board to oversee our robust governance practices. See also “Business—
_Sustainability, Environment, Social and Governance.”_

**_Experienced management team widely recognized in the industry, supported by a solid organizational_**
**_structure_**

We have an experienced senior management team providing strong leadership across all functional areas of
our business, overseen by our chief executive officer (“CEO”) who has over 20 years of experience in
leading national and international companies. With an average of more than ten years of industry
experience, our management team is aligned to execute on the Itelyum Group’s growth strategy and has a
proven track record in delivering growth and profitability by identifying profitable growth opportunities
and effective integration processes, which we believe provide us with a significant competitive advantage
over our competitors. In addition, our chairman, CEO and three senior managers on our board of directors
are members of a number of industry-recognized Italian and international associations, including
Federchimica, UNEM (Unione Energie per la Mobilità), GEIR (Groupement Européen de l’Industrie de la
_Régénération), ESRG (European Solvent Recycler Group), CONOU, COBAT (Consorzio nazionale_
_batterie esauste) and the UN Global Compact Italy._

**Our Strategy**

**_Focus on organic growth driven by promoting synergies across business units_**

We plan to drive organic growth by continuing to optimize our integrated platform across our business
units. In particular, we have launched, and expect to launch over the medium term, a number of key
initiatives aimed at unlocking commercial synergies in our end-to-end waste management solutions and
promoting cross-divisional opportunities for the optimization of waste supply and cost management.

These key initiatives include, among others: (i) leveraging on our wide Environment platform network to
reinforce the value proposition offered to our customer base across our Regeneration and Purification
business units through increased marketing, distribution and procurement synergies; (ii) securing an
optimized feedstock supply via collection integration; (iii) enhancing the sharing of technology solutions
and best practices to allow continuous improvement and operational efficiency; (iv) creating a centralized
warehouse for spare parts and maintenance team, thus reducing unexpected unavailability or operational
difficulties, in particular for our Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano oil regeneration plants; and (v) rationalizing
our vehicle fleet and optimizing routes for inbound and outbound transportation of waste and raw
materials.

**_Leverage strategic and expansion projects with highly visible financial impact to increase production_**
**_capacity, improve profitability and expand product offering_**

We plan to continue pursuing special operational projects with highly visible financial impact, especially
aimed at increasing treated and recycled waste volumes and expanding the authorized capacity of our
plants. One of these projects relates to the expansion of our waste water treatment capacity by
approximately 120 thousand tons per year, mainly relating to captive volumes generated by Temix Oleo
S.r.l. We also seek to expand our waste storage, treatment and tank capacity through expansion projects at
our existing plants.

In addition, we expect to diversify the product range of our Regeneration business unit and broaden its
client base by increasing our focus on high value-added lubricant oils. We also aim to maximize our plant
capacity by pursuing continuous technological improvements, upgrades to our production equipment and
investments in R&D projects.

Furthermore, we expect to expand the revenue generating capacity of our Purification business unit by
investing in special projects, primarily aimed at expanding capacity at our purification and blending plants
and adding new product lines to our portfolio. For example, we plan to invest approximately €17 million
over the period 2021-2025 to (i) expand the production capacity of thinners and SFW products by
increasing the production capacity of our existing plants and the acquisition of new plants and (ii) establish
new product lines for our starting material for active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”).

**_Pursue value-accretive and strategic acquisitions to expand and consolidate our platform_**

We intend to continue to deploy an acquisition strategy that focuses on acquiring and integrating small and
medium-sized regional and national businesses. Our latest acquisition, Castiglia, is headquartered in Puglia,
a region in the south of Italy, and provides integrated services for environmental protection and
sustainability with a particular focus on the management of waste deriving from water purification
processes. Through the acquisition of Castiglia, we expect to enhance our market position in the Southern
regions of Italy.

We believe that our reputation and track record in the Italian waste management market leads to us being
chosen by specialist and generalist waste management businesses as a natural market consolidator. Once an
acquisition is executed, we seek to implement a well-defined integration process that includes coordinating
administration, finance and treasury, IT, human resources and other support functions with our central
management functions, and seek to leverage our national network and commercial structure in order to
increase the waste volumes processed at the sites that are acquired.

The Italian waste management market remains highly fragmented, with more than 90% of companies that
operate in the market employing fewer than 50 full-time employees, which offers growth opportunities for


11


-----

leading players such as Itelyum. Our strong geographical footprint and diverse product portfolio create
opportunities for acquisitions that bolster our existing platform. Excluding acquisitions made in the last 24
months, we estimate that the Adjusted EBITDA of companies we acquired grew at an average CAGR of
more than 60% over the two years that followed the relevant acquisitions. We intend to selectively consider
further bolt-on or strategic acquisitions to capitalize on our competitive strengths, extend our territorial
coverage and preserve or improve our financial performance and profitability. We may seek to consolidate
our leading positioning in our core verticals or expand into new, complementary verticals. In addition, we
may in the future enter new geographies and seek to leverage our core expertise and know-how by
penetrating new European markets, such as the industrial waste management, the oil regeneration or the
pharmaceutical purification markets. We plan to continue to take a disciplined approach to evaluating
potential investments and maintain prudent overall liquidity and leverage.

**Principal Shareholders**

The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco. The ultimate controlling party of the Issuer is
Verde Holdings S.C.A., an entity whose controlling shareholder is Itelyum Co-investment LP, whose
ultimate general partner is Bay Fox Verde GP Limited.

Stirling Square Capital Partners is a London-based European private equity investment firm. Founded in
2002, the firm manages €2.5 billion of assets across four funds and a number of co-investment positions.
The firm has completed approximately 30 transactions across 13 countries in a broad range of sectors,
including specialty industrials, business services and healthcare services. In addition to the Itelyum Group,
Stirling Square Capital Partners has a strong track record of investments in Italian assets, such as
Microtecnica, Metroweb and Isoclima.

On or shortly after the Completion Date, we expect that approximately 29% and 7% of the share capital of the
Issuer will be indirectly owned by DBAG and the Management Investors, respectively, while SSCP Fund IV,
together with other SSCP-controlled co-investors, will indirectly control the remaining share capital.

DBAG is a provider of private equity for mid-sized companies across several sectors. Publicly listed since
1985, DBAG has 33 portfolio companies and approximately €2.5 billion of assets under management.

For further information, see “Principal Shareholders.”

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated and existing under the laws of Italy. The
Issuer was formed as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) on July 12, 2019, and
subsequently converted into a joint stock company (società per azioni) on September 1, 2021. The Issuer is
registered with the Companies’ register of Milan, Monza, Brianza and Lodi under registration number and
fiscal code 10911290962. The registered office of the Issuer is at Via Alessandro Manzoni n. 38, Milan, Italy.

**Sustainability-Linked Features**

Our strategic goal is to create shared value for business partners, society as a whole and the environment by
offering sustainable solutions for the regeneration of used lubricating oils, purification of solvents and
chemical waste and environmental services for the management of industrial waste.

In September 2021, we adopted a sustainability-linked bond framework (the “Sustainability-Linked Bond
**Framework”). We identified the following key performance targets, in each case calculated as set forth in**
our Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework:

    - a 25% increase in gross CO2 avoided emissions for the year ending December 31, 2025,
compared to the baseline of 430,449.6 tons of CO2 for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the
“Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target”). We believe the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions
Target provides helpful insight on the impact of our activities on CO2 emission, and is calculated
as the CO2 emissions avoided through our regenerated and purified products in substitution of
virgin ones. Our regenerated and purified products contribute to avoiding emissions, limiting the
increase of global emissions and substituting primary fossil material ones. The baseline of
430,449.6 tons of CO2 (the “CO2 Baseline”) has been calculated by the Itelyum Group in good
faith but has not been independently verified or audited by any third party; and


12


-----

    - a 25% increase in the quantity of waste collected and delivered to circular treatment for the year
ending December 31, 2025, compared to the baseline of 574,184 tons of waste for the year ended
December 31, 2020 (the “Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target” and, together with
the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target, the “Sustainability Performance Targets”). We
believe the Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target provides helpful insight on the impact
of our activities on the circular economy, and is calculated as the quantity of waste collected and
delivered to circular treatments measured in tons per year as set forth in our Sustainability-Linked
Bond Framework. Circular treatments include regeneration, recycling, waste water treatment and
recovery. The baseline of 574,184 tons of waste (the “Circular Treatment Baseline”) has been
calculated by the Itelyum Group in good faith and has been independently verified by a third party.
In this Offering Memorandum, we refer to the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target and the
Circular Treatment Baseline, collectively, as the “SLB Baselines.”

In the event the Issuer redeems the Notes pursuant to (i) the second or fifth paragraph of “Description of
_Notes—Optional Redemption” at any time on or after June 30, 2022, and/or (ii) “Description of Notes—_
_Redemption at Maturity,” and, in each case, unless the Group has met both of the Sustainability_
Performance Targets on the relevant testing date, as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee (with a copy to
the Paying Agent) in an officer’s certificate, which shall also include an Assurance Letter, on or prior to the
relevant Certification Date, the applicable Step-up Premium will be payable in connection with the
applicable redemption. For further information on the Step-Up Premium mechanics, see “Description of
_Notes—Sustainability Performance Targets Step-up Redemption Premium.”_

We intend to report annually on our performance with respect to Sustainability Performance Target for the
preceding calendar year. This report will be separate from, and in addition to, the reporting required under the
Indenture for the Notes. Our Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework can be found on our website at
http://www.itelyum.com. A second party opinion on the alignment of our Sustainability-Linked Framework
with the Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles 2020, as administered by ICMA, has been provided by the
Institutional Shareholder Services, and is available at www.iss-esg.com and on our website at
http://www.itelyum.com. Institutional Shareholder Services, a provider of environmental, social and
governance research and analysis, evaluated the terms of the Issuer’s offering of the Notes in this Offering
Memorandum and the alignment thereof with relevant industry standards and provided views on the
robustness and credibility of the Sustainability Linked Bond Framework, which views are intended to inform
investors in general, and not for a specific investor. Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Memorandum
to the contrary, neither our sustainability reports (including our Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework) nor
any other information on our website is incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—No assurance or
_representation is given by us, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion provider or any_
_External Reviewer as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of any opinion, report_

_any third party in connection with the Offering or the Sustainability Performance Targets to fulfil any green,_
_social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other criteria. The Notes are not “green bonds.” Moreover,_
_the CO2 Baseline presented herein has not been independently verified or audited by any third party. There will_
_be limited consequences under the Indenture for our failure to meet the Sustainability Performance Targets.”_

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On August 13, 2021, Verde Holdings S.C.A., an indirect holding company of the Issuer, as purchaser, entered
into a sale purchase agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with, inter alios, Stirling Square Capital Partners
Third Fund A Limited Partnership and Stirling Square Capital Partners Third Fund B Limited Partnership
(together, “SSCP Fund III”), SSCP Third Fund S. à r.l., Stirling Square Capital Partners Viscolube
Co-Investment LP (collectively with SSCP Fund III and SSCP Third Fund S. à r.l., the “SSCP Sellers”), and
certain management and other co-investors of the Itelyum Group (the “Co-Investor Sellers” and, together with
the SSCP Sellers, the “Sellers”) relating to the acquisition of all of the equity interests in the Target.

On the Completion Date, (i) the Issuer will become the direct owner of 100% of the entire issued and
outstanding share capital of the Target, (ii) SSCP Fund IV and other SSCP-controlled co-investors will
indirectly control the Target Group through Itelyum Co-Investment LP, which will indirectly own 64% of


13


-----

the share capital of the Target and (iii) certain minority investors, comprised of private investment firm
DBAG and the Management Investors, will indirectly own approximately 29% and 7%, respectively, of the
share capital of the Target. For further information, see “Principal Shareholders.”

The purchase price for the Acquisition to be paid by the Issuer to the Sellers on the Completion Date will
be €543.2 million, plus €142.5 thousand per calendar day from January 1, 2021 to and including the
Completion Date. The purchase price so calculated will be adjusted in the event the Target or any direct or
indirect parent entity of the Target pays or effects certain dividend or distribution in cash in favor of the
Sellers (collectively, the “Leakages”). As a result, the ultimate consideration under the Acquisition
Agreement will in part be dependent on the timing of the Completion Date. It is expected that part of the
consideration payable to certain management Co-Investor Sellers will be reinvested by the Co-Investor
Sellers as equity interests in the Itelyum Group pursuant to the terms of the relevant Management
Agreements (as defined below).

On September 3, 2021, we received a declaration that the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition
Agreement do not fall within the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation, from the Italian Presidency
of the Council of Ministries (Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri). As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we do not expect the finalization of the Acquisition to be subject to any further conditions
precedent.

**_The Financing_**

We expect to finance the Transactions (as defined below) through: (i) the gross proceeds from the Offering
of the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €450.0 million and (ii) an estimated €312.5 million of
shareholder funding in the form of an equity contribution to be made by SSCP Fund IV, other SSCP
co-investors and DBAG to the Issuer through intermediate holding companies on or prior to the
Completion Date (the “Equity Contribution” and, together with the Offering, the “Financing”).

The proceeds from the Financing will be used by the Issuer to:

 - fund the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement by using (x) proceeds from the
Equity Contribution, and (y) an estimated €269.6 million representing a portion of the proceeds from
Tranche A (as defined under “—Sources and Uses” below) under the Notes;

 - fund the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan by using an estimated €82.3 million representing all the
proceeds from Tranche B (as defined under “—Sources and Uses” below) under the Notes;

 - fund the Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan by using an estimated €68.1 million representing all the
proceeds from Tranche C (as defined under “—Sources and Uses” below) under the Notes; and

 - pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions, including estimated fees and
expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering, by using an estimated €30.0 million
representing a portion of the proceeds from Tranche A under the Notes.

**_The Refinancing_**

As mentioned under “—The Financing” above, a portion of the proceeds from the Offering will be used by
the Issuer to make the Itelyum Proceeds Loans. As further described under “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Itelyum Proceeds Loans,” the Itelyum Proceeds Loans are expected to be for an_
aggregate estimated principal amount of €150.4 million, deriving from the proceeds under Tranche B for
an amount of €82.3 million representing the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan and from the proceeds
under Tranche C for an amount of €68.1 million representing the Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan.

The proceeds from the Itelyum Proceeds Loans, along with cash on balance sheet of the Target Group, will
be used by each of Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification on the Completion Date or shortly
thereafter to repay, discharge and ultimately cancel all the outstanding amounts under certain existing
indebtedness of Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, respectively, consisting of (i) amounts
borrowed under the Itelyum Regeneration Senior Facilities Agreement, (ii) amounts borrowed under the
Itelyum Purification Senior Facilities Agreement, (iii) liabilities under the Vendor Loan Agreements and
(iv) certain liabilities in respect of hedging derivative instruments, for an aggregate amount of
€178.2 million (collectively, the “Existing Itelyum Debt”) (the “Refinancing”).


14


-----

On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which
provides for the €50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. We do not expect any amounts to be drawn under
the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Agreements—
_Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

We refer to the Financing, the Acquisition, the Refinancing, the entering into the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and the Settlement Agreements (as
defined under “—Recent Developments—Settlement Agremeents Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities”
below), and any actions or steps related thereto, collectively, as the “Transactions.”

**_Escrow Account_**

If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date, the Initial
Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds
from the Notes into the Escrow Account, which will be pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Notes. The release of the proceeds from escrow will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement
within one business day following the release of the funds from the Escrow Account. If the proceeds of the
Notes are deposited into the Escrow Account and the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property
have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other
events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption
price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the special mandatory
redemption date. Amounts may be released from the Escrow Account prior to the Completion Date to pay
negative interest charged on the Escrow Account (if any) and to pay interest on the Notes on any interest
payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the release of the proceeds from escrow. See
_“Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

If the gross proceeds of the Offering are not deposited into the Escrow Account on the Issue Date and the
Completion Date does not occur within one business day of the Issue Date, then, unless the Completion
Date occurs on the following business day, the Issuer will promptly either (i) redeem the Notes pursuant to
the special mandatory redemption described above in the case that (x) in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or (y) an event of
default described under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Description of Notes—
_Events of Default” with respect to the Issuer occurs or (ii) deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into_
the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

**_Sources and Uses_**

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown
in the table below. Actual amounts are subject to adjustment and may differ from estimated amounts at the
time of the consummation of the Acquisition, depending on several factors, including differences from our
estimate of fees and expenses and the timing of the Completion Date. This table should be read in
conjunction with “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

(4) Represents the estimated purchase price payable to the Sellers for the equity interests in the Target to be acquired under the
Acquisition Agreement assuming that the Completion Date will occur on September 30, 2021, to be financed by using the
proceeds from the Equity Contribution and a portion of the proceeds from virtual tranche A (“Tranche A”) under the Notes for
an estimated €269.6 million, as further described under “—The Transactions—The Financing.” The purchase price payable at the
Completion Date may differ from the amount presented, depending on the actual timing of the Completion Date and the potential
occurrence of certain Leakages, as further described under “—The Transactions—The Acquisition.”
(5) Represents the following amounts outstanding as of June 30, 2021: (i) existing indebtedness of Itelyum Regeneration under the
Itelyum Regeneration Senior Facilities Agreement, liabilities under the 2016 Vendor Loan Agreement and liabilities under certain
hedging derivative instruments, to be fully repaid and canceled via the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan with the funds
available under tranche B under the Notes (“Tranche B”) for an aggregate amount of approximately €82.3 million and cash on
balance sheet of the Target Group and; and (ii) indebtedness of Itelyum Purification under the Itelyum Purification Senior
Facilities Agreement, liabilities under the 2017 Vendor Loan Agreement and liabilities under certain hedging derivative
instruments, to be fully repaid and canceled via the Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan with the funds available under tranche C
under the Notes (“Tranche C”) for an aggregate amount of approximately €68.1 million and cash on balance sheet of the Target
Group, as further described under “—The Transactions—The Refinancing.”
(6) Represents the estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including any underwriting or discount fees and
commissions, financial advisory fees and other transaction costs and professional fees), to be financed with the proceeds from
Tranche A under the Notes. The actual amount of fees and expenses will vary from the estimated amounts depending on several
factors, including differences in the amount of fees and expenses actually incurred compared to our estimates.

For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate
portions of the proceeds from the Offering to be used by the Issuer to, consummate the Acquisition and
make the Itelyum Proceeds Loan for purposes of, inter alia, the Refinancing, and will not entail issuing
separate identifiers (ISINs or Common Codes) for each such virtual tranche under the Notes. See “Use of
_Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Notes.”_

**_Post Completion Merger_**

The Issuer intends to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or
authorization by any competent authority, to implement the Post Completion Merger in accordance with
Articles 2501-bis and following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of Italian law,
with MergerCo being the surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Completion
Date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect that Itelyum Regeneration will be the
surviving entity of the Post Completion Merger. Failure to complete the Post Completion Merger shall not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Post Completion Merger is subject to
certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the
_Financing—We may be unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame,_
_or at all.”_

In the event the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure that (i) the Guarantors guarantee the Notes and (ii) the Notes
are secured by security interests granted on a first-priority basis over the Post Merger Collateral, in each
case, within 90 days of the Cut-Off Date and subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees,” “Description
_of Notes—Security,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and_
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitation on enforcement_
_and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability.”_

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

_The below information is based on preliminary results and estimates and is not intended to be a_
_comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results. Such information has not been audited,_
_reviewed or verified by our independent auditors. The preliminary results mentioned below are based on_
_our unaudited management accounts. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on such_
_preliminary information, and no opinion or any other form of assurance is provided with respect thereto._
_Our preliminary results are based on our preliminary review of our results of operations and are_
_inherently subject to modification during the preparation of our financial statements, and are not intended_


16


-----

_to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the periods they relate to. As a_
_result, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. See_
_“Forward-Looking Statements.”_

Based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information
currently available, we estimate that our revenue for July 2021 recorded an increase in the single digits
compared to July 2020, while our volumes of waste serviced recorded a marginal decrease compared to
July 2020, which benefited from exceptionally high volumes as activity levels significantly recovered in
the second half of 2020 after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Acquisition of Castiglia_**

On July 2, 2021, we acquired 70% of the equity interests in Castiglia, a company providing integrated
services for environmental protection and sustainability in the Southern regions of Italy, with a particular
focus on the management of waste deriving from water purification processes. Its portfolio of services
includes transport and integrated waste management solutions and plant management services. Through the
acquisition of Castiglia, we expect to enhance our market position in the Southern regions of Italy. The
purchase price for Castiglia was €19.4 million, consisting of €13.6 million paid on July 2, 2021 and
€5.8 million of deferred consideration to be paid within 18 months of such date. In this Offering
Memorandum, we present certain pro forma financial information, adjusted to give pro forma effect,
among other adjustments, to the acquisition of Castiglia as if such acquisition had occurred on July 1, 2020.
See “—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Pro forma Financial Data—
_Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Potential liabilities,_
_costs and reputational impacts from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition, results of operations and prospects,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—_
_Our business is exposed to operational risks, and our employees and others on our and our customers’_
_operations are exposed to health and safety risks” and “Business—Legal and Other Proceedings.”_

**_Settlement Agremeents Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities_**

On August 9, 2021, in connection with the Transactions, we entered into a settlement agreement with
Lauro Quarantasei S.p.A. (the “Lauro Settlement Agreement”) in respect of the 2017 Vendor Loan
Agreement, which the Target, as borrower, entered into on August 3, 2017, with Lauro Quarantasei S.p.A.,
as lender, in connection with the acquisition of Itelyum Purification by the Target Group. Pursuant to the
Lauro Settlement Agreement, we undertook to pay the amount of €16.0 million, adjusted for certain
potential leakages, in full settlement of the outstanding amounts under the 2017 Vendor Loan Agreement,
which were equal to €24.2 million as of June 30, 2021. We expect to make such payment on or about the
Completion Date with a portion of the proceeds of the Notes, as part of the Refinancing. The Lauro
Settlement Agreement is expected to result in approximately €8.0 million of reduction in net total financial
debt, against which we undertook to bear the costs of certain environmental remediation activities relating
to the Landriano purification site, estimated to be approximately €8.0 million as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum. Such amount is expected to be budgeted as provision for environmental liabilities on our
balance sheet. We expect to incur these costs over the period 2021-2030. Concurrently with the settlement
of the obligations under the Lauro Settlement Agreement, an amount of €2.8 million will be released from
escrow and become available to Itelyum Purification in settlement of certain commercial receivables owed
to us by Lauro Quarantasei S.p.A. For further information on such environmental remediation activities

On August 6, 2021, in connection with the Transactions, we also entered into a settlement agreement with
Stirling Square Capital Partners Special Opportunities (n. 1) Limited Partnership (the “SSCP Settlement
**Agreement” and, together with the Lauro Settlement Agreement, the “Settlement Agreements”) in**
respect of the 2016 Vendor Loan Agreement, which Itelyum Regeneration, as borrower, entered into on
February 24, 2016, with SSCP Oil Holdings S.C.A., as lender, in connection with the acquisition of
Itelyum Regeneration by the Target Group. Pursuant to the SSCP Settlement Agreement, we undertook to
repay all outstanding amounts under the 2016 Vendor Loan Agreement, which were equal to approximately
€6.1 million (net of certain indemnification obligations) as of June 30, 2021. We expect to make such
payment on or about the Completion Date with a portion of the proceeds of the Notes, as part of the
Refinancing.

(1) Following the consummation of the Acquisition, SSCP Fund IV, a fund whose ultimate general partner is Stirling Square Capital
Partners Fourth Fund GP Limited, will be, together with certain SSCP-controlled co-investors, the indirect controlling
shareholder of the Target Group. DBAG and the Management Investors will indirectly own approximately 29% and 7%,
respectively, of the share capital of the Target Group. For a description of our principal shareholders and the shareholder
agreement we expect to enter into in connection with the Transactions, see “Principal Shareholders.”
(2) The Issuer is a holding company and is incorporated as a joint stock company (società per azioni) under the laws of Italy. The
Issuer will not control the Target prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. The Issuer is currently not expected to engage
in any activities other than those related to the Transactions, the management of the Target Group following the Acquisition
and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts,
subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any competent authority, to merge with the Target and Itelyum
Regeneration, in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of
Italian law, with MergerCo being the surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Completion Date. The
Post Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Structure and the Financing—We may be unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or_
_at all” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—The Issuer is a holding company that has no_
_revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the_
_operating companies of the Target Group to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_
(3) The Notes will be general, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future
debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s
existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. If the
Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date and the proceeds of the Notes are
deposited into the Escrow Account, as of the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by a firstranking security interest in the Escrow Account. On or about the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking
basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by the Completion Date Collateral. Within 30 Business Days following the
Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured on a first-ranking basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain
significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Post Completion Date Collateral. Following the Post Completion
Merger, within the terms set forth in this Offering Memorandum, the Notes will also be secured by the Post Merger Collateral. In
the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the date falling fifteen months after the Completion Date
(the “Cut-Off Date”), the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that the Notes will be secured, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Target Group Collateral within
90 days of the Cut-Off Date. The Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the Revolving Credit Facility and certain


18


-----

hedging obligations (if any). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to such hedging obligations
(if any) have been repaid in full. The security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances and, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles and to the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be
pledged to secure future indebtedness. The Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws.
See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be_
_released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee or the Security Agent,” “Description of Certain_
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—Security.”_
(4) On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which provides for the
€50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The initial borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility will be the Issuer. Subject to
certain limitations, other subsidiaries of the Issuer, including, following the Acquisition, the Target and its subsidiaries, may
become borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the same entities that guarantee the Notes and will be secured on a firstpriority basis over the same Collateral securing the Notes and certain hedging obligations (if any), subject to the applicable
contractual and legal limitations. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds
from the enforcement of the Collateral after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to such hedging
obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement.”_
(5) On or about the Completion Date, the proceeds under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes will be used by
the Issuer to make the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan for an estimated aggregate principal amount of €82.3 million and
the proceeds under Tranche C (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes will be used by the Issuer to make the Itelyum
Purification Proceeds Loan for an estimated aggregate principal amount of €68.1 million, as further described under “—The
_Transactions—The Financing.” The proceeds from the Itelyum Proceeds Loans, together with cash on balance sheet of the_
Target Group, will be used for the completion of the Refinancing as described under “—The Transactions—The Refinancing”
_and “Use of Proceeds.” The amount of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans is estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum_
and may change depending on several factors, including the timing of the Completion Date.
(6) On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain significant
limitations under Italian law, the Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that,
no later than 90 days from the earlier of (i) the Post-Completion Merger and (ii) in the event the Post Completion Merger does
not occur, the date falling fifteen months after the Completion Date (the “Cut-Off Date”), certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (or
MergerCo, as applicable) guarantee the Notes. Pursuant to the Indenture and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Agreed Security Principles, each subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility or certain other
indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor (as defined below), that is a subsidiary of the Issuer, shall enter into a
supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor. For purposes of this
Offering Memorandum, the term “Guarantors” shall refer to any subsidiary of the Issuer that may guarantee the Notes from
time to time pursuant to the Indenture on or after the Completion Date and the term “Guarantees” shall refer to the guarantees
of the Notes by the Guarantors. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the
subsidiaries of the Target that are expected to guarantee the Notes are Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification accounted for 64.3% of the Target Group’s
revenue, 64.9% of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and, as of June 30, 2021, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum
Purification owned 75.6% of the Target Group’s total assets (net of intercompany balances). Prior to the granting of the
Guarantees by the Guarantors, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations
of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Target and its subsidiaries). The Guarantees will be subject to certain
material contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Guarantee. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.” The Guarantees will be_
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and may be subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”_
(7) Although Holdco is outside the “Restricted Group,” it will be subject to certain limited covenants under the Indenture as a thirdparty security provider. For further information, see “Description of Notes.”
(8) Not all of the subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. As of June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, the Issuer’s (or MergerCo’s, as applicable) subsidiaries which are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have
had €9.7 million in outstanding financial debt (excluding liabilities under recourse factoring of €11.6 million and excluding debt
owed by Castiglia), of which €2.8 million was secured over assets other than the Collateral, which would have ranked structurally
senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those subsidiaries and
minority stockholders of such subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries


19


-----

over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee
therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors), preferred stockholders (if any) and minority
stockholders of such non-guarantor subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of all of the Issuer’s_
_subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.”_

indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee;

                  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by property or

by any members of the Target Group, including
receivables in respect of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans

may be in existence from time to time, is referred to in this
Offering Memorandum as the “Collateral.”

The Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (if

of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to,
but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. Amounts
may be released from the Escrow Account prior to the
Completion Date to pay negative interest charged on the
Escrow Account (if any) and to pay interest on the Notes on any
interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the
release of the proceeds from escrow. See “Description of
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

If the proceeds of the Notes are deposited into the Escrow
Account, pursuant to a shortfall agreement between the Issuer
and Holdco, Holdco will be required to fund the accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, payable to
holders of the Notes in the event of a special mandatory
redemption. We cannot assure you that Holdco will have the
financial resources to meet that obligation. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Transactions—If the conditions to the_


26


-----

_escrow are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop_
_Date, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which_
_means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the_
_Notes. In addition, the Issuer might not have sufficient funds to_
_pay all of the amounts due to the holders of the Notes in the_
_event of a Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

If the gross proceeds of the Offering are not deposited into the
Escrow Account on the Issue Date and the Completion Date
does not occur within one business day of the Issue Date, then,
unless the Completion Date occurs on the following business
day, the Issuer will promptly either (i) redeem the Notes
pursuant to the special mandatory redemption described above
in the case that (x) in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the
Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date or (y) an event of default described under clause
(5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Description
_of Notes—Events of Default” with respect to the Issuer occurs_
or (ii) deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the
Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** At any time on or after October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem
all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices as described
under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus the
applicable Step-up Premium (as defined herein), if any, plus
accrued and unpaid additional amounts if any, to but not
including the applicable redemption date.

At any time prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all
or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the applicable redemption date, and
additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium
(including the applicable Step-up Premium, if any), as
described under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

At any time prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem up
to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including any additional Notes), using the net cash proceeds
from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to
104.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable redemption
date, and additional amounts, if any; provided that at least 50%
of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including any additional Notes) remains outstanding after each
redemption and the redemption occurs within 180 days after the
closing of any such equity offering, as described under
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

In addition, at anytime prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may
redeem during each twelve-month period commencing on the
Issue Date up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes issued (including any additional Notes) at its option, from
time to time, at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but not including, the applicable redemption
date, and additional amounts, if any, as described under
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Step-Up Premium . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event the Issuer redeems the Notes pursuant to (i) the
second or fifth paragraph of “Description of Notes—Optional
_Redemption” at any time on or after June 30, 2022, and/or (ii)_
“Description of Notes—Redemption at Maturity,” and, in each
case, unless the Group has met both of the Sustainability
Performance Targets on the relevant testing date, as certified by
the Issuer to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an
officer’s certificate, which shall also include an Assurance
Letter, on or prior to the relevant Certification Date, the
applicable Step-up Premium will be payable in connection with
the applicable redemption. See _“Description_ _of_ _Notes—_
_Sustainability_ _Performance_ _Targets_ _Step-up_ _Redemption_
_Premium.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of
control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to
repurchase all of the outstanding Notes at a purchase price of
101% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase. See “Description of Notes—
_Change of Control”_

**Optional Redemption for Taxation**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law (or in its interpretation) of any
relevant taxing jurisdiction impose certain withholding taxes or
other deductions on the payments on the Notes, the Issuer may
redeem such Notes in whole, but not in part, at a redemption
price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption. See “Description _of_ _Notes—Redemption_ _for_
_Taxation Reasons.”_

**Withholding Taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Except as provided in “Description of Notes,” all payments
made by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantors under or
with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, will be made
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
present or future taxes unless such withholding or deduction is
required by law. If withholding or deduction for any such
taxes imposed by a relevant taxing jurisdiction is required to
be made with respect to a payment under or with respect to the
Notes or the Guarantees, subject to certain exceptions, the
Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, will pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received
after the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount
that would have been received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction. See “Description _of_ _Notes—_
_Withholding Taxes.”_

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Republic of
Italy and therefore payments of principal and interest on the
Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will
be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as
set forth in “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the
Issuer will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to
holders of the Notes if any withholding or deduction is required
pursuant to Decree No. 239 or pursuant to Italian Legislative
Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”),
except, in the case of Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, where
the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree
No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been


28


-----

complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the
Issuer or their agents. See “Description of Notes—Withholding
_Taxes.” Although we believe that, under current law, Italian_
withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or
Decree No. 461 where a holder of the Notes is resident for tax
purposes in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange
of information with Italy (as identified currently in Ministerial
Decree of September 4, 1996 as subsequently amended and
supplemented and, in the future, in any decree to be issued
under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239; any such decree, the
“White List”) and such holder of the Notes complies with
certain certification requirements, there is no assurance that this
will be the case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the
risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or in Decree No. 461 after
the date of this Offering Memorandum, including any change in
the White List. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
_Italian Tax Considerations.”_

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture will, among other things, restrict the ability of
the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries and, in certain cases,
Holdco, to:

                     - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                       - create or incur certain liens;

                 - make certain payments, including dividends or other
distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer or its
restricted subsidiaries;

                     - repay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

                     - make certain investments;

                   - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of
dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on
the transfer of assets to the Issuer or any of their restricted
subsidiaries;

                    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of
restricted subsidiaries;

                       - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                      - consolidate or merge with other entities;

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of holders of the
Notes; and

                     - amend certain documents relating to the Notes.

The Indenture will also restrict the ability of the Issuer to carry
out certain activities prior to the Post Completion Merger.

Each of these covenants are subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as described under “Description of
_Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as
we achieve investment-grade ratings. See “Description of
_Notes—Certain_ _Covenants—Suspension_ _of_ _Covenants_ _on_
_Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” There can be no_


29


-----

assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade
rating or that any such rating will be maintained. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—Certain covenants will be suspended upon the_
_occurrence of a change in our ratings.”_

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of
any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold, except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. We
have not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the
Notes (including by way of an exchange offer) under the
securities laws in any jurisdiction. See “Transfer Restrictions”
and “Plan of Distribution.”

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The proceeds from the Offering will be used, directly or
indirectly, together with the proceeds from the Equity
Contribution and cash on balance sheet of the Target Group, to
fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, to repay the
Existing Itelyum Debt in full and to pay costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions, as further
described under “Use of Proceeds.”

**No Established Market . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they
are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue marketmaking at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be
maintained.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application has been made to admit the Notes to listing on the
official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trading on
the Euro MTF Market thereof.

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed
by the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor
Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will
be governed by English law. The security documents will be
governed by the applicable law of the jurisdiction under which
the security interests are granted.

**Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c.

**Paying Agent and Transfer Agent . . . .** The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch

**Registrar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch

**Security Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** UniCredit S.p.A.

Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. Prospective investors should refer to “Risk Factors” for a
discussion of certain factors that they should carefully consider prior to deciding to invest in the Notes.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

_The following tables present the summary historical consolidated financial information and operating data_
_of the Target Group. The summary historical consolidated financial information in the tables below is_
_derived from the relevant Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audited Financial Statements are_
_presented in accordance with Italian GAAP and the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements are presented_
_in accordance with in accordance with OIC 30, “Interim Financial Reporting,” the Italian accounting_
_standard that governs the preparation of interim financial statements. The information presented below is_
_not necessarily indicative of the results of future operations._

_The historical unaudited consolidated financial information of the Target Group for the twelve months_
_ended June 30, 2021 presented in this Offering Memorandum is calculated by adding each relevant income_
_statement line item for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the corresponding income statement line item_
_for the full year ended December 31, 2020 and subtracting from such sum the corresponding income_
_statement line item for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This data has been prepared solely for the_
_purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of the Target Group’s_
_financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed by the Target Group’s independent auditors._

_We have also presented summary unaudited as adjusted consolidated financial and other data prepared to_
_give pro forma effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on June 30, 2021 for the as_
_adjusted balance sheet information and on July 1, 2020 for the as adjusted income statement information._
_Such summary unaudited as adjusted financial information is based on available information and certain_
_assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ from actual amounts. It is for_
_informational purposes only and does not purport to present what our results or other metric would_
_actually have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates presented or to project our results of_
_operations or financial position for any future period or our financial condition at any future date._

_The summary consolidated financial information presented below includes certain non-GAAP financial_
_and other measures that we use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are_
_not identified as accounting measures under Italian GAAP and therefore should not be considered a_
_substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with Italian_
_GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles, or those calculated using financial measures_
_that are prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles._

EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, Italian GAAP or
other generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that EBITDA provides useful information with respect to our overall
operating performance. However, this measure is not a measurement of our financial performance under Italian GAAP or other
generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating result,
operating cash flows or any other measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP or other
generally accepted accounting principles or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a
measure of liquidity. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

(2) EBITDA margin represents EBITDA for the relevant period divided by revenue for the same period.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA for the relevant period, adjusted for the CONOU regeneration treatment fee
normalization, extraordinary provision relating to environmental liabilities, IAS 17 leases normalization, one-off costs and
expenses relating to acquisitions and mergers, other one-off items and perimeter adjustments, as further described below.
Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact) represents Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period, further
adjusted for normalized COVID-19 impact. Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact) is identical to Adjusted
EBITDA for the periods under review other than for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2020,
as further described below.

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, Italian
GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (including
normalized COVID-19 impact) provide useful information with respect to our overall operating performance and debt service
capacity by facilitating comparisons of operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items not
directly resulting from core operations. Adjusted EBITDA is the main measure management uses to assess the trading
performance of our business and, therefore, we believe it may be helpful to securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties to assist in their assessment of the trading performance of our business. However, this measure is not a measurement of
our financial performance under Italian GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered a
substitute measure to operating result, operating cash flows or any other measures of performance or our liquidity. Neither our
independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with
respect to the Adjusted EBITDA measures contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance

(a) Represents (i) the normalization of the CONOU regeneration treatment fee for the periods indicated as if the CONOU
regeneration treatment fee for each quarter of the periods presented were calculated on the basis of the ICIS average price of lube
oil recorded during such quarter (as opposed to the average price recorded in the preceding quarter, which is how the CONOU
regeneration treatment fee is calculated), thereby allowing better comparability between the impact of the CONOU regeneration
treatment fee on our EBITDA for a period and the volume of regenerated oil produced within the same period, and (ii) the
compensatory amount granted by CONOU to cover the decrease in earnings resulting from the reduced plant utilization rates
compared to the standard utilization rate determined according to the CONOU Operating Regulation, as modified by CONOU in
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oil regeneration industry, equal to €2.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 (nil for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021).
(b) Represents the additional costs of €0.5 million (in excess of the provisions recorded in our balance sheet for the relevant period)
and provisions for the estimated liability of €2.1 million in respect of environmental remediation activities of Pieve Fissiraga and
Ceccano oil regeneration plants that are expected to be carried out at the Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano oil regeneration plants over
the period 2021-2030, in each case relating to environmental matters that preceded the acquisition of the related assets by SSCP.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We may face liabilities in connection with environmental matters.”
(c) Represents the impact of the exclusion of finance lease costs had the IAS 17 accounting principle been applied for all our leases
relating to industrial equipment for the periods presented. Under Italian GAAP, lease payments are accounted for as
non-recurring costs. Therefore, we have made this adjustment to normalize our industrial-related costs, net of the impact of
non-recurring lease costs that will be nil upon lease redemption.
(d) For each relevant period, the adjustment relates to costs primarily associated with mergers of subsidiaries as a result of internal
reorganizations and the acquisitions we made in such period, including in respect of legal and advisory services and the
rebranding initiatives. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations—Key factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on_
_acquisitions.”_
(e) Represents various one-off or exceptional costs, such as (i) the pro forma impact of the changes to the formula for the calculation
of the CONOU regeneration treatment fee which entered into force in October 2020, as if such changes had occurred on
January 1, 2018, for an amount of €2.2 million, €2.1 million, €1.9 million and €1.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively; (ii) one-off costs incurred in respect of the
sanitization of facilities and purchase of protective equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic for an amount of €0.8 million and
€0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively; (iii) one-off
severance and other exceptional costs primarily relating our personnel and board of directors for an amount of €2.4 million,
€2.0 million, €2.3 million, €0.1 million, €1.2 million and €1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, for
the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively; (iv) extraordinary

trade receivables write-downs and provisions for an amount of €0.7 million, €0.8 million, €0.7 million and €1.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively; (v) the pro forma
impact of the CO2 quota allowance relating to emission trading certificates as if the current allowance were granted starting from
January 1, 2018 for an amount of €1.1 million, €1.1 million, €0.7 million, €1.1 million and €0.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively; and (vi) other minor extraordinary
and one-off costs relating to plant and equipment maintenance, monitoring fees and consultancy costs.
(f) Represent the estimated pro forma impact on our EBITDA of the acquisitions of the Acquired Companies (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, do not include Castiglia), as if each of the Acquired Companies had been acquired on January 1, 2018. For
further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key factors
_Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on acquisitions” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to our Financial Information—The perimeter adjusted financial data included in this Offering_
_Memorandum, including Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, is for information purposes only, is only intended_
_to simulate what our results of operations would have been had the relevant acquired businesses been included in our scope of_
_consolidation for the entire period assumed and has been prepared on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions which we_
_consider reasonable, but it is not a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum.”_
(g) Represents the management’s estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the EBITDA for the relevant period as a result of
decrease in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 (partially offset by reduced costs incurred over the same period due to
reduced activity level), of which €4.4 million relating to our Regeneration business unit and €1.6 million relating to our
Environment business unit, due to lower production, decreased volume of waste serviced and sales volumes resulting from lower
levels of customers’ activity and waste collection, compared in each case with the activity levels in 2019.
(4) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period divided by pro forma revenue. Pro forma
revenue represents our revenue for the relevant period, adjusted to give pro formaf effect to the acquisitions of the Acquired
Companies as if each of the Acquired Companies had been acquired on January 1, 2018, instead of their actual respective
acquisition dates, and has been derived from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data set forth under “—Unaudited Pro forma
_Financial Data” below. We are reflecting these perimeter adjustments in our pro forma revenue for the calculation of Adjusted_
EBITDA margin in light of the fact that our Adjusted EBITDA also takes into account these perimeter adjustments. Pro forma
revenue is a not recognized financial measure under Italian GAAP and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data
contained in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial
_Measures.”_
(5) Net working capital represents the sum of trade receivables, inventories, trade payables, accrued income and prepaid expenses,
accrued expense and deferred income and other assets and liabilities. The following table sets forth the components of our net
working capital as of the dates indicated:

**As of December 31,**

(a) Other assets and other liabilities include the line items “Other current assets” and “Other current liabilities” in our
Consolidated Financial Statements for the period presented.

(6) Adjusted recurring capital expenditure represents additions in property, plant and equipment and additions in other intangible
assets, minus extraordinary capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure, and taking into account perimeter adjustments.
Adjusted recurring capital expenditure is not a recognized measure of financial performance or liquidity Italian GAAP or any
other generally accepted accounting principles and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in this
Offering Memorandum. The following table sets forth a calculation of adjusted recurring capital expenditure for the periods

(7) Adjusted operating cash flow represents Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact) for the relevant period less
adjusted recurring capital expenditure. Adjusted operating cash flow is not a recognized financial measure under Italian GAAP or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in
this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The

(1) _Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, further adjusted to give_
_pro forma effect to the acquisition of Castiglia as if it occurred on July 1, 2020._

_Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance_
with, Italian GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles. The pro forma adjustment relating to the impact of the
acquisition of Castiglia used to calculate Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on the information available to us in connection
with the acquisition of Castiglia, together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. Such adjustment is inherently
uncertain and subject to a wide variety of significant uncertainties. Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur to,
among other things, integrate Castiglia into the Target Group or any potential synergies or other impacts related to or expected to

derive from the acquisition of Castiglia, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of
Castiglia would have been for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, if we had acquired Castiglia on July 1, 2020. We believe
that Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful indication of what our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2021, would have been under the circumstances and assumptions described herein. However, this measure is not a
measurement of our financial performance under Italian GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles and should not
be considered a substitute measure to operating result, operating cash flows or any other measures of performance or our
liquidity. Neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any
procedures with respect to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on
such information or its achievability. “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Information—The perimeter adjusted financial data included in this Offering

certain non-recurring costs and extraordinary expenses, primarily relating to extraordinary personal layoffs due to the
termination of certain service contracts for an amount of €1.2 million, exceptional consultancy costs for an amount of
€0.5 million and extraordinary legal expenses for amount of €0.2 million. The EBITDA of Castiglia for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021 is based on the annual financial statements of Castiglia for the year ended December 31, 2020 and
management accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021.

(2) Represents Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro forma revenue. Pro forma revenue for the last twelve months ended
June 30, 2021 represents our revenue for such period, adjusted to give pro forma effect to the acquisitions of the Acquired
Companies as if each of the Acquired Companies had been acquired on January 1, 2018, instead of their actual respective
acquisition dates, which has been derived from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data (representing an amount of €411.1
million), plus an amount of €30.5 million corresponding to the expected revenue, based on our management’s internal estimate,
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, of Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021. See “Summary—Recent
_Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.” We are reflecting these perimeter adjustments in our pro forma revenue for the_
calculation of Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin in light of the fact that our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA also takes into
account these perimeter adjustments. Pro forma revenue is a not recognized financial measure under Italian GAAP and therefore
no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and
_Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”_
(3) _Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt represents our net total financial debt (before the deduction of financing fees) as_
adjusted for the Transactions and the net financial indebtedness of Castiglia estimated to be in the amount of €1.0 million as of
June 30, 2021. We are also including leases in the calculation of Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt, which inclusion is
not consistent with Italian GAAP, because Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are similarly adjusted to
add-back all lease related expense. Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt does not include (i) liabilities under recourse
factoring for an amount of €11.6 million as of June 30, 2021, (ii) approximately €8.0 million we expect to budget as provision for
environmental liabilities on our balance sheet as a result of the Lauro Settlement Agreement and (iii) €12.1 million of deferred
purchase consideration for acquisitions previously completed, of which €5.8 million relates to the acquisition of Castiglia,
acquired on July 2, 2021, and is expected to be paid in January 2023, all of which we expect to remain outstanding following the
Transactions. For the purposes of this calculation, we have taken into account an estimated amount of pro forma cash, cash
equivalents and other current financial assets of €30.7 million, which reflects our cash, cash equivalents and other current
financial assets as of June 30, 2021 (€66.2 million), adjusted for €27.8 million of cash of the Target Group which we expect to
use to complete the Transactions (as described under “Use of Proceeds”), the partial payment of the purchase price of €13.6
million in respect of the acquisition of equity interests in Castiglia paid on July 2, 2021 and the estimated amount of cash and
cash equivalents of €5.9 million held by Castiglia as of June 30, 2021, as further described in footnote (1) under “Capitalization.”
See also “—Recent Developments—Settlement Agreements Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities” and “—Recent
_Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.” Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt has not been prepared in accordance with_
Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been presented for illustrative purposes only and
does not purport to represent what our net total financial debt would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on the date
assumed, nor does it purport to project our net total financial debt for any future period or our financial condition at any future
date. Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt is not a recognized financial measure under Italian GAAP and therefore no undue
reliance should be placed on such data contained in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” See “Capitalization.” Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt presented herein_
is not calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. See “Description of Notes.”

(4) _Pro forma adjusted net interest expense represents estimated finance cost less finance income for the twelve months ended_
June 30, 2021 after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on July 1, 2020 and assuming
that the Revolving Credit Facility would have been undrawn for the entire period. This estimate reflects, inter alia, the issuance
of €450.0 million 4.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 issued at par. Pro forma adjusted net interest expense is calculated
gross of the debt issuance costs in connection with the Transactions. Pro forma adjusted net interest expense includes lease
expense and expense on debt we acquired as a result of the acquisition of Castiglia, and does not include commitment fees on
undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pro forma adjusted net interest expense has been presented for illustrative
purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions or the
acquisition of Castiglia occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or
our financial condition at any future date. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” Pro forma adjusted net interest expense
presented herein is not calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. See “Description of Notes.”

**Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data**

The following financial data (the “Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data”) sets forth the Itelyum Group’s
results of operations on a constant perimeter basis to reflect the results of operations of the periods
presented as though the Acquired Companies had been acquired as of January 1, 2018. The Acquired
Companies are companies we acquired controlling stakes in, or the entire share capital of, in the period
between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021 and, therefore, do not include Castiglia, which we acquired on
July 2, 2021. We believe the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data when read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes, is a helpful tool to assist readers to view
the business as a whole, and provides meaningful and relevant financial information that is useful in
evaluating the Itelyum Group’s ongoing operations, in the same manner as management views and operates
the business. The Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data is prepared on a different basis than the
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Target included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and
such information is not intended to be compliant with Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted
accounting principles. No reconciliation has been provided from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data
and the Target’s audited or unaudited financial statements. The Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data has
been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management of the Target Group. The independent auditors
of the Target have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the
Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data for the purpose of their inclusion herein. The Unaudited Pro forma
Financial Data is based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties
and you are strongly cautioned against placing undue reliance thereon. We did not own or control the
Acquired Companies prior to the dates on which control passed in accordance with the relevant acquisition
agreements. The preparation of the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data requires management to exercise
judgment and make assumptions with respect to issues such as the reconciliation of accounting policies
(such as in respect of revenue recognition). For these reasons, the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data is
only a simulation of the Itelyum Group’s results had the Acquired Companies been owned for the whole
period assumed and is not an indication of what our results would have been if the Acquired Companies
had been part of the Target Group for such period. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial
_Information—The perimeter adjusted financial data included in this Offering Memorandum, including_
_Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, is for information purposes only, is only intended to_
_simulate what our results of operations would have been had the relevant acquired businesses been_
_included in our scope of consolidation for the entire period assumed and has been prepared on the basis of_
_certain estimates and assumptions which we consider reasonable, but it is not a substitute for the_
_Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.”_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes is subject to a number of risks. Prospective investors should consider carefully the_
_risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum prior to making any_
_investment decision with respect to the Notes. Each of the risks discussed below could have a material adverse_
_effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, which, in turn, could have a_
_material adverse effect on the principal amount and interest, which investors will receive in respect of the Notes._
_In addition, each of the risks discussed below could adversely affect the trading or the trading price of the Notes_
_or the rights of investors under the Notes and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investment._
_Prospective investors should note that the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. We have_
_described only those risks that we currently consider to be material and there may be additional risks and_
_uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, that might also have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-_
_Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Our business and results of operations are impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions and economic_**
**_downturns, particularly in Italy._**

Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, especially in Italy where we generated 78.9% of our revenue for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021, can weaken the primary driver of our customers’ businesses and, in turn,
weaken all segments of our business (Environment, Regeneration and Purification). In a recessionary
environment, a reduction in activity levels from our customers, including as a result of plant closures, may result
in decreasing waste volumes we process and decreasing demand for the products obtained through our waste
treatment processes, such as base oil, gas oil and other by-products. In Italy, after a period of steady growth
resulting in a CAGR of approximately 12% over the years 2014-2019, the volume of hazardous waste recycling
activities is estimated to record a decrease in CAGR of approximately 2% over the period 2019-2021, primarily
as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, our production volume of base oil, gas oil and
bitumen in our Regeneration business decreased by approximately 17%, 17% and 32%, respectively, compared
to 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in collected volumes and reduced demand.

Volatility and decrease in demand for oil-based products can also have a correspondingly negative impact on the
price at which we sell our products and, as a result, our operating income and cash flows. In addition, commodity
prices for raw materials, such as oil or aliphatics, fluctuate according to global economic supply and demand,
especially levels of worldwide economic growth. For example, the selling prices of aliphatics, which are
produced through our Purification activities, are based on the market price of virgin naphtha, which decreased by
22.7% over the period 2018-2020. It can be difficult to predict such macroeconomic trends, which can have a
significant impact on the demand for both our waste services and on the sales of our products. While the waste
management sector is one of the industrial segments that has historically been less affected by global financial
crises and economic slowdown, the recessionary conditions and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment,
especially in Italy, may adversely impact our customers and thus our waste management activities.

In addition, governmental measures (including lockdowns and confinements) implemented to mitigate the spread
of COVID-19 in 2020 also had a negative impact on the sale of products. Furthermore, our business model
involves high fixed costs related to our network of waste management sites, the associated equipment and
personnel. In the event of a sustained economic downturn in Italy, particularly in the Northern regions where the
majority of our plants are located, we may experience difficulty in adjusting our operations in response to the
shifting volumes of waste being treated. Such an event may cause some of our waste management sites to
become idle or operate at lower than peak capacity, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. In addition, as
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our sites have in the past and may in the future have to suspend
operations or operate at reduced capacity due to nationwide governmental measures (including lockdowns and
confinements) that may be implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. See “—The impact of COVID-19
_and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.”_

Political conditions in Italy could also negatively impact our business. In September 2019, a coalition
government composed of the center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement was

41


-----

sworn in. Such coalition government was formed on the back of the 2018 general election, in which no party won
an outright majority, resulting in a hung parliament and leading to protracted negotiations to form a new
government. These negotiations were concluded with the formation of a coalition government, composed of the
League and Five Star Movement parties, which then collapsed in August 2019. Following the recent Italian
government crisis, a new technocratic government was formed in February 2021. It is unclear how long the
current government will remain in office and whether it will be able to adequately address impediments to the
country’s growth, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP,
the write-down of non-performing loans and the reduction of unemployment in Italy. Continuation or further
worsening of these economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position_**
**_and/or liquidity._**

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced and, since then, has spread around the globe, including
in Italy. The resulting disease, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide
quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures, we transitioned a
portion of our workforce to remote working and experienced operational difficulties. Our plants in Pieve
Fissiraga e di Ceccano were closed for several weeks between April and June 2020 resulting in a decrease of our
volume of waste oil processed of approximately 68% compared to the corresponding period of 2019.
Furthermore, the collection, transportation and storage activities of our Environment business unit experienced a
slowdown between March and June 2020.

Additionally, even though the nationwide quarantine in Italy was lifted on May 4, 2020, significant restrictions
and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall Italian economy
and, in turn, our operations and our customers’ operations. In particular, as the number of infections in Italy
significantly increased in the fall of 2020, new drastic measures were taken, including a nationwide evening
curfew and certain more stringent ad hoc measures for regions with higher infection rates, which has resulted in,
among other things, protests and further economic and social turmoil. Between the end of 2020 and early 2021,
restrictive measures continued to be implemented, in many instances with the imposition of localized lockdowns
across Italy along with the nationwide evening curfew. Additional quarantine measures implemented in March
2021 have further restricted interregional travel across the country, causing further disruption to business
activities. Our Regeneration business was particularly impacted by the decline in collected oil and production
slowdown in the first half of 2020 as a result of the lockdown measures implemented by the Italian government,
resulting in a decrease in our production volumes of base oil, gas oil and bitumen. Revenue and EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2020 from our Regeneration business unit decreased by 12.8% and 33.2%,
respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

As a result of the financial and social difficulties generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we could also lose
customers as a result of bankruptcy or other financial difficulties, or customers could otherwise become insolvent
and be unable to continue to pay for our products and services, which could harm our liquidity. Furthermore, the
activities of our agents and sales representatives are and may continue to be limited by the restrictions imposed
by the Italian government or other authorities to address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, which may result
in the loss of existing or potential customers and the slowdown of our future growth rates compared to the past.

In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as
well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the
future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of
European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions, the Italian
government and governments of other member states of the European Union to contain the COVID-19 pandemic
are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear

when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future
outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues
to negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects depends on several
factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness and availability of
vaccines and further restrictive actions taken by the Italian government in response to new strains of the virus,
any additional periods of lockdown in Italy, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and

42


-----

operating conditions will stabilize and recover in Italy. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and
other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations
under the Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening any or all of the other risks described in this “Risk
_Factors” section._

**_We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented market, and competition from established companies as_**
**_well as local specialized competitors could have a negative impact on our business and financial condition._**

The Italian waste management market is highly competitive and fragmented, comprised of a variety of small,
medium-sized and large players. We compete with a large number of small local companies specialized in
selected aspects of the waste management process, including Marazzato, Vidori and Venanzieffe. These local
family-owned companies comprise the majority of the Italian market. In addition, we face competition from
waste management branches of established national multiutility companies, such as A2A Ambiente, Iren and
HERAmbiente. Furthermore, we compete against structured private groups, such as Ecoeridania, Riccoboni,
Ambienthesis and Mecomer. If we are unable to defend our market position by offering competitive services or
reducing our cost bases, the price pressure exerted by these competitors could cause us to lose important
customers.

In addition, existing market participants and new entrants may seek to gain increased market presence through
aggressive underpricing strategies. Where competitors seek to gain or retain market share through strong
discounting or similar competitive business practices, we may be required to lower our prices and rates to avoid
the loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting our operating results. In addition, if we are unable to
anticipate and respond as effectively as our competitors to changing business conditions, including new
technologies and business models, we could lose market share to our competitors.

Furthermore, we may suffer from the rise of alternative techniques in collection and treatment of waste materials
in our industry. Although technologically viable alternatives are currently not readily available, they may be
developed in the future. If these alternatives become more cost effective or more easily accessible, they may
diminish our market share and reduce our revenues. See “—If we are unable to keep pace with technological,
_regulatory and market developments, we may not be able to compete as effectively as our competitors and our_
_business could be adversely affected.”_

In addition, a number of our competitors may consolidate or form alliances with each other in the future, either
internationally or with local waste management companies. The successful consolidation of two or more of our
competitors could result in the combination of their resources and technological capabilities, improved access to
a wider customer base, increased investment capacity and improved economies of scale. This could lead to
intensified competition in our markets and a loss of market share for us. If we are unable to compete effectively
against such consolidated companies or alliances, our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects could be adversely affected.

**_We operate in a number of emerging markets, which exposes us to additional economic and political risks._**

While all of our operating sites are located in Italy, we benefit from a global commercial reach, serving over 60
countries through a network of local distributors. We currently have, or in the foreseeable future anticipate
commencing and expanding, operations in a number of emerging markets, including several countries in Middle
East and Africa, which may expose us to certain risks to a greater extent than in connection with our operations
in more-developed markets. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue generated from emerging
markets accounted for approximately 9% of our revenue for the period. As a result, we are subject to the risks of
doing business internationally, including impositions of tariffs or embargoes, export controls, trade barriers and
trade disputes, regulations related to customs and export/import matters, fluctuations in foreign economies and
currency exchange rates, longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, the complexity
and necessity of using foreign representatives, consultants and distributors, tax uncertainties and unanticipated
tax costs due to foreign taxing regimes, the difficulty of managing and operating an enterprise spanning several
countries, the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights and differing legal systems generally,
compliance with a variety of laws and regulations, and economic and geopolitical developments and conditions,
including international hostilities, armed conflicts, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade
relationships, and military and political alliances.

43


-----

Any of these factors could adversely affect the success and profitability of our operations in those countries.
Moreover, developments in certain emerging markets often affect other emerging markets and, accordingly,
adverse changes in emerging markets elsewhere in the world could have a negative impact on the markets in
which we operate or intend to operate in the foreseeable future. Any failure by us to effectively manage these or
other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

**_Our operations are subject to an increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations, especially in_**
**_regards to the environment._**

Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent and detailed European and national laws and regulations that
impose various conditions and limitations on the treatment, acceptance, identification, storage, handling and
transportation of, inter alia, industrial by-products, hazardous liquid and solid waste materials, wastewater
discharges, greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”), air and odor emissions and soil contamination. Moreover,
stringent and evolving regulations apply to the machinery and equipment that we use to operate our business.
Environmental regulations have changed rapidly in recent years, and it is possible that we will be subject to even
more stringent environmental standards in the future.

The regulatory framework governing our operations imposes significant compliance burdens on us and requires
us to obtain permits and operational and environmental authorizations. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in
obtaining, a permit or authorization, the non-renewal of or a challenge to a permit or authorization, or the
imposition of more stringent conditions associated with the permits and authorizations we are required to obtain,
could result in substantial fines, claims relating to violations of environmental laws or regulations or the
revocation or suspension of certain authorizations, concessions and/or licenses and, in turn, have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We may also incur significant costs and other expenditures with respect to our waste management sites to
comply with our obligations under various environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations, as
well as in sanitary risk management, in particular with respect to water discharges, waste processing, soil and
ground water contamination and GHG emissions.

We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the
protection of human health and the environment, including laws and regulations concerning employee health and
safety. We can give no assurance, however, that we will continue to be in material compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations, including as a consequence of new thresholds and standards introduced by amendments to
the applicable legislation. Any future violation of such laws and regulations could require us to pay fines and
damages, result in the closure of one of our waste management sites, damage our reputation or impede our ability
to continue to conduct our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our failure to successfully maintain EHS policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_reputation and otherwise on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

We are involved in significant and complex projects that require constant monitoring and management of EHS
risks across our businesses. We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety.

While we have adopted EHS policies and procedures in order to minimize such risks, a failure in such policies
and procedures may occur. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability including
monetary fines or compensation to third parties or other sanctions. Any failure to comply with our internal EHS
policies and/or to comply with health and safety practices or environmental risk management procedures in
general that results in serious or fatal harm to employees, subcontractors, the public or the environment could
also expose us to investigations and administrative sanctions, prosecutions criminal or civil litigation, each of
which could determine an increase in costs for fines, settlements and management time. See “—Potential
_liabilities, costs and reputational impacts from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our_
_business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” and “Business—Legal and Other_
_Proceedings” for information regarding certain EHS-related proceedings._

Our safety record is critical to our reputation and ability to obtain new business. A growing number of our
customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts, and many contracts
provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some, or all, of its contract fees or profit in the event we fail to

44


-----

meet certain such measures. As a result, our failure to maintain adequate EHS standards could result in reduced
profitability or the loss of projects or customers, breach of laws or regulations and may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may fail to obtain, renew, or comply with the terms of the licenses, authorizations and permits required for_**
**_our operations, and the development or operation of our waste management facilities may be slowed or_**
**_interrupted due to administrative law and rules and conditions imposed by local governments._**

We currently operate 12 waste storage sites and, 13 waste treatment and recycling facilities, including four plants
for industrial wastewater treatment, two plants for lube oil regeneration and two plants for purification and
blending of solvents and five treatment and pre-treatment plants. Many of our operations require permits and
controls to monitor or prevent pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by
issuing authorities and are frequently issued subject to conditions requiring the implementation of improvement
works at the relevant sites. Typically, our permits require continuous compliance with certain conditions in order
to maintain the permit. Our permits may require us to adhere to evolving compliance requirements and
environmental standards, which could result in significant additional costs or environmental obligations for us.

In addition, we expect the waste volume processed in our facilities to increase over the next few years, including
through the continued development of centers of excellence in waste management in order to capture market
growth, investments in special projects aiming at expanding our production capacity and expanding the type of
services we provide at certain of our waste management sites. Our waste management sites require a variety of
permits related to environmental, building permit, fire prevention, seismic and zoning laws that typically cover a
period from eight to 16 years, which we may not be able to renew for existing sites or obtain for new sites or
existing sites currently offering fewer services. The permit application process in Italy from the submission of the
application to the receipt of the final authorization to operate the relevant site can be lengthy, as decisions may be
subject to review, legal or other challenge or delay. Obtaining the required permits and approvals to expand
capacity at existing sites or build new facilities has become increasingly burdensome and expensive, requiring
numerous hearings and compliance with various building permit, fire prevention, seismic, zoning, environmental
and regulatory laws in general and drawing resistance from citizens and environmental or other groups. We
cannot guarantee that we will receive such authorizations within an expected time frame or at all and be able to
open additional sites or expand capacity at existing facilities in the future. Despite material compliance of our
facilities with regulatory requirements, we occasionally face opposition relating to the operation of such facilities
by local communities who do not want a waste management facility in their vicinity on public nuisance or other
grounds. Local communities or other stakeholders may challenge our permits or authorizations before the
competent administrative court, which could significantly slow or interrupt operations or development of new
waste management facilities. Increased opposition from local communities may also make it increasingly
difficult for us to find locations for new facilities or expand existing facilities, which may have a material adverse
effect on our ability to expand our operations. Delays and/or an inability to obtain the relevant permit for any of
our waste management sites could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Our business is exposed to operational risks, and our employees and others on our and our customers’_**
**_operations are exposed to health and safety risks._**

The operation of our business involves many operational risks, including transportation accidents, mass
instability or waste slides, the risk of breakdown or failure of expensive and sophisticated equipment and
processes, the risk of substandard performance by our personnel and catastrophic events such as fires, explosions,
severe weather, floods, terrorism, crime, power loss, unexpected geological or other physical conditions or other
catastrophes which could materially impact our facilities and disrupt our operations. Our Regeneration business
is primarily carried out through two facilities located in Northern and Central Italy, while our Purification
business is principally carried out at a solvent purification facility and a solvent blending and filling facility, each
located in Northern Italy. The occurrence of disruptive events at our facilities could significantly disrupt or
severely curtail our operations, especially in relation to our Regeneration and Purification activities which are
conducted through a limited number of facilities. These events could also result in reduction in efficiency for our
operations, lost revenue during the period of disruption and/or costly remediation, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that any
such events put our employees in danger, we may also be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, and suffer
reputational damages.

45


-----

In addition, because of the nature of the industrial activities conducted at our waste management sites, there
exists a risk of injury or death to our employees and others in the course of our and our customers’ operations,
notwithstanding the safety precautions we take, such as in relation to exposure to chemical substances or
artificial optical radiation. Violations of, or liabilities under, applicable EHS laws and regulations could result in
fines, penalties, legal claims as well as increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition. In the event of an industrial accident, we
may be faced with an interruption in service and claims for damages, which could be costly and time-consuming
to defend, in addition to being exposed to potential reputational damage, which could result in the loss of
customers. Should we be found to be negligent, or the cover provided through insurance prove to be insufficient
or the specific risk found to be not covered by insurance, the corresponding shortfall in or lack of insurance could
mean that we are liable for the injury suffered. Under applicable Italian law, in cases where workers become
injured in connection with their employment duties and as a result are absent from work for more than 40 days,
the relevant public prosecutor must open an investigation into workplace safety and, depending on the
circumstances, may bring criminal proceedings against our regional officer charged with workplace safety or
against our management or chief executive officer. Any conviction for failures or omissions related to workplace
safety may violate a morality clause in relevant public tenders, expose us to liabilities under Legislative Decree
No. 231/2001 and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects. See “—Potential liabilities, costs and reputational impacts from litigation and other proceedings
_could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”_

We are also subject to risks related to an outbreak of a disease, such as COVID-19, in one of our storage sites, or
at one of our suppliers’ facilities, or at those of our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on
our operations by requiring us to reduce the number of employees on site to comply with social distancing
requirements, invest in protective and other safety equipment and accelerate the deployment of automated
machinery. The outbreak of a disease in one of our sites may limit our ability to operate our business. If any or all
of the risks described above arise, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, prospects and cash flow available to service our indebtedness.

**_Maintaining compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to both our products and raw_**
**_materials could adversely affect our business._**

We must comply with a broad range of regulations relating to the testing, manufacturing, labelling and safety
analysis of our chemical products or the chemical products of our suppliers. In the European Union, these types
of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue.

In particular, in the European Union, certain of the waste produced through our Regeneration business and
certain of the Purification products and raw materials produced in, exported from or imported into and/or sold in,
the European Union are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the
registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. The European Union Regulation concerning
the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006)
(“REACH”) (as amended and updated from time to time), imposes significant obligations on the chemicals
industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of building block and
semi-specialty chemicals. REACH is reviewed annually and, as a result, new regulations that further impact our
businesses and operations may be proposed and implemented in the future. In addition, the regulation on
classification, labelling and packaging (Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008) (“CLP”), imposes further obligations in
relation to the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals that are treated by our Purification business
unit.

In connection with the REACH regulation, certain of the waste treated as part of our Regeneration business could
be classified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, on users of our products or
on our employees. As part of our compliance with the REACH regulation, we are required demonstrate that the
risks to human health or the environment associated with uses of these substances are adequately controlled by
carrying out periodic testing of their toxicological level. These regulations could significantly impact our cost of
operating our Regeneration and Purification business units, and we may incur significant costs and other
expenditures to maintain continuous compliance with such laws and regulations. As a result, our failure to
maintain compliance with the abovementioned chemical safety standards and regulations could result in a breach
of law and could in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_We may face liabilities in connection with environmental matters._**

We may be liable for any environmental damage that our current or former waste management sites cause,
including damage to neighboring landowners or residents, particularly as a result of the contamination of soil,
groundwater or surface water, and especially drinking water, or to natural resources. We may also be liable for
the damages caused to human health by the presence of hazardous materials (including asbestos and other
potentially carcinogenic substances) at the premises owned or operated by us, as well as for any on-site
environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances whose transportation or treatment we
or companies we acquired arranged or conducted and we may also be liable for any environmental damage (such
as contamination) caused by former owner(s) of the sites that we currently own and/or operate. Those costs or
actions could be significant to us and impact our results of operations, cash flows and available capital. From
January 2018 to December 2020, we carried out a number of remediation projects, primarily in relation to our oil
regeneration plants and solvent purification plants, for which we incurred approximately €4.0 million of costs,
primarily for environmental analysis and remediation activities. As of June 30, 2021, we had made provisions of
€6.4 million for potential environmental liabilities and ecological clean-ups. In addition, pursuant to the Lauro
Settlement Agreement, which we entered into on August 9, 2021, we undertook to bear the costs of certain
environmental remediation activities relating to the Landriano purification site, estimated to be approximately
€8.0 million as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Such amount is expected to be budgeted as provision
for environmental liabilities on our balance sheet. We expect to incur these costs over the period 2021-2030. See
“Summary—Recent Developments—Settlement Agreements Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities.”

We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for our environmental liabilities, such coverage may not cover all
of the potential liabilities to which we may be subject and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the
future at reasonable expense or at all. It is also possible that government officials responsible for enforcing
environmental laws may believe an issue is more serious than we expect, or that we will fail to identify or fully
appreciate an existing liability before we become legally responsible for addressing it (including the case where
such officials identify us as responsible for certain contaminations and environmental breaches in general in
relation to which investigations and analysis are currently ongoing). Some of the legal sanctions to which we
could become subject could cause the suspension or revocation of a required permit, prevent us from, or delay us
in, obtaining or renewing permits to operate or expand our waste management sites, or harm our reputation.
There can be no assurance that the cost of such cleanup or that our share of the cost will not exceed our estimates.
Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_Changes in waste disposal patterns and commodity prices could adversely affect our results of operations by_**
**_reducing the volume of waste available to us for processing._**

As a result of governmental regulations and growing environmental awareness, certain of our waste producing
customers have undertaken or could undertake actions to reduce their waste. For example, some of our customers
could begin to set up environmental policies to reuse certain of their products and reduce waste generally. Waste
reduction programs may reduce the volume of waste available for processing in some areas where we operate.
Though governmental authorities increasingly favor recycling over alternative waste disposal methods, we can
provide no assurance that waste volumes will be available in sufficient quantities to keep our waste processing
and recycling sites operating at sufficient capacity. Any significant change in regulation or patterns regarding
disposal of waste could have a material adverse effect on our revenue by reducing the level of demand for our
services.

In addition, our business is also exposed to fluctuations in costs related to certain commodities, such as oil and
electricity, which we extensively use for carrying out our operations and operating our equipment and vehicle
fleet, or to changes in the applicable legal and regulatory framework. Prices for oil and electricity are
unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical
developments, supply and demand, change in applicable laws and regulations, adverse weather and regional
production patterns. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in passing on cost increases to
customers without losses in revenue or gross profit margin. Accordingly, a significant change in commodity
prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_The success and profitability of our business is partly dependent on our ability to retain and renew existing_**
**_contracts and to win new contracts._**

Our success and profitability depend on our ability to retain and renew existing contracts, to maintain volumes
under existing contracts and to acquire and successfully negotiate new or expanded contracts. We typically
collect waste pursuant to contractual arrangements or orders, the majority of which are yearly contracts. Though
we have historically had a high renewal rate for such contracts and have a long standing relationship with the
majority of our customer base, the customers under such contracts may turn to our competitors, cease their
operations, terminate their contracts with us, increase pricing pressure on us or cease to require our services due
to changes in their business model. Our customer contracts for waste services generally contain provisions for
termination and events of default that allow our respective customers to terminate their agreements with us for a
number of reasons, some of which are outside of our control.

Furthermore, certain of our contracts are awarded following a competitive bidding process. Such processes may
be lengthy and we may be required to devote significant resources, both in terms of management time and
finances, on bidding for contracts that we ultimately may not win. If, after the competitive tender process, we do
not succeed in being awarded the contracts for new business or fail to renew existing contracts, our market share
and revenue could materially decline, which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Some of our competitors may also be better capitalized
than we are or be able to provide or be willing to bid their services at a lower price than we may be willing to
offer.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of, and value associated with, our brand could adversely affect our_**
**_business._**

Our brand represents an important business asset. We believe that the brand awareness, preference and loyalty
that our end-customers show for the Itelyum brand are an important competitive advantage. We rely on
marketing to strengthen our brand and our marketing initiatives may prove to be ineffective. Any future negative
perceptions of our brand, in respect of, for example, product quality, price level of our products and services,
effectiveness and timeliness of our services or our commitment to EHS issues, could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Maintaining the reputation of and the value associated with our brand is central to the success of our business and
there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this objective. Substantial erosion in the reputation
of or value associated with our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Our strategy of pursuing acquisitions of businesses may present unforeseen integration obstacles or cost._**

Our business strategy includes the acquisition of businesses, and our future growth and performance will partly
depend on our ability to successfully select and integrate such acquisitions. In the ordinary course of business, we
actively seek to identify and pursue bolt-on acquisition opportunities that allow us to maximize territorial
coverage and consolidate our leading positioning in our core verticals of Environment, Regeneration and
Purification, or expand to new verticals. Between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021, we acquired controlling
stakes in or the entire share capital of ten companies (excluding the transactions where we only increased our
stake in previously acquired companies and companies that were already controlled by the acquired companies).
We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisitions opportunities going forward or complete any
particular acquisition, combination, joint venture or other transaction on acceptable terms. Acquisitions pose
additional risks, including potential overpayment in relation to purchase price, incurrence of unexpected costs or
the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed risks. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic
acquisitions may depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or otherwise raise
substantial capital, and we may not have or be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition
strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Furthermore, such transactions could be significant or
transformational in size and importance for the Itelyum Group and the consolidation of the results of such
businesses may affect the comparability of our financial statements with prior periods. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability_
_of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on acquisitions.”_

48


-----

In evaluating potential acquisitions, we make certain assumptions regarding the future combined results of the
existing and acquired operations, the consolidation of operations and the improved operating cost structures for
the combined operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably operate the acquired
businesses and that the expected synergies or benefits will be achieved on the assumed time schedule or in the
assumed amount, if at all. We cannot predict the timing and success of our efforts to acquire or combine with any
particular business and fully integrate the acquired business into our existing organizational set-up, commercial
channels and operating model.

Moreover, we may in the future enter new geographies and seek to leverage our core expertise and know-how by
penetrating new European markets, such as the industrial waste management, the oil regeneration or the
pharmaceutical purification markets. Should we pursue this strategy, we cannot provide any assurance that we
will be able to profitably operate in such new geographies or markets and to achieve the level of revenue,
profitability and growth that we expect. If we acquire businesses outside of Italy, we would be exposed to, among
other risks, increased regulatory risk, which could result in an increase of compliance related costs and increased
risks of breaching laws and regulations which we may not be familiar with and the associated consequences.

In addition, the integration of an acquired business and its systems, operations and personnel, particularly in
respect of businesses operating in new and adjacent markets, could be more difficult and time-consuming than
anticipated, including as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted
in response of such pandemic. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable also because of the
complexity of waste treatment processes involved, and/or when the size of the acquired business is significant as
compared to the size of the acquiror. Successful integration also requires coordination of different teams (e.g.,
engineers or R&D personnel). This integration can prove difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural
conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions or commercial approach and, more generally,
organizational and operations set-up. Any of these factors could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key
employees, suppliers, agents and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated synergies, any of which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are exposed to counterparty risks, and delayed payments or non-payments by our customers could_**
**_adversely affect us._**

Our ability to receive payment for the products and services we sell depends on the continued creditworthiness of
our customers. Collection of receivables for customers of our Regeneration and Purification business units
typically takes place within 60 days, while our Environment customers generally pay within 100 days of
invoicing. Certain of our waste management customers and purchasers of our by-products may become insolvent
or default under their contracts, or be or may become significantly late in performing under their payment
obligations to us. As of June 30, 2021, we had €91.8 million in trade receivables and provisions for impairment
of such receivables were 1% of our total balance, including €2.3 million relating to the delay in payment of a
customer of our Purification business unit, which receivable arose prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic in early 2020. In 2020, we suffered from some other delays in payment from customers due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. In case of a default in payment obligations, we may be unable to collect the related
receivables, in which case some or all of such outstanding amounts would need to be written off and we would
need to seek alternative sources of funding for our working capital requirements. In case of a delay in a
customer’s payment obligation, we may be exposed to the risk of bearing in advance the costs and amounts
necessary to provide our services to such customer. Should the Italian economy experience further economic
volatility or tightening credit markets, the risk that we may not be able to collect payments on a timely basis from
our customers could materially increase. Further, a deterioration of economic conditions in Italy, including as a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by
our customers. Accordingly, this could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as in a
reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flow. See “—The
_impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or_
_liquidity.”_

Finally, if we underestimate the amounts needed for our allowance for bad debts or if our customers delay or fail
to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, we may not be able to meet our working capital or
debt service requirements and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be
materially adversely affected.

**_If we are unable to keep pace with technological, regulatory and market developments, we may not be able to_**
**_compete as effectively as our competitors and our business could be adversely affected._**

Our business activities and operations are subject to technological changes, ongoing innovation and evolving
industrial standards. We believe that our innovations, technology, industrial know-how and the industrial design
of our waste management facilities are key differentiating factors in a competitive marketplace, and consequently
we devote a significant amount of our resources to developing and adopting best practices related to the
implementation of industrial processes relevant to the services we provide as well as associated research and
development. Our Regeneration business benefits from a patented proprietary process for the productions of
lubricant bases, the Revivoil technology, which was developed in collaboration with the French company Axens
and is now widely used by leading lubrication companies worldwide. We and other players in the industry are
increasingly focusing on technology solutions that either provide alternatives to traditional waste management
processes and/or improve value extraction from the waste management value chain. However, such research and
investment activities may require substantial investments on our part and dedication and resources by our
management and workforce and may not ultimately yield the tangible benefits to our business. If we are unable
to successfully implement the new technologies that we develop or apply technologies that we purchase and/or
license, we may not be able to recover the costs spent on their development or acquisition. If we fail to innovate
or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology that provides a benefit over
our waste services, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

In addition, if we are unable to predict or adapt to emerging industry and market standards and other
technological and regulatory changes, or fail to adopt other technologies offered by our competitors, our revenue
and results of operations might be adversely affected. We may also experience increased customer churn and the
subsequent migration of our customers to our competitors’ products and services. Such migration may lead to a
loss of market share, which could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Our Regeneration business relies on the incentives mechanisms provided by CONOU and its supply of waste_**
**_oil._**

We rely on incentive mechanisms established by CONOU (Consorzio nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e
_trattamento degli oli minerali usati) to support our Regeneration business. CONOU is a private Italian_
consortium established in 1984 to promote and support waste oil collection and regeneration activities in Italy.
Since 2010, CONOU has set up an incentive mechanism paid to oil regeneration companies, the CONOU
regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lube oil (i.e. the fee increases
upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), thus ensuring that Itelyum and other players in the
Italian regeneration industry are granted certain downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lube oil
prices. Lube oil producers fund the oil regeneration value chain by paying to CONOU a fee, as required by the
current legal and regulatory framework, which during the last 10 years resulted in approximately €0.09 on
average for each litre of lubricant oil sold in Italy. CONOU distributes the amounts so collected via, inter alia,
the regeneration treatment fee. The regeneration treatment fee granted by CONOU thus sustains the circularity in
all the phases of the waste oil economic cycle and permits us to significantly offset the cyclical decrease in oil
prices by supporting a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products. See “Business—
_CONOU Incentive Mechanisms.” For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue from CONOU_
represented 34% of revenue from our Regeneration business unit for the period. Revenue from our Regeneration
business unit accounted for 29.0% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. In addition, our
Environmental business unit generated approximately 4% of revenue from services provided to CONOU for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

CONOU has recently amended the formula for determining the regeneration treatment fee, which came into force
in October 2020. We expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after December 2024,
except in exceptional circumstances indicated in the CONOU Operating Regulation which, in any event, cannot
be retroactive. Any significant amendment to the formula and the current framework for incentive mechanics
established by CONOU may have a material impact on the profitability of our Regeneration business, and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In
addition, the Italian government may decide to adopt a different model for the collection and treatment of waste
oil, including adopting a free market approach, which is already in place within several countries in the European
Union, including Germany, France and Sweden, where regeneration industry players do not benefit from such
favorable framework. The adoption of a different model may materially and adversely affect our profitability and

50


-----

would require us to make significant adjustments to our Regeneration operations and the methods we employ for
waste collection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

In addition, the majority of the waste oil processed in our Regeneration activities is supplied by the collection
companies affiliated with CONOU pursuant to contractual agreements that we enter into with each collection
company directly on a company-specific basis, with an average length of three years. For the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021, approximately 18% of total volume of waste oil was supplied to us by collection companies
affiliated with CONOU. Any deterioration of our relationship with CONOU, as well as any disruption or delay in
the supply of waste oil by the collection companies could materially impact the volume of waste oil supplied to
us, and we may be unable to source input products from other suppliers at the required volume, and/or at the
same or lower prices, which could result in delays in our Regeneration business unit processes and an associated
inability to provide our customers with the volumes required under our contractual arrangements with them or
within the agreed timing. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The development of the electric vehicle market and renewable fuel technologies could impact our_**
**_Regeneration business._**

There is a global trend, particularly in developed markets, such as Italy, towards increased use of electric vehicles
(including hybrids) and policies supporting vehicle electrification. Many companies are investigating ways to
develop technologies to produce high quality fuel using renewable feedstocks. At the same time, vehicles
powered by hybrid systems and electric motors are beginning to gain a significant market share. Even though
lube oil consumption in Italy is envisaged to remain stable over the period 2021-2030, demand for gasoline and
diesel fuel in road transport may experience a decrease due to consumers’ environmental concerns and the automanufacturers’ continuing rollout of new, highly efficient car models. A more rapid dissemination of new
renewable fuel production technologies or new vehicles powered by advanced fuel efficiency or hybrid or
electric engines may result in lower levels of oil fuel consumption and thus have an adverse effect on our
Regeneration business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Our future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract highly skilled employees. The loss_**
**_of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations._**

We believe that the members of our senior management team are key to our business. We have put in place
policies and remuneration designed to retain and incentivize management; however, there can be no guarantee
that we will be able to retain and properly incentivize management or to find suitable replacements should any of
them terminate their relationship with us. Should senior management leave in significant numbers or if a critical
member of senior management were to leave unexpectedly, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We believe that our future success also depends upon our ability to continue to train, retain, effectively manage
and attract highly skilled technical, managerial and marketing personnel. If our efforts in these areas are not
successful, the quality of our products and level of services offered to our customers, and therefore customer
satisfaction, may decline, which could harm our reputation and, in turn, adversely affect our business and results
of operations. Although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining highly skilled employees, we
face intense competition for personnel in the waste management industry and certain of our competitors are
larger and have greater financial resources for attracting highly skilled employees. A material loss of key
employees or the failure to retain and attract suitably qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on
our continued ability to compete effectively. In addition, if our key management and operating personnel
becomes infected with COVID-19, they could be unable to work for a period of time. Furthermore, the measures
adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could make the integration of newly hired personnel more
challenging. See “—The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations,
_financial position and/or liquidity.”_

**_Third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights._**

Our success increasingly depends on establishing and protecting our intellectual property rights. Our industrial
processes and chemical know-how are built around proprietary technologies underpinned by 14 patents, with four
additional patents in the process of being registered. Our intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents,

national and EU trademarks, domain names and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions. Aspects of
our intellectual property contribute to our identity, and the recognition of our products and services are an
integral part of our business. If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our
competitive position may suffer which could, in turn, materially harm our operating results.

We may need to spend significant resources monitoring or enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may
or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. In addition, our intellectual property may also be
infringed by our employees through error or malfeasance. Employees may use our intellectual property to
establish competing businesses or may disclose sensitive information regarding our patents or proprietary
technologies. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our
intellectual property rights quickly or at all. Moreover, potential actions taken to enforce our intellectual property
rights, both in Italy and abroad, may not be effective and, in some circumstances, enforcement may not be
available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business or legal
reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or
by developing non-infringing competing technologies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our_**
**_financial results or prevent fraud._**

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud.
Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. This risk is increased
as a result of our frequent bolt-on acquisitions. Certain entities that we acquired in the past did not have internal
control procedures in certain respects to the same standard as our procedures. If we fail to maintain adequate
internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, our financial
statements may not accurately reflect our financial condition.

**_If we experience labor disputes or work stoppages, our business could be materially adversely affected._**

The Italian constitution provides that all employees of Italian companies have the right to set up and join trade
unions and to carry on trade union activities, including appointing workers’ representatives to negotiate with their
employer. As of June 30, 2021, less than 25% of our employees belonged to trade unions. The right to go on
strike is provided for under Italian law and there can be no assurance that there will not be any strikes in the
future, such as in connection with our current and future reorganization efforts. Any work stoppages resulting
from employee strikes could hinder our ability to provide our standard level of production and services. In
addition, we are from time, and could in the future be, party to labor disputes with certain of our current
employees or former employees who could, for example, challenge the validity of their dismissal. There can be
no assurance that these disputes or future disputes by employees will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In addition, from time to time, we have and may in the future, carry out collective dismissals. Such collective
dismissals may result in disputes with or claims by trade unions and our employees and we may be required to
pay additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims.

**_We are subject to risks associated with security breaches of or damage to our IT systems._**

We rely on numerous information technology systems regarding customer relationship management and
maintenance systems to coordinate waste management services (both in-house and with third-party partners),
trace waste through our business, manage waste treatment activities, process transactions, summarize and report
results of operations and comply with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. Our performance depends upon
accurate, timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid day-to-day business and
decision-making processes. The administration of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these
systems. In addition, we outsource the operation and maintenance of certain of our information technology
systems to seek to ensure effective management of our information technology resources, as well as to improve
the cost efficiency of our information technology infrastructure, systems and applications. We rely on the ability
of our outsourcing partners to deliver agreed services. Their failure to perform satisfactorily could have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Although we seek to protect confidential technical information and know-how, we still face the risk of undue
disclosure to third parties due to circumstances beyond our control. We may experience from time to time

-----

cyber-threats, cyber-attacks and cyber-security breaches, which can include unauthorized attempts to access,
disable, use, modify or degrade our information, systems and networks, and the data within, or the introduction
of computer viruses and other malicious codes and fraudulent “phishing” e-mails that seek to misappropriate data
and information, or install malware onto users’ computers. Cyber-threats and breaches vary in technique and
sources, and are caused by criminal hackers, purveyors of financial fraud, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions,
industrial espionage and employee malfeasance or error, among others. These threats are persistent and
increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect. A breach of cyber/data security measures that
impairs our IT infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our waste
management sites, access customer information and communicate with third parties. Any loss of confidential or
proprietary data through a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

Upon the completion of an acquisition, we seek to integrate our IT systems with those of the acquired company.
Successful integration of information processes requires a number of factors including but not limited to
experience and qualifications of information security specialists implementing the integration procedure, ability
to ensure network controls and maintain confidentiality during network transmission and ability to design and
implement a single, unified system. There is no assurance that there will not be any failure or delays in planned
IT integration which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_More stringent regulations in the area of data privacy could adversely affect our business, financial condition,_**
**_results of operations and prospects._**

In the ordinary course of business, we process personally identifiable information on customers, business
partners, employees, third parties and others (including name, address, age, bank details and personal sensitive
information) and therefore we must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws and regulations. Any
processing of personally identifiable information of individuals located in the European Economic Area in the
course of the provision of services is governed by the European data protection laws and regulations, which
restrict our ability to collect, process and use personally identifiable information relating to customers, potential
customers, business partners, and employees, including for marketing purposes.

Such laws and regulations concern the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer of personally
identifiable information. In particular, starting from May 25, 2018, our operations are subject to the provisions of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) and to the
Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, as amended by Legislative Decree no. 101/2018, which
adapted Italian rules to GDPR). The GDPR increased both the number and the restrictive nature of the
obligations binding us in particular with respect to the collection, processing and use of personally identifiable
information.

The GDPR, inter alia, provides for significant applicable maximum fines, up to the higher of (i) €20 million or
(ii) 4% of annual global turnover per breach, as opposed to fines of less than €1 million under the former regime;
more onerous consent requirements, as consent will always have to be express/opt-in, while implied/opt-out
consent has at times been deemed sufficient under the former regime; and stronger rights for individuals,
including an individual “right to be forgotten,” which would require us to permanently delete a user’s personally
identifiable information in certain circumstances.

We adapted our internal procedures and operations to the requirements imposed by the GDPR and the Italian
Privacy Code and have taken actions to ensure the constant and complete implementation of the best practices for
compliance with the applicable data protection regulatory framework. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance
that we carried out the GDPR and the Italian Privacy Code implementation effort in an appropriate effective and
timely manner, and any related failure in complying with the applicable data protection and privacy regulatory
framework could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

Finally, the European Commission has proposed to replace Directive 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic
Communications (the “E Privacy Directive”) with a new regulation primarily aimed at aligning certain
provisions of the E Privacy Directive to the GDPR. The Proposal for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic
Communications (the “E Privacy Regulation”) was published by the European Commission on January 10,
2017 and is currently under negotiation in light of the draft proposals issued by the European Parliament and the
European Council. The draft E Privacy Regulation proposes heightened regulatory requirements in connection

53


-----

with unsolicited communications, the use of cookies, security of personally identifiable information,
confidentiality of communications, consent, data security and data integrity. In line with the GDPR, breaches of
the E Privacy Regulation may result in maximum fines equal to the greater of €20 million and 4% of the annual
global turnover of the sanctioned company.

The regulatory environment governing our use of data relating to identifiable individuals (customers, employees
and others) is complex. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change frequently, and compliance
with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant costs to make necessary systems changes and
implement new administrative processes.

Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations could
result in proceedings, investigations or actions (including class actions) brought against us by governmental
entities/agencies or private individuals/entities, significant fines, penalties, judgments and reputational damages
to our business, requiring us to change business practices and increasing the costs and complexity of compliance,
any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

We have non-euro denominated assets, liabilities, revenue and costs as we carry out operations in currencies
other than the euro, principally in U.S. dollars. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is for the
purchases of certain raw materials and sales of certain of our products in U.S. dollars. Foreign exchange exposure
has typically been relevant to our Purification business unit, which recorded 13.8% of its revenue in U.S. dollars
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, corresponding to 5.0% of our revenue for the period. Foreign
currency transactions are accounted for at the euro-equivalent amount based on the exchange rate set on the
transaction date, while the exchange differences realized at the date of collection or payment are recorded in the
income statement as foreign exchange gains or losses. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the
euro against U.S. dollars or other currencies will affect the amounts attributed to these items in our consolidated
financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. See also “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Results of_
_Operations—Fluctuations in currency exchange rates.” Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange_
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential reintroduction of individual currencies_**
**_within the Eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could negatively impact our business or_**
**_our ability to refinance our liabilities._**

Economic and political events in recent years affecting European economies have raised a number of questions
regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union. Credit risk in these countries and in
other Eurozone countries could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the
overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and
political circumstances in individual euro member states. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and
tensions in North Africa and Eastern Europe and other world events could adversely affect the economies of the
European Union and those of other countries. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and
economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Commission and EU member states
to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe, the overall stability of the Eurozone, the influx of refugees
in certain European countries and the rise of populism in Europe. In addition, political repercussions of responses
to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union
could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European
Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. See “—The impact of COVID-19
_and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.”_

On March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom officially triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of
Lisbon, signaling the start of a two-year period in which the United Kingdom would negotiate the terms of its
exit (“Brexit”) from the European Union. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020, before which the
United Kingdom and the European Commission reached an agreement on the future trading relationship between
the parties (the “UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement” or “TCA”). On December 30, 2020, the UK
Parliament approved the European Union (Future Relationship) Bill, thereby ratifying the TCA. The TCA was
applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 to April 30, 2021 as it was subject to formal approval by the

54


-----

European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before it came into effect. On April 27, 2021 and
April 29, 2021, respectively, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union formally approved
the TCA, which entered into force permanently on May 1, 2021. While it is difficult to predict the effect of
Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the
United Kingdom and the European Union could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and
a material adverse effect on the buying behavior of commercial and individual customers. The resulting political
and economic uncertainty could also lead to further calls for other governments of other member states of the
European Union to consider withdrawal from the European Union or the abandonment of the euro as a currency.
Such developments, or the perception that any such developments could occur, could have a material adverse
effect on global economic conditions, the stability of the global economy and our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the
euro as a currency, or the reintroduction of an individual currency in Italy, could have major negative effects on
our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely affect the economy in Italy, where we
provide products and services to our customers. In particular, the departure of Italy from the euro would increase
our exposure to changes in currency rates. In addition, the departure of Italy from the Eurozone may lead to the
imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate control laws. Any of these developments could affect our ability to
refinance our liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. The potentially severe impact of these events on Europe and the global financial
system could also have a negative impact on the value and marketability of the Notes.

**_We are from time to time involved in various tax and social security audits and investigations and we may face_**
**_tax and social security liabilities in the future._**

We are from time to time subject to tax and social security audits and investigations by tax, social security and
other public authorities, which may include, without limitation, investigations with respect to the direct tax and
indirect tax regime of any of our transactions and value-added tax classification and social security contributions.
Adverse developments in laws or regulations, or any change in position by the relevant authorities regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects or on our ability to service or otherwise
make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, the relevant authorities may disagree with
the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax and social security treatment or characterization of
any of our transactions, including the treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, including the Notes,
existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction of interest expense, which could lead to
disputes with such authorities, as a result of which we may be required to pay monetary fines or other
administrative or other sanctions. We may also fail, whether inadvertently or for reasons beyond our control, to
comply with tax and social security laws and regulations relating to the treatment of any of our transactions or
financing arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax and social security treatment for such transactions
or arrangements, and possibly lead to significant fines or penalties. Whenever a reasonable settlement with the
relevant tax and social securities authorities cannot be reached, we may have to defend ourselves before the
competent courts, which could be costly and distract management from the other affairs of our business. In
addition, audits and investigations by the competent authorities may generate negative publicity, which could
harm our reputation with customers, suppliers and counterparties. We can provide no assurance that the financial
impact of any adverse tax or social security adjustment in connection with our business would not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Potential liabilities, costs and reputational impacts from litigation and other proceedings could adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

From time to time, we or certain of our managers have been and currently are party as defendant or plaintiff in
various legal proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of our business. The results of pending or future legal
proceedings are inherently difficult to predict and we can provide no assurance that we will not incur losses in
connection with current or future civil, administrative or employment suits or other types of judicial, regulatory
or administrative proceedings that exceed any provision we have set aside in our financial statements or that
exceed any insurance coverage available.

For example, two criminal proceedings are currently pending against two of our managers in relation to different
accidents which resulted in serious personal injuries for one of our employees and for one of the employees of a
third party company providing on-site services for us. These accidents were allegedly associated with the

55


-----

violation of applicable Italian workplace health and safety regulations. With regard to these proceedings, no final
and binding (i.e., non-appealable) decision has been issued as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. One of
these criminal proceedings is currently pending against the former technical director (direttore tecnico) and sole
director of Castiglia in his position as former legal representative of Castiglia. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021, represented approximately 7.6% of the Group’s Pro forma
Adjusted EBITDA. This proceeding was initiated by the relevant prosecutors as a result of accidents relating to an
employee of Castiglia, who suffered serious personal injuries in 2017 at the premises of certain clients of Castiglia.
The second criminal proceeding was initiated against one of our managers, who had been appointed to supervise
compliance with health and safety standards for Itelyum Regeneration in relation to an accident occurred at a side
managed by Viscolube S.r.l. (now Itelyum Regeneration). In particular, an employee of a third party company
providing on-site services to Itelyum Regeneration was severely injured during certain oil discharge operations.
Moreover, in June 2021, the abovementioned former sole director of Castiglia was sentenced to one and a half
months of imprisonment after a final and binding (i.e., non-appealable) ruling issued against him in his position as
former legal representative of Castiglia by the Italian Supreme Court (corte di cassazione) for, among other things,
culpable injuries in relation to another accident that occurred in 2014 to another employee of Castiglia, who suffered
serious personal injuries during operations carried out at Castiglia premises.

While as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, neither Castiglia nor Itelyum Regeneration is party to any
criminal proceeding in relation to these accidents, these alleged violations may potentially lead to an assertion of
criminal liability for Castiglia and/or Itelyum Regeneration under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001. If Castiglia and/
or Itelyum Regeneration were to be involved in a proceeding under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, a potential
conviction of either company could result in, among other things, sanctions and penalties, civil and administrative
fines, operational bans (including on a precautionary basis) being imposed on it. Moreover, according to general
principles of Italian administrative law, the alleged health and safety violations and the relevant criminal
proceedings, besides needing to be mandatorily disclosed to relevant public tendering authorities in the context of
the public tender procedures to which Castiglia and Itelyum Regeneration take part pursuant to applicable Italian
regulations, could also, irrespective of any potential liability under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, result in the
disqualification of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, from future or ongoing tender processes for the
awarding of contracts with public entities (both upon a discretional assessment by the competent public contracting
authority or upon a decision by an administrative court following a claim by competitors of Castiglia or Itelyum
Regeneration, as applicable, on a case by case basis, and as a general and automatic effect), in particular in the event
of a final and binding conviction (i.e. non-appealable) of the managers of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as
applicable. In addition, these alleged health and safety violations could potentially trigger the termination of certain
ongoing contracts to which Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, is party with public entities and the
enforcement of any bid or performance bond provided by Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration to the relevant public
contracting entities, where applicable, which could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See “—We may incur liabilities for the actions of our
_directors, employees, agents, representatives and intermediaries,” “—Our business is exposed to operational risks,_
_and our employees and others on our and our customers’ operations are exposed to health and safety risks,” and_
_“Our failure to successfully maintain EHS policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our_
_reputation and otherwise on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” and_
_“Business—Legal and Other Proceedings.”_

Moreover, in the aftermath of public health measures implemented in Italy as well as our temporary personnel
initiatives due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could be subject to an increase in litigation, in
particular in relation to our employees, including with respect to health and safety measures.

In addition, even if a litigation claim (of any nature) against us or any of our current or former managers and
employees is without merit, does not prevail or is not pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions
against our business or products could adversely affect our reputation. Regardless of its final outcome, litigation
may also result in substantial costs and expenses we would have to incur to defend ourselves, divert the attention
of our management or cause an interruption of our normal business operations, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Ownership of our vehicle fleet and equipment stock presents a number of risks._**

We own a vehicle fleet consisting of more than 120 vehicles, including collection trucks and other industrial
vehicles. In general, the cost of maintaining such assets in good operating condition increases with their age.
While our vehicle fleet and equipment are relatively young and in a good state of repair, we will incur increasing
costs as such machinery ages and needs to be replaced due to obsolescence or otherwise. Moreover, government

56


-----

regulations and safety or other equipment standards may also change, requiring us to incur additional
expenditures related to upgrades or replacements of vehicles and equipment.

The price and supply of fuel needed to run our collection trucks and our equipment is unpredictable and
fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil
and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil-producing countries, regional
production patterns and environmental concerns. Any significant increase in fuel prices could increase our
operating expenses and may interrupt our operations. Our failure to offset all or a portion of increased fuel costs
through increased fees or charges would reduce our operating margins and therefore have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our_**
**_insurance costs may increase._**

We hold insurance of various types, including, but not limited to, property damage insurance, general liability
coverage and directors’ liability insurance. We may not always be able to accurately foresee all activities and
situations in order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our insurance policies and, as a result, we
may not be covered by insurance in specific instances. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance,
not all claims are insurable and we may experience incidents of a nature that are not covered or entirely covered
by insurance. We maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the other potential risks and liabilities associated
with our business.

For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the
risk presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for insurance policies can increase
substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance policies may no longer be available, may be available but not
economically viable or may be available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability
may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient or effective under all
circumstances and against all liabilities to which we may be subject. We could, for example, be subject to
substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of several events within one calendar year, which could have a
material adverse effect on our insurance premiums. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in
response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance
market in general. We may not be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs._**

We sell and market our products in Europe, the United States and several countries in Africa and Asia. Doing
business worldwide requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions, including,
without limitation, the European Union and the United States. Our international operations are subject to anticorruption laws and regulations, antitrust laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations,
including those administered by the United Nations, the European Union and the United States. Anti-corruption
laws such as the FCPA and the Bribery Act and other similar laws generally prohibit companies and their
intermediaries from making improper payments to public officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. The expansion of our international reach, including in developing countries and emerging markets,
could increase the risk of such violations in the future. We rely on our management structure, regulatory and
legal resources and effective operation of our compliance program to direct, manage and monitor the activities of
our employees and agents, including of our network of distributors. Despite our oversight and compliance
programs, there is a risk that our internal policies and procedures will not always protect us from deliberate,
reckless or inadvertent acts of our employees or agents that contravene our compliance policies or violate
applicable laws. Violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations, antitrust laws and regulations or economic
sanctions laws and regulations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a
material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See “—We operate in a number of
_emerging markets, which exposes us to additional economic and political risks.”_

**_We may incur liabilities for the actions of our directors, employees, agents, representatives and intermediaries._**

Conducting our business in an ethically acceptable manner is important to our reputation and business prospects.
Any contact by our directors, employees or agents with public administration organizations as well as with
private individuals, under certain circumstances, involves risks associated with, among others, fraud, bribery,
corruption and other fraudulent activities by our employees and related investigations. Furthermore, we are
exposed to the risk that our directors, employees or agents could commit environmental or workplace safety

57


-----

violations or crimes. As a result, we may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business
interruptions, negligence or willful misconduct (including corruption) or other tortious acts by our employees.
Such claims may be substantial and may result in adverse publicity for our Group. Accordingly, these claims
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and
cash flow available to service our indebtedness.

Although we maintain and update internal monitoring systems (including the internal control model pursuant to
Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 aimed at, inter alia, preventing direct or indirect acts of corruption, bribery,
anti-competitive behavior, money laundering, fraud, deception, tax evasion and any other illegal or otherwise
unethical conducts), we may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of such conducts involving our
directors, employees, consultants, agents and third party agents representatives and intermediaries. Any of the
foregoing circumstances (including our failure to adequately implement and update such monitoring systems)
may expose us to civil, administrative and criminal penalties, also pursuant to the provisions of Legislative
Decree No. 231/2001, as well as to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences.

In particular, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, we may be held responsible for certain crimes
committed in our interest or for our benefit by individuals having a functional relationship with us, including
third party agents or intermediaries, unless we were able to prove that such individuals fraudulently violated our
internal control model and it would have been impossible for us to avoid such violation. In such circumstances,
we may be subject to fines, confiscation of profits or legal sanctions (applied in certain cases as interim
measures-i.e. during the investigations), including the termination of financing arrangements suspension of our
operations and confiscation of profits. The duration of these disqualifications range from a minimum of three
months to a maximum of two years, although in very serious cases some of these disqualifications can be applied
permanently. Finally, not all of our subsidiaries have adopted or fully implemented a compliance system
pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/2001; therefore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in
defending against possible proceedings in relation to the administrative liability pursuant to Legislative Decree
No. 231/2001. See “—Potential liabilities, costs and reputational impacts from litigation and other proceedings
_could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”_

Any of the foregoing events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Additional tax expense or additional tax exposure may affect our future profitability._**

We are subject to various taxes, including corporate income tax (“IRES”), regional business tax and related
surcharges (“IRAP”), value added tax (“VAT”), excise duties, tax on financial activities, tax on financial
transactions, stamp duty and substitutive taxes. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax which may
be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions. In addition, these assumptions
include assessments of our future earnings that may impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. Our future
results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate, changes in our overall
profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in
the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax
returns and continuing assessment of our tax exposures. Corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be
analyzed in Italy. Significant changes to the corporate tax system in Italy and any country in which we operate, or
may operate, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_We face risks related to the services we provide to government and other public entities._**

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated approximately 3% of our revenue through the sale of
products and services to central and local public administration customers and agencies and listed statecontrolled companies, including through public tenders. Commercial relationship involving public entities carry
various risks inherent in the government contracting process, including the following:

    - terms and conditions of contracts with public sector entities tend to be more onerous than other
contracts and may include, among others, extensive rights of audit, more punitive service-level
penalties and other restrictive covenants;

    - contractual non-compliance (including improper billing), failure to comply with procurement
regulations and regulation regarding the protection of classified information, and other improper or
illegal activities, may result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, fines

58


-----

and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, in addition to other typical
remedies for breach of contract, which may include termination of the relevant contracts, forfeiture of
profits and suspension of payments. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Potential
_liabilities, costs and reputational impacts from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect_
_our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects;”_

    - government contracts are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other contracts.
Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may
adversely affect our business and reputation;

    - participation in government contracts could subject us to stricter regulatory requirements, which may
increase our cost of compliance;

    - political and economic factors, such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in
leadership among key executive or legislative decision-makers, revisions to governmental tax or other
policies and reduced tax revenue, can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed
or the speed at which new contracts are signed;

    - litigation or disputes with government and public entities may lead to us being banned from contracting
with other government and public entities or participating in public tenders, which would have both an
economic and a reputational impact on us; and

    - public sector-related customers sometimes follow payment management processes that are subject to
review by other government authorities or other entities, which may cause delays or adjustments to
their own payment schedule.

Any or all of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Information**

**_The preparation of our financial statements involves judgments, estimates and assumptions, and changes in_**
**_financial accounting standards may cause unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of_**
**_operations._**

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of our assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by
us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our operating results
may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our
assumptions. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements
include those related to property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, provisions for risks
and charges and bad debt provision, environmental liabilities and inventory obsolescence provision. For further
information on the assumptions pertaining to such financial statements components, see our Consolidated
Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, actual
performance may be higher or lower than our estimates for a variety of reasons, including unanticipated
competition, regulatory actions or changes in one or more of our contractual relationships. We cannot assure you
that any of our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will be correct.

**_The Consolidated Financial Statements are based on Italian GAAP and there may be differences between our_**
**_financial position and results of operations prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP and IFRS or U.S._**
**_GAAP. In addition, should we decide to adopt IFRS as our accounting reporting method, this could potentially_**
**_result in material changes to certain of our financial information from our information presented in this_**
**_Offering Memorandum._**

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum are based on Italian GAAP,
which differs in certain respects from IFRS and U.S. GAAP. We have not presented a reconciliation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS and U.S. GAAP in this Offering Memorandum. Because there are
differences between Italian GAAP and IFRS and U.S. GAAP, there could be certain significant differences in our
results of operations, cash flows and financial position, including levels of indebtedness, under IFRS and U.S.
GAAP. In addition, we may adopt IFRS in the near future, which could potentially result in changes to our
results of operations, cash flows and financial position from the amounts presented in this Offering
Memorandum. These changes could result from, among other things, the different possible approaches toward

59


-----

impairment under IFRS and the requirement to assess our assets and goodwill for impairment as part of the
conversion from Italian GAAP to IFRS. For a discussion of the certain significant differences between IFRS and
Italian GAAP, see Annex A to this Offering Memorandum.

**_The perimeter adjusted financial data included in this Offering Memorandum, including Adjusted EBITDA_**
**_and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, is for information purposes only, is only intended to simulate what our_**
**_results of operations would have been had the relevant acquired businesses been included in our scope of_**
**_consolidation for the entire period assumed and has been prepared on the basis of certain estimates and_**
**_assumptions which we consider reasonable, but it is not a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements_**
**_included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._**

We have prepared certain perimeter adjusted financial data in this Offering Memorandum, including Unaudited
_Pro forma Financial Data, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma revenue and adjusted_
recurring capital expenditure.

Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data, Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma revenue and adjusted recurring capital
expenditure provide more granularity regarding the performance of our business after adjusting for additions to
our scope of consolidation, assuming that the Acquired Companies had been part of our consolidation perimeter
since January 1, 2018. The Acquired Companies are companies we acquired in the period between January 1,
2018 and June 30, 2021 and, therefore, do not include Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021. No
reconciliation has been provided in this Offering Memorandum from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data to
the Target Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and
_Other Data—Other Financial Data” and “—Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data.”_

This Offering Memorandum also contains management estimates in the calculation of our Pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA and pro forma revenue with respect to the additional Adjusted EBITDA and revenue, respectively, we
expect to generate from the acquisition of Castiglia. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other
_Data—Other Pro forma Financial Data” and “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.”_

While we believe that this perimeter adjusted financial data can be useful to potential investors seeking to
evaluate our performance over time, such financial data has been prepared on a different basis than our
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and such information is not
intended to be compliant with Italian GAAP or any other accounting standards. Such perimeter adjusted financial
data has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management. Our independent auditors have not audited,
reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the perimeter adjusted financial data for the
purpose of their inclusion in this Offering Memorandum. The perimeter adjusted financial data has not been
prepared in accordance with the published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines published by any other
regulatory or industry body regarding estimates, the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act,
the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation.

The perimeter adjusted financial data is based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to
inherent uncertainties and you are strongly cautioned against placing undue reliance thereon. The preparation of
the perimeter adjusted financial data requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions with
respect to issues such as the reconciliation of accounting policies (such as in respect of revenue recognition). For
these reasons, the perimeter adjusted financial data is only a simulation of the Itelyum Group’s results had the
relevant acquired businesses been owned for the whole period assumed and is not an indication of what our
results would have been if the relevant acquired businesses had been part of the Target Group for such period.
The perimeter adjusted financial data is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks
and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially had the relevant acquired businesses
been owned for the entire period and there are significant differences between the perimeter adjusted financial
data and the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We did not own or control the Acquired Companies prior to the dates on which control passed in accordance with
the relevant acquisition agreements. In some cases, such Acquired Companies were not operated as standalone
businesses and therefore certain allocation of headquarters and similar costs have been estimated. Additionally,
upon taking control of the Acquired Companies, we implemented our own industrial and distribution strategy
which in some cases may have differed in material ways from the prior owners’ strategy.

In addition, the pro forma adjustment relating to the impact of the acquisition of Castiglia used to calculate Pro
_forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on the information available to us in connection with the acquisition of_
Castiglia, together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. Such adjustment is inherently uncertain

60


-----

and subject to a wide variety of significant uncertainties. Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur to,
among other things, integrate Castiglia into the Target Group or any potential synergies or other impacts related to
or expected to derive from the acquisition of Castiglia, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what the Adjusted
EBITDA contribution of Castiglia would have been for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, if we had acquired
Castiglia on July 1, 2020. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated results will be realized.

Accordingly, investors should not unduly rely on any of the perimeter adjusted financial data presented in this
Offering Memorandum, as such data could significantly differ from our actual future performance. In addition, we
will not provide holders with an analysis of any differences between the estimates contained herein and actual
results later achieved, and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such estimates under any circumstances.
Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact), Pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt, Pro forma adjusted net interest expense and any associated
ratio presented herein are not calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders of the Notes._**
**_Holders of the Notes will not be able to rescind their decision to invest in the Notes if any such amendments_**
**_were made or in the event of changes in the financial condition of the Target Group._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement.
However, the Acquisition Agreement may be amended and the closing conditions may be waived at any time by
the parties thereto, without the consent of holders of the Notes. Furthermore, any amendments made to the
Acquisition Agreement may make the Acquisition less attractive. Any amendment to, or waiver of the closing
conditions under, the Acquisition Agreement may be materially adverse to holders of the Notes, which, in turn,
may have an adverse effect on the return the holders expect to receive on the Notes.

Holders of the Notes will decide to invest in the Notes at the time of purchase thereof and will not be able to
rescind their decision to invest in the Notes, including in the event of changes in the financial condition of the
Target Group or the terms of the Acquisition or the terms of the approvals or clearances (including regulatory
clearances) related to the Acquisition prior to the release of the gross proceeds of the Notes from the Escrow
Account upon completion of the Acquisition.

**_If certain conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be required to_**
**_redeem the Notes, which means holders of the Notes may not obtain the return they expect on the Notes. In_**
**_addition, the Issuer might not have sufficient funds to pay all of the amounts due to the holders of the Notes in_**
**_the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption._**

If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date, as of the Issue
Date and prior to the Completion Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be deposited into the Escrow
Account. Completion of the Acquisition within one business day following the release of the escrowed funds is
one of the conditions to releasing the proceeds of the Offering from escrow. If the proceeds of the Notes are
deposited into the Escrow Account and the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date for any reason and, as a result, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to be held in escrow are not released,
the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to the
initial issue price of the Notes, without the payment of any call premium, and holders of the Notes may not
obtain the investment return they expect on the Notes. The Issuer may also undertake a special mandatory
redemption at any time if, in its good faith judgment, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Escrow
Longstop Date. Moreover, if the Completion Date is anticipated to occur within one business day of the Issue
Date, the gross proceeds of the Notes will not be deposited into the Escrow Account and will be transferred to the
Issuer. In such case, the bank account or accounts of the Issuer where the gross proceeds will be deposited will
not be pledged in favor of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date and the proceeds
of the Notes are deposited into the Escrow Account, the escrow funds will initially be limited to the gross
proceeds of the Offering and will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is equal
to the issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the date of
the special mandatory redemption, and additional amounts, if any. In addition, certain fees and escrow related
costs will be deducted from the amounts deposited on the Escrow Account. If the proceeds of the Notes are
deposited into the Escrow Account, under a shortfall agreement between the Issuer and Holdco, Holdco will

61


-----

agree with the Issuer to contribute to the Escrow Account an amount necessary to pay, subject to reasonable
maximum cap, the special mandatory redemption price on the special mandatory redemption date, to the extent
the amounts in the Escrow Account are insufficient. Holdco, however, is a holding company that as of the Issue
Date will not have material assets other than the shares it holds in the Issuer and may not have adequate financial
resources on the special mandatory redemption date to honor this obligation. In the event such shortfall
agreement is not honored, the Issuer may not have sufficient funds to make these payments.

**_The Target’s historical financial information may not be representative of our future results._**

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the
statement of profit or loss, statements of financial position or statement of cash flows that might occur as a result
of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Target (prior to
the completion of the Post Completion Merger) and MergerCo (following the completion of the Post Completion
Merger), as applicable, will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under Italian
GAAP and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial
statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting
could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our
statement of financial position, which may include, inter alia, intangible assets, such as goodwill. We may also
recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, if we
provide consolidated financial statements for periods after the Completion Date at the level of the Issuer or
MergerCo (instead of the Target), our future financial statements could be materially different once the
adjustments are made and may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
Offering Memorandum.

The Target is currently controlled by the SSCP Sellers. The Issuer does not currently control the Target Group
and will not control the Target Group until completion of the Acquisition. Prior to the Completion Date, the
Target Group will not be subject to the covenants described in “Description of Notes.” Holders of the Notes will
not be able to rescind their decision to invest in the Notes, including in the event of changes in the financial
condition of the Target Group or the terms of the Acquisition. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such
date, the Target Group will not take actions that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had such
covenants been applicable, including paying dividends, incurring debt or liens or making investments.

Holders of the Notes will decide to invest in the Notes at the time of purchase thereof and will not be able to
rescind their decision to invest in the Notes, including in the event of changes in the financial condition of the
Target Group or the terms of the Acquisition.

**_The Acquisition may entitle the Target Group’s customers or other business partners of the Target Group to_**
**_terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target and its
subsidiaries, in which case the counterparties to such agreements will be entitled to terminate their agreements
with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing**

**_Our substantial indebtedness and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and prospects and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under_**
**_the Notes and the Guarantees._**

After completion of the Transactions, we will have incurred significant indebtedness and we will have substantial
debt service obligations. As of June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have
had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €472.1 million, including €450.0 million
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes but excluding additional liabilities under recourse factoring for an
amount of €11.6 million as of June 30, 2021, and an additional €50.0 million available for drawing under the
Revolving Credit Facility. We anticipate that we will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future.
See “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

 - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Revolving Credit
Facility and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

62


-----

 - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

 - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payments in respect
of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, research and development or other general corporate purposes;

 - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

 - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment
and the industry in which we operate;

 - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors; and

 - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business
opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future
borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
obligations, including under the Notes. Although the terms of the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, such limitations will be subject to exceptions and
qualifications and the incurrence of additional indebtedness would exacerbate the risks above.

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by
prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are
beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we
might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure
you that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or satisfactory terms, if at all, or
would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post_**
**_Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the operating companies of the Target Group to be_**
**_able to make payments on the Notes._**

After the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will not have any subsidiaries and will have no
assets (other than the proceeds of the offering of the Notes which will be deposited into the Escrow Account and
will be charged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes if the Completion Date is anticipated
to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date). The Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities upon
the Completion Date are expected to be its equity interests in the Target and its outstanding indebtedness and
inter-company balances incurred in connection with the Transactions, including its receivables under the Itelyum
Proceeds Loans and its indebtedness under the Notes and, if any, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. As a
result, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends, principal repayments
under the Itelyum Proceeds Loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to
meet its outstanding indebtedness service (including under the Notes) and other obligations, and such dividends
and other payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing our indebtedness, including any
financing agreements of our subsidiaries. The amounts of dividends and other payments available to the Issuer
will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to
declare dividends under applicable law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer. Our
subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest
payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. In addition, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or
may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to
make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. Following the Post Completion Merger, to a
certain extent, the above-mentioned risks will apply to MergerCo.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of these
subsidiaries to transfer cash to the Issuer and, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo. Applicable tax
laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of
our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such
payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the Post Completion Merger,
MergerCo’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, will generally be limited to the
amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due. In addition, the
aggregate amount of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans is currently expected to be approximately €150.4 million, which
is significantly lower than the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes, and we expect that the Itelyum Proceeds

63


-----

Loans will accrue interest at a rate that will be generally consistent with the rate applicable to the Notes.
Accordingly, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes will
largely depend on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to it, which
will be subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective.

The subsidiaries of the Issuer or, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo that do not guarantee the
Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees. While the
Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the Post
Completion Merger, MergerCo’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or
make other intercompany payments, these limitations will be subject to significant qualifications and exceptions,
including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may be unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all._**

We intend to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any
competent authority, to implement the Post Completion Merger in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and
following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of Italian law, with MergerCo being the
surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Completion Date. Article 2501-bis of the Italian
Civil Code is the central provision in the Italian legislation regulating merger debt push-downs (thus its
application constitutes a safe-harbor vis-a-vis the risk that any such merger can be considered unlawful, also
from a financial assistance perspective, with ensuing consequences). In order to complete the Post Completion
Merger, there are various steps that we must take, including the preparation of a merger plan, a report by the
directors of the companies involved in the Post Completion Merger (relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and a
report by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing the sustainability of debt at the level of
MergerCo. Furthermore, Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code is also based on the premise that the merger
follows an acquisition of control of the target by another entity. Although there is no specific case law by Italian
courts available on the interpretation of this requirement, according to the majority of legal scholars, a change in
the direct shareholder holding the majority of the shares in a merging company is sufficient for the requirement
to be satisfied (and thus for Article 2501-bis to apply).

Our estimation of the timing required to complete the Post Completion Merger is based upon market practice for
leveraged buyouts in Italy, which typically involve acquisition vehicles in the form of joint stock companies
(società per azioni) where an independent expert is required to be appointed by the competent court, which
creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Post Completion Merger can be expected to
take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the independent expert will release its report or that the
other steps required for the Post Completion Merger will be taken in a timely manner, or at all. Subject to certain
exceptions, the Post Completion Merger can only be implemented following the expiration of 60 days after the
latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolutions approving the Post Completion Merger.
Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the companies involved in the Post Completion Merger are entitled
to challenge the Post Completion Merger.

Following the Post Completion Merger, in the event that the Target or Itelyum Regeneration is the successor
company of the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo will, upon consummation of the Post Completion Merger,
assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture. Although as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum we expect that Itelyum Regeneration will be the surviving entity of the Post Completion Merger, if
the Post Completion Merger is ultimately structured such that Itelyum Regeneration is not the surviving entity, or
if there is a new resulting entity, then Itelyum Regeneration will be required to transfer licenses and permits
relating to the conduct of its business operations to the new entity resulting from the Post Completion Merger.
There is no assurance that in such event Itelyum Regeneration will be able to transfer its licenses or permits in a
timely manner, or at all, or that our business may not be materially adversely affected as a result.

Concurrently with the Post Completion Merger and as a result thereof, the security interest over the Issuer’s
receivables in respect of the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan will be automatically terminated and,
depending on which entity will survive the Post Completion Merger, certain other Pre Merger Collateral will be
extinguished by operation of law and, in particular, (a) in the event that the Issuer is the successor company of
the Post Completion Merger, the Target Share Pledge and the pledge over the share capital of Itelyum
Regeneration, will be extinguished by operation of law; (b) in the event that the Target is the successor company
of the Post Completion Merger, the pledge over the share capital of the Issuer and the pledge over the share
capital of Itelyum Regeneration will be extinguished by operation of law; and (c) in the event that Itelyum
Regeneration is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, the pledge over the share capital of the
Issuer and the Target Share Pledge will be extinguished by operation of law.

64


-----

In addition, subject to and on terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days following
completion of the Post Completion Merger, as applicable, MergerCo and Holdco will grant or reconfirm, as
applicable, the security interests in the Post Merger Collateral. In the event we are unable to consummate the Post
Completion Merger, the Post Merger Collateral will not be granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, and
Verde Bidco S.p.A. will remain as the Issuer. In addition, in the event that the Post Completion Merger does not
occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, in addition to the Pre Merger Collateral, the Issuer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to procure that the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
perfection requirements and certain significant limitations described under “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “—The_
_Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” by security interests_
granted on a first-priority basis over the Target Group Collateral within 90 days of the Cut-Off Date.

In addition, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain significant limitations under Italian law, the
Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, no later than 90
days from the earlier of (i) the Post Completion Merger and (ii) in the event the Post Completion Merger does not
occur, the Cut-Off Date, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer guarantee the Notes. Pursuant to the Indenture and
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each subsidiary of the Issuer that
guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility or certain other indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor
(as defined below) that is a subsidiary of the Issuer, shall enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of
the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor. There can be no assurance, however, that we
will be successful in procuring such Guarantees within the time period specified, and in any event such
Guarantees would be limited as set forth in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We may borrow up to €50.0 million under the Revolving
Credit Facility, which will be secured by the same collateral as the Collateral for the Notes, and the Indenture will
also permit the incurrence of additional debt. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will also
permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur
indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the
Notes, and any such indebtedness could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions
will be subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of indebtedness that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions is substantial. If additional debt is incurred, the related risks that
we now face would increase. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to
service our debt and other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain covenants which impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements will limit our ability to, among other things:

 - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

 - create or incur certain liens;

 - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer or
its restricted subsidiaries;

 - repay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

 - make certain investments;

 - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to
and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or any of their restricted subsidiaries;

 - sell, lease or transfer certain assets including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

 - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

 - consolidate or merge with other entities;

65


-----

 - impair the security interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes; and

 - amend certain documents relating to the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of Notes—
_Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to operate our business, to_
finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in
our interest. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while the Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances,
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a
certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the_
Revolving Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will
meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement could, subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the relevant creditors will be entitled to cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit
Facility and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with
accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default, event of default and/or acceleration action
under the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including (in the case of acceleration of
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility) the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the
Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our
subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if
we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to
secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit
Facility and our obligations under the Notes, or to refinance our debt and to fund our ongoing operations or
expansion plans, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is
subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,
legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are
beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity
needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility.
At the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility (which will mature 4.5 years following the Completion Date and
thus prior to the maturity of the Notes), the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, we may be required to
refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other
capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

 - sell assets;

 - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

 - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions
will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In
such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

66


-----

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us
to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of
could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be
acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our
obligations, which could cause an event of default under our debt and result in:

 - our debtholders declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;

 - the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement being able to terminate their commitments to
lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and

 - our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment in the
Notes.

**_The drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and any future variable interest rate debt we may incur in_**
**_the future will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and_**
**_reducing our cash flow, or could otherwise be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes._**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR for loans
denominated in euro or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for loans denominated in any USD and
any other approved currency by the lenders other than euro, plus an applicable margin. In relation to loans
denominated in euro, the Issuer will have the ability to switch to risk free rates prior to June 30, 2023. These
interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with the Revolving
Credit Facility, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments
on the Notes.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates,
there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging
itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate
any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated
with the Revolving Credit Facility would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

In addition to the above, following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement
agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the
banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR
may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR,
EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are
the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as
benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds,
which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For
example, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that certain LIBOR
settings will permanently cease immediately after December 31, 2021 or after June 30, 2023, as applicable (the
“FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the FCA will no longer require any panel banks
to continue to submit LIBOR beyond the date from which the panel banks have notified their departure, or to
require the ICE Benchmark Association to continue to publish LIBOR on the basis of panel banks submissions
beyond such dates. It follows that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no
longer be representative immediately after the dates set out in the FCA Announcement. The International Swaps
and Derivatives Association has further announced on March 5, 2021 that the FCA Announcement constitutes an
index cessation event under the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for all
LIBOR settings. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of
administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to
the manner in which a benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions,
or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to,
the Revolving Credit Facility having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any
such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged

67


-----

increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark,
changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies
could result in changes to the manner in which a benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to
the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark
(including but not limited to the Revolving Credit Facility).

Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged
increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest. Various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are the subject of
recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to
be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, as amended). In
addition, the FCA Announcement indicates that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any
administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, as
applicable. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working
Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling
Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is
established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA
have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the
potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such
benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology
or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain
benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in
particular be aware that (i) any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant
interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be
lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be and (ii) from the cessation date of LIBOR, the rate of
interest applicable to our sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions,
although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered
quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the
availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective
application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available.

More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR
could affect our ability to meet our obligations under its sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse
effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, its sources of funding. Changes in the manner of
administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the conditions applicable to our sources of funding or
other consequences relevant to our sources of funding. No assurance can be provided that changes will not be
made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_The Issuer, Holdco and any other provider of Collateral will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow each of the Issuer (and following the Post Completion
Merger, MergerCo), Holdco and any other pledgor or grantor of Collateral, as applicable, to remain in possession
of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral
to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain
conditions, the Issuer (and following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo), Holdco and any other pledgor or
grantor of Collateral, as applicable, may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the
Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture and making ordinary course
cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the
Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the
case of an enforcement of the liens on the Collateral.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholders may not correspond with the interests of the holders of the Notes.
Upon completion of the Acquisition, the Issuer will be indirectly controlled by Itelyum Co-Investment LP, whose

68


-----

ultimate general partner is Bay Fox Verde GP Limited and whose partnership interests are held by SSCP Fund IV, a
fund whose ultimate general partner is Stirling Square Capital Partners Fourth Fund GP Limited, and other SSCP
co-investors. See “Principal Shareholders.” The interests of Stirling Square Capital Partners or its affiliates could
conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to
pay our debts when due. For example, Stirling Square Capital Partners and its affiliates could vote to cause us to incur
additional indebtedness. In addition, Stirling Square Capital Partners and its affiliates may hold interests in suppliers or
customers of the Target Group. Stirling Square Capital Partners or its affiliates may also have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance
their equity investments, although such transactions might also involve risk to the holders of the Notes, and may, in the
future, own businesses that directly compete direct or indirectly with us or that operate in our markets or adjacent
markets. In addition, certain minority investors, comprised of DBAG and the Management Investors will indirectly
own approximately 29% and 7%, respectively, of the share capital of the Target. In connection with the Transactions,
Itelyum Co-investment LP and DBAG Diamante Investment S.à r.l. have entered into an investment and shareholder
agreement which sets forth, among other things, that the consent of DBAG is required for certain reserved matters,
including, among other things, making material acquisitions and/or disposals of assets. See “Principal Shareholders.”

**_No assurance or representation is given by us, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion_**
**_provider or any External Reviewer as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of any_**
**_opinion, report (including our Sustainability Reports and Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework),_**
**_certification or validation of any third party in connection with the Offering or the Sustainability Performance_**
**_Targets to fulfil any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other criteria. The Notes are not_**
**_“green bonds.” Moreover, the CO2 Baseline presented herein has not been independently verified or audited_**
**_by any third party. There will be limited consequences under the Indenture for our failure to meet the_**
**_Sustainability Performance Targets._**

Although we target an increase in gross CO2 avoided emissions and the quantity of waste collected and delivered
to circular treatments, there can be no assurance of the extent to which we will be successful in doing so or that
the sustainability-linked features of the Notes will satisfy an investor’s requirements for any future legal or quasilegal standards for investment in assets with any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other
criteria, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing
rule or investment portfolio mandates, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental,
sustainability or social impact.

No assurance or representation is given by us, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion provider or
any External Reviewer as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of our Sustainability Reports and
Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework or of any opinion of any third party (whether or not solicited by us) that may
be made available in connection with our Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, our Sustainability Performance
Targets or the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework and any such opinion are
not and shall not be deemed to be incorporated into and/or form part of this Offering Memorandum. Any such opinion
is not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation by us, the Trustee or any Initial Purchaser, or any other person to
buy, sell or hold the Notes. Any such opinion is only current as of the date that opinion was initially issued. Prospective
investors must determine for themselves the relevance of any such opinion and/or the information contained therein
and/or the provider of such opinion for the purpose of any investment in the Notes. The second party opinion providers
and providers of similar opinions, certifications and validations are not currently subject to any specific regulatory or
other regime or oversight. The holders of the Notes have no recourse against us, any of the Trustee, the Initial
Purchasers or the provider of any such opinion or certification for the contents of any such opinion or certification. In
addition, the CO2 Baseline for the year ended December 2020 in respect of the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target
has not been independently verified, audited or otherwise reviewed by the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers or any other
third party. Accordingly, while the Issuer has calculated the CO2 Baseline in good faith, there are risks that such CO2
Baseline may be inaccurate, which may adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to achieve the Gross CO2 Avoided
Emissions Target or may otherwise facilitate such achievement. Moreover, the Issuer has no obligation to modify or
otherwise change the SLB Baselines in the future.

The Notes are not being marketed as green bonds. We expect to use the proceeds from this Offering to fund the
purchase price of the Acquisition, to repay the Existing Itelyum Debt in full and to pay costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions, and therefore we do not intend to allocate the net proceeds
specifically to projects or business activities meeting environmental or sustainability criteria or be subject to any
other limitations associated with green bonds.

In addition, although we will be required to pay a Step-up Premium upon the redemption of the Notes at maturity
or prior thereto under certain circumstances if we fail to achieve one or both of the Sustainability Performance

69


-----

Targets, the failure to achieve any such targets, the failure to deliver a Sustainability Report and/or the failure to
receive an Assurance Letter will not be a default or event of default under the Indenture nor will any such event
trigger any requirement to repurchase or redeem the Notes.

Moreover, the Step-up Premium will not be payable on the Notes in certain circumstances, such as in connection
with a change of control offer or an asset disposition offer, upon an acceleration of the Notes or in connection
with certain optional redemption features. Furthermore, any acquisition or divestment by the Itelyum Group shall
be taken into account in the calculation but shall not result in a change of the calculation methodology or a
recalibration of the Sustainability Performance Targets or the SLB Baselines. See “Description of Notes.”

**_Certain of the Collateral will not secure the Notes until no later than 30 Business Days from the Completion_**
**_Date or within 90 days of the consummation of the Post Completion Merger._**

The Post Completion Date Collateral will be granted within 30 Business Days after the Completion Date and
certain other Collateral will only be granted and/or confirmed (as applicable) within 90 days of the
consummation of the Post Completion Merger or within 90 days of the Cut-Off Date, as further described under
“Description of Notes—Security.” There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring
such liens within the time periods specified, the failure of which would result in an “event of default” under the
Indenture. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Revolving Credit Facility
and otherwise as set forth under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Description of Notes—Security,” which limitations could be_
significant. See also “—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement
_and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability.”_

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of all of the_**
**_Issuer’s (or MergerCo’s) subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will be Guarantors of the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors,
trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer or MergerCo, as
applicable, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are
made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer or MergerCo, as
applicable, and the Guarantors of the Notes. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary of the
Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise
wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

 - the creditors of the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, and any Guarantors (if any), including the holders of
the Notes, will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary; and

 - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors, preferred stockholders (if
any), will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such
subsidiary before the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, or any Guarantors (if any), as a direct or indirect
shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including depositors,
trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Issuer or MergerCo,
as applicable. As of June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s subsidiaries
which are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had €9.7 million in outstanding financial debt
(excluding liabilities under recourse factoring of €11.6 million and excluding debt owed by Castiglia),
€2.8 million of which was secured over asset that do not constitute Collateral, which would have ranked
structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations,
permit the guarantors and non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such
incurrence constituting a default under the Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture
will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables in the
ordinary course of business that may be incurred by non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

The Indenture also will not limit the transfer of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of our restricted
subsidiaries, including our restricted subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. As payments on the Notes are
only required to be made by Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, and the Guarantors, no payments are required to
be made from assets of subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes unless those assets are transferred by
dividend or otherwise to the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, or one of the Guarantors.

70


-----

Moreover, any Guarantees would be subject to the significant limitations described under “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”_
and, accordingly, the Notes would be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any Guarantors to the extent
that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or secured by such Guarantors.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and_**
**_the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral._**

Holdco, the Issuer, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification and, following the Post Completion Merger,
MergerCo, are or will be incorporated and organized under the laws of Italy. Enforcement of the obligations
under a Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such person will be subject to
certain defenses available to the Issuer (and following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo) or the relevant
Guarantor or the security provider, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, transactions under value, corporate benefit, capital
maintenance, preservation of share capital, liquidity maintenance, voidable preferences, thin capitalization or
similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, by limiting the amounts
recoverable under the Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be
limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a Guarantor or security provider under
applicable law, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or
security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the
relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital
maintenance, financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory
laws and/or would cause the directors of such Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties
and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without
a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Guarantee to its
beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain
defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the
Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. As
a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon
the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it.

It is possible that a Guarantor or creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of
a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee on any of the above
grounds and the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent
that agreed limitations on the Guarantees obligation apply, the Notes would to that extent be structurally
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future
Guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. The
obligations of each Guarantor, the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee and the obligations of the grantor of
security and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce on the Collateral will be limited under the Indenture to
the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor or provided by the grantor of security under the
applicable laws of Italy, which has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in
violations of laws related to, among others, corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial
assistance or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the relevant Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under
applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such
Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law for providing such Guarantee.

In particular, enforcement of any Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or pledgor would be
subject to certain defenses available to guarantors or security providers generally or, in some cases, to limitations
contained in the terms of the relevant Guarantee or pledges of security designed to ensure compliance with
statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors or security providers. These laws and defenses
include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or

71


-----

similar laws and regulation or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, the liability of a
Guarantor under its Guarantee or of a security provider could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on
the amounts of its other obligations and the law applicable to it.

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and
corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, and/or the Intercreditor Agreement, as regards to any Guarantor incorporated under the laws
of Italy (an “Italian Guarantor”):

(i) the Guarantees and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at any time
an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans advanced from time to time
to the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the
Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, and
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee and/or of security granted by such
Italian Guarantor, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee
under the Revolving Credit Facility, and/or the Intercreditor Agreement, and/or received upon the
enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian
Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian
Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione)
arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount
of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor
will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal
to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that
time; and

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations
of any of the Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest
qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded
in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the
Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively.

In the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-off Date, as regards to Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law
and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantee and security interests to be granted by Itelyum Regeneration will only guarantee and secure
the 1ssuer’s obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes and shall not
exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including
the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan) advanced from time to time to Itelyum Regeneration (or any of its
direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether
directly or indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement
of the relevant Guarantee and/or of security granted by Itelyum Regeneration, in each case net of any
proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/
or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by
Itelyum Regeneration; provided that Itelyum Regeneration shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of
any amounts in excess of the amount that Itelyum Regeneration is entitled to set-off against its claims of
recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by Itelyum
Regeneration under its Guarantee;

(ii) the Guarantee and security interests to be granted by Itelyum Purification will only guarantee and secure the
1ssuer’s obligations under Tranche C (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes and shall not exceed at
any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including the
Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan) advanced from time to time to Itelyum Purification (or any of its direct
or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or

72


-----

indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the
relevant Guarantee and/or of security granted by Itelyum Purification, in each case net of any proceeds
already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by Itelyum
Purification; provided that Itelyum Purification shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts
in excess of the amount that Itelyum Purification is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or
subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by Itelyum Purification
under its Guarantee;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Itelyum Regeneration, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche B
(as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, in each case and from time to time, by an
amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied
by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche B (as defined in “Use
_of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes;_

(iv) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Itelyum Purification, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche C
(as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, in each case and from time to time, by an
amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied
by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche C (as defined in “Use
_of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes;_

(v) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by Itelyum Regeneration
and Itelyum Purification, respectively, will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of
a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by
Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, respectively, at that time;

(vi) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (a) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (b) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations
of each of Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not
extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on
overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil
Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and

(vii) any guarantee, indemnity, obligation and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee
and/or security interest by:

(A) Itelyum Regeneration does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment
obligations under Tranche B under the Notes; and

(B) Itelyum Purification does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment
obligations under Tranche C under the Notes.

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the
relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of, respectively,
Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian
financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in
Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate
the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to
support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, Itelyum Regeneration
and Itelyum Purification. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests granted by, respectively, Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions
regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such
Guarantee and/or security interests could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if
and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance,
including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to each of Itelyum

73


-----

Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification will be deemed to have no
liability thereunder and the respective Guarantee shall not be in force and effect.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental
indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian
Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among
others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to
pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant
security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably
concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security
provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or
the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari
_passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice_
versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the Guarantees and
the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/
or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor
Agreement, and the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related
thereto, shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction
documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such
guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the
limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a
Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must
be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and
expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture).
It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee
could be declared void.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Other limitations pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency laws apply to the Guarantees._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct
that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for
the benefit of that Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court
found that:

 - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when
the granting of the relevant Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or the creditor was
aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when the relevant Guarantee was given;

 - the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit
for the relevant Guarantee or the relevant Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the
relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

 - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or not to be in the
best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant Guarantor; or

74


-----

 - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted
under applicable law.

It is possible that a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or the
bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, may contest the validity
and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee or grantor’s creation of security on any of the aforementioned
grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or the relevant security interest should be
limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in
part, or to the extent such limitations on the Guarantee or security obligation apply, the Notes would be
effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or grantor, including trade payables of such
Guarantor or grantor to the extent of such limitations. Future pledges or guarantees may be subject to similar
limitations.

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency
trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be
unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed
to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery
than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within
a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is
voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory
priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such
claims are secured claims. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) and_**
**_future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor_**
**_Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from_**
**_the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement will include provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the
Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,
including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned over amounts and other
recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions towards discharging certain super senior obligations
(including, among others, those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations (if any) and
future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts towards
discharging the Notes. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all obligations
under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any
other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.” Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also_
secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such,
the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes are secured on a first-ranking basis with security interests over the Collateral
that also secure our obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that
the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the
Indenture will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action.

The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so in accordance with the
provisions described in the following paragraphs.

If either (i) the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders,
creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain
non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50%

75


-----

of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) or
(ii) the creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the
“Super Majority Super Senior Creditors”) wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver those
instructions to the Security Agent and the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and/or the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors, in each case subject to the consultation period of 15
days as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement; however, (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super
Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of the end of the consultation period
(or within 6 months of any notice delivered by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors to the Security Agent
notifying the Security Agent and the creditor representatives of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Super
Senior Creditors that the Collateral has become enforceable, if no consultation period is required) or (ii) the
Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action within three months of the end of the consultation
period (or within 3 months of any notice delivered by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors to the Security
Agent notifying the Security Agent and the creditor representatives of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Super
Senior Creditors that the Collateral has become enforceable, if no consultation period is required) or (iii) an
insolvency event has occurred with respect to a relevant company and the Security Agent has not commenced
any enforcement action at that time with respect to such relevant company, then the Security Agent will act in
accordance with the enforcement instructions provided by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” No consultation shall be required
(and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors) shall be entitled to
give any instructions to the Security Agent to take any enforcement action prior to the end of the consultation
period, where: (a) any of the Collateral has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting a
relevant company; or (b) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors
determine in good faith (and notifies each other representative agent of the other creditors party to the
Intercreditor Agreement) that any delay caused by such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the
amount likely to be realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full or to have a material
adverse effect on the ability to effect an enforcement or a distressed disposal and, in each case any instructions
will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or the Super
Senior Creditors on behalf of which the relevant instructing group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in
accordance with the instructions first received.

In the event that conflicting instructions (and, for these purposes, failure to give instructions is deemed to be a
conflicting instruction) are received by the end of the consultation period (and have not been resolved), the
Security Agent shall take any enforcement action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, with such instructions to comply in each case with the security enforcement principles
contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of all instructions received from the Super Majority Super
Senior Creditors during the consultation period shall be deemed revoked.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions until it has been
indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction (including by way of payment in advance or otherwise).

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting
interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of such
indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of
the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under
the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In
addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a
result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the relevant
Guarantee and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the relevant Guarantee may
be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description
_of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not
have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a

76


-----

result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the
Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for_**
**_the Notes and other secured indebtedness may be secured by assets that do not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral. See “Description of Notes—Security.”
Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to
secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property and assets that do not secure the
Notes. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the
Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the
holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property
or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by
assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of
the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such
secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. As of June 30, 2021, after
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its subsidiaries would have had €2.8 million of
indebtedness secured by assets that will not secure the Notes.

While the Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional Guarantees and grant additional security
over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of granting liens in favor of other indebtedness or
the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations will be subject to certain
exceptions and qualifications pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles. See “Description of Notes—Security—
_General.” The Agreed Security Principles set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes_
to be granted security or Guarantee in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles
may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or
security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles
may affect the value of the Collateral.

In particular, even though the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to share the same Collateral
and Guarantors’ package, this may not always continue to be the case and circumstances may arise in the future
in which lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or
guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application
of the Agreed Security Principles and, ultimately, Italian financial assistance and corporate benefit rules.
Accordingly, in such circumstances holders of the Notes would have no direct claim for payment against any
such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect to any such additional collateral.

**_The principal amount of the receivables forming part of the Collateral may be reduced as a result of_**
**_prepayments of such loans prior to the maturity date of the Notes._**

On the Completion Date, the Issuer will enter into the Itelyum Proceeds Loans, the proceeds of which are
expected to be used by each of Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification to, inter alia, effect the repayment
and discharge of the Existing Itelyum Debt on the Completion Date or as soon as practicable thereafter. See “Use
_of Proceeds.” Prior to completion of the Post Completion Merger, repayments of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans_
prior to the maturity date of the Notes would result in a reduction in the liability owed by Itelyum Regeneration
and Itelyum Purification, respectively, to the Issuer and any reduction in the principal amount of the relevant
Itelyum Proceeds Loans would reduce the value of such receivable and of the Completion Date Collateral and, if
Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification guarantees and/or secures the Notes after the Cut-Off Date, the
value of the Guarantee by Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification and any security interests granted by
Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. Any reduction in the principal amount of the Itelyum Proceeds
Loans could also adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes if the Issuer is
otherwise unable to cause its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make loans or other distributions to it. Subject to
certain significant exceptions, the Itelyum Proceeds Loans documentation, however, will prohibit the repayment,
reduction, extinction or equitization of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans. Such exceptions include, but are not limited
to, the repayment of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans to enable the Issuer to make payments of principal and interest
on the Notes and, upon request of the Issuer, the partial repayment of (i) the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan
in an amount not exceeding €15 million during the tenor of the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan; and (ii) the
Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan in an amount not exceeding €12 million during the tenor of the Itelyum
Purification Proceeds Loan. The Indenture will not include any restrictions on the Issuer, Itelyum Regeneration

77


-----

or Itelyum Purification to amend the Itelyum Proceeds Loans documentation, including to permit the repayment
of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans in order to allow the Issuer to discharge other debt secured by the Collateral. See
also “—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue
_generating operations of its own and prior to the Post Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from_
_the operating companies of the Target Group to be able to make payments on the Notes.” The security interests_
in the Itelyum Proceeds Loans will cease to exist automatically upon completion of the Post Completion Merger.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Itelyum Proceeds Loans” and “Description of Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The Collateral is limited to certain specific assets, the value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under_**
**_certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets
underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the
security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. As described elsewhere, the
extent of the Collateral is limited and, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, Guarantees and/or
security shall only be granted by certain entities. See “Description of Notes—Security.”

Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property and certain other assets of the Issuer and
the restricted subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has
been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges and the
amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other
things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale,
the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located
and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may
provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid and
its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral
will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event
of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group
of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry
into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any direct or indirect transfer of our operations
may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings similar to
(or different from) those that have been or will be required to be obtained in relation to the Acquisition or the
Post Completion Merger, or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time
to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of
operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will
not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount
of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure
the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity
whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged
entity.

As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in
the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of
the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim
against the Issuer’s and any Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes
on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties are secured by liens,
including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or
third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to such assets which, if exercised, could reduce the
proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. In particular by operation of the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, security interests in the Collateral may be released if a lien is granted on the Collateral
in favor of other indebtedness so long as such lien is a Permitted Collateral Lien (as defined under “Description

78


-----

_of Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”). Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the_
Indenture, holders of such Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered
hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The Collateral and the Guarantees will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other_**
**_imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the_**
**_Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections_**
**_could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the Guarantee, as well as the ability of the security Agent_**
**_to realize or foreclose on such Collateral and the Guarantee. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of_**
**_security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection_**
**_requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The granting of the Guarantees and_**
**_security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the_**
**_future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the_**
**_laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening, clawback or
voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The granting
of shared security interests, including in connection with any release and retake of such security interest, to
secure existing, new or future indebtedness (such as hedging obligations or any additional Notes issued under the
Indenture) or the transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or reopen hardening or clawback
periods in certain jurisdictions, including Italy. The applicable hardening, clawback or voidance period for these
new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended,
shared or recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void, ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, in case any security
interests (including security interests in the Collateral) is released and retaken at any time, such release and
retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of such security
interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts
could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several
circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity
interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations.” See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of
_Liens.” In Italy, for example, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in_
respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and
the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding
paragraph.

Similar considerations also apply following the Completion Date, in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional guarantors of the Notes and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets
and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted
under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The
existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the
value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.
Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the
timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The
Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in
collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest.
The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have
the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be complicated,_**
**_involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate._**

In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding debt obligations,
any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt of such entity, which could result
in a taxable capital gain to such entities. As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares

79


-----

of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In
addition, the Indenture will not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future.
Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the
Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce
the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over
the shares of the Issuer may be limited.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will not be
granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not
have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of
a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions
of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italian law. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but
require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under
the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified
as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be
enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of Italy). In
certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the
creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the
Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt
provisions would not be applicable provided Italian case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the
pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests
for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under parallel debt structures, the
Parallel Debt will typically be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel
Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In
respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except
through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of
the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities
and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law,
and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not
validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not
receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and
perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the
holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision
(introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond
issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then
be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or
available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a
_rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_
of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified
therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security
interests created under the Security Documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes

-----

could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under
the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
**period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after the**
Offering. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given
statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even
if such claims are secured claims. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory provisions
of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the
Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements.

In case of insolvency of any Guarantor, the enforcement of any Collateral provided by such Guarantor may be
subject to certain restrictions. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as
applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens.
Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security
interest, the holder of the security interest having difficulty enforcing such holder’s right in Collateral or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee
in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral, which may have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive proceeds from any enforcement of the
Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps
or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will_**
**_be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee or the Security Agent._**

Pursuant to the Indenture, under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically, including a sale or other disposition of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the
asset sale covenant of the Indenture, in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement or, after the Post Completion Merger, in connection with certain initial public equity offerings. See
_“Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more_
restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors of the Notes as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as
an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such
subsidiary and any Guarantee of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to
certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the
Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its
subsidiaries.

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all_**
**_noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes._**

The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of Notes—Meeting of Holders of Notes,” the
majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more
persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These
provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders
of the Notes, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of
Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an
extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for
payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to
redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change

81


-----

the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to
change the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and
may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of more than one half
of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is
untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged,
may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the consequence that the majority voting threshold may be reduced
from 75% to 50%. Furthermore, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to
vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in
meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also largely untested in the Italian courts.

**_The insolvency laws of Italy and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar, other_**
**_limitations on the Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance_**
**_statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Italy. There is a rebuttable presumption that the
“center of main interest” as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) is the jurisdiction where the
registered office is situated.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws
of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the
Issuer, a Guarantor or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are
untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the
event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in
jurisdictions you may be familiar with).

As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in an insolvency
situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Although laws differ across jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable
principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such
jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee
against a Guarantor, the enforceability of any other guarantee of the Notes and the enforceability of the security
interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest or the Guarantee
if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and
insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined
under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency administrator
may challenge the Guarantee and the security interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences,
transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such
laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

 - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the security interests
provided by such security provider;

 - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security
interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the
Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

 - take other action that is detrimental to you.

82


-----

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or security interests are found to be a
preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or if otherwise set aside, we
cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the
liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the
amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.

The amount recoverable from the Guarantor and security providers under the Security Documents will also be
limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination
of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may
be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Guarantees and the
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “—Corporate benefit, financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely_
_affect the validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for
example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the security interests created, the Guarantors
or security provider:

 - issued such Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding
current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after
its insolvency;

 - issued such Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a
shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or
security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or security interest knew or should have
known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made;

 - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or
security interest on the basis that the Guarantee or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only
indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or
rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the security interest, or
subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business
transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended
to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they
would become due;

 - the Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of
insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor or collateral provider; or

 - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally
may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any security
interest if:

 - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

 - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

 - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that we and the Target Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the
Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantee were issued or the security interests
were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or
security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a
Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the security interests were
created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to
secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors

83


-----

under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect
period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year
prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or
undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual
means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby
the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any
clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove
his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action
during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and
payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured
obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the
insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity
in order to enforce any clawback action. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._

Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis
creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition,
under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency
declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period
prior to insolvency. In addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the
various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU.

If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided,
the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts
under the related Security Documents.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantee and security
interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Our right to receive payments under the Itelyum Proceeds Loans may be subordinated by law to the_**
**_obligations of other creditors._**

Italian corporate law (articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity
subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a
company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other
creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into
account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness
compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and
not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one
year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions
summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 also applies to companies incorporated
as società per azioni, hence potentially to Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification under the relevant
Itelyum Proceeds Loans.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it cannot be excluded
that a court may find the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions of the Italian Civil Code to be
applicable in respect of the relevant Itelyum Proceeds Loan borrowed by Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum
Purification. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that Itelyum Regeneration’s and Itelyum Purification’s

84


-----

obligations under the relevant Itelyum Proceeds Loan are subordinated to all its obligations to other creditors.
Should any of Itelyum Regeneration’s and Itelyum Purification’s obligations under the relevant Itelyum Proceeds
Loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to
the equity, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the
Itelyum Proceeds Loan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment
obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any
intercompany loans (including the Itelyum Proceeds Loans) or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the
ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes
or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Guarantee to be provided by
Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification) may be impaired or restricted.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Guarantee have not been, and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs
in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all
other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation
of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries
comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be
limited. The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no market. We cannot assure you as to:

 - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

 - your ability to sell your Notes; or

 - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including the liquidity of the market for the
Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic
conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as third-party recommendations.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that
have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a general
decline in the market for similar securities. In addition, the trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. The Initial Purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue
such market-making at any time without notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market
for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained, and any disruption in the trading
market for the Notes may have a negative effect on your investment regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or
remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to
trading on the Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes (whether or not
for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange), as applicable, from the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary
market.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable_**
**_security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption”
and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due to such an
early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate
as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset_**
**_disposition offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all_**
**_outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to
purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the
Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer and may need
to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing
on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under agreements
governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness (even if such change
of control under such other indebtedness may be deemed not to be a change of control for the purposes of the
Indenture). Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a
default under the Indenture.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or
other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control
as defined in the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.”

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence an asset
disposition offer (as defined under the Indenture) to all holders of the Notes pursuant to which we will be
obligated to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock.”_

In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will also have the right to redeem the
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price
offered to each other holder of the Notes (provided that such price shall not be less than 100% of the principal
amount). See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant laws and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

The definition of “change of control” and the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of_
all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any person.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly
established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction
and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of
uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and
whether the Issuer are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Italian tax legislation may restrict the deductibility of all or a portion of the interest expense on our_**
**_indebtedness, including interest expense in respect of the Notes._**

Current tax legislation in Italy (provided for by Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986
(“Article 96”), as amended by Legislative Decree No. 142 of November 29, 2018) allows for the full tax
deductibility of interest expense incurred by the Issuer in each fiscal year up to the amount of the interest income
of the same fiscal year, as evidenced by the relevant annual financial statements. A further deduction of interest
expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of EBITDA (i.e., risultato operativo lordo
_della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”), as well as 30% of ROL carried forward from previous fiscal years. The_
ROL is calculated on the basis of the value of the items of the Issuer’s profit and loss account, which are
comprised of the operating gross revenues and expenses (excluding depreciation of tangible and intangible
assets, as well as leasing fees), as determined through the application of the tax rules concerning the

86


-----

determination of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the
amount of interest expense in a fiscal year can be carried forward for the following five fiscal years. The amount
of any interest income exceeding the interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward without time limits.
Interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years and
deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds
interest income (also carried forward from previous fiscal years) is lower than 30% of ROL. In the case of an
Italian tax group (consolidato fiscale nazionale), interest expense not deducted by an entity within the tax group
due to lack interest income or of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess
interest income and excess of ROL of the other companies within the tax group. This 30% threshold applies to
the Italian subsidiaries of the Issuer only. Article 96 does not apply to certain entities active in the insurance and
financial sector.

In addition, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leverage buyout transactions
with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However,
on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter No. 6/E (“Circular Letter”) clarifying, as
a common principle, that interest on the acquisition bank loan in leveraged buy-out transactions are generally
deductible for IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in Article 96 and excluding certain cases
of reinvestment (also partial) by the seller(s). In case an acquisition is considered as entered into by one or more
entities that are related parties to the seller(s), the deduction of interest expenses may be challenged by the tax
authorities based on anti-abuse provisions, depending on the existence of non-marginal business reasons for the
debt-financed acquisition.

In addition, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to
challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used,
in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing
transaction appear less favorable than the ones of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such
circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing does
not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic” and as
such not compliant with the “inherence” principle set out under Italian tax law). Italian tax laws and
pronouncements of the tax authorities are subject to change and positions that the Target Group takes for tax
purposes may be challenged.

Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to
make a refinancing under the “inherence” principle and/or to make an acquisition under the anti-abuse provision,
we may be unable to deduct our interest expenses and/or be subject to significant penalties or other consequences
that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to
service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

Moreover, (i) any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation or application (including any future
limitation on the use of the ROL of the Issuer and its subsidiaries), (ii) the tax treatment of interest expense
arising from any indebtedness, including the Notes, (iii) the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements
relating to the deductibility of interest expense or (iv) a change in the interpretation and application by Italian tax
authorities of Italian tax law, may result in our inability to fully deduct our interest expense, which may have an
adverse impact on our financial condition.

**_No assurance can be given that the listing of the Notes will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree No. 239._**

No assurance can be given that the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
will satisfy the listing requirement of Decree No. 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the
provisions of such legislation relating to the exemption from withholding tax.

The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among others, the listing requirement of the
aforementioned legislation that may be interpreted to require that the Notes be listed upon their issuance to
benefit from the aforementioned provisions, including the exemption from withholding tax. According to a strict
interpretation of such circular, the Notes may not be eligible to benefit from such provision if the listing of the
Notes is not effective as of the Issue Date. In the event that the Notes are not listed or that such listing
requirement is not satisfied, payments of interest, premium and other income with respect to the Notes would be
subject to a withholding tax, currently at a rate of 26% and, subject to certain exceptions, see “Description of
_Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we would be required to pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding_
taxes such that holders receive a net amount that is not less than the amount that they would have received in the

87


-----

absence of such withholding. The imposition of withholding taxes with respect to payments on the Notes and the
resulting obligation to pay, subject to certain exemptions, additional amounts to holders of the Notes could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Italian withholding taxes or deduction may be payable on amounts paid by an Italian resident Guarantor._**

Under a certain interpretation, payments made to non-resident entities without an Italian permanent establishment
to which the Notes are effectively connected by an Italian resident Guarantor may be subject to Italian
withholding taxes or deduction of taxes. The possible imposition of withholding taxes or deduction of taxes with
respect to payments on the Notes and the resulting obligation to pay additional amounts to Holders of the Notes
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements to apply the Italian tax regime provided by_**
**_Decree No. 239 will be met._**

The regime provided by Decree No. 239 and in particular the exemption from withholding tax in principle
granted to Holders of the Notes who are the beneficial owners of the proceeds from the Notes (or, if the Holders
are institutional investors not subject to tax, even if they are not the beneficial owners of the Notes) and who are
resident in countries included in the White List applies if certain procedural requirements are met. It is not
possible to assure that all non-Italian resident investors (including beneficial owners of the Rule 144A Notes) can
claim the application of the withholding tax exemption where the relevant foreign intermediary fails to provide
sufficient information to the relevant Italian tax authorities under the procedures set for applying the exemption
regime. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian Tax Considerations.”

**_Changes in tax laws or regulations or in positions by the relevant Italian authority regarding the application,_**
**_administration or interpretation of tax laws or regulations, particularly if applied retrospectively, could have_**
**_negative effects on our current business model and have a material adverse effect on our operating results,_**
**_business and financial condition._**

Tax laws are complex and subject to subjective evaluations and interpretative decisions, and we will be
periodically subject to tax audits aimed at assessing our compliance with direct and indirect taxes. The tax
authorities may not agree with our interpretations of, or with the positions we have taken or intend to take on, tax
laws applicable to our ordinary activities and extraordinary transactions. In case of objections by the tax
authorities to our interpretations, we could face long tax proceedings that could result in the payment of penalties
or sanctions and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, business and financial condition. We
may also inadvertently or for reasons beyond our control fail to comply with certain tax laws or regulations in
connection with a particular transaction. This may have a negative tax impact and may also result in the
application of penalties or sanctions. We cannot, therefore, rule out that claims by the tax authorities may give
rise to burdensome and long tax litigation and to the payment of significant amounts for taxes, penalties and
interest for late payment. This might negatively affect our economic and financial condition.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the
value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the
value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if the Notes receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes issued under the Indenture
receive an investment grade rating from any two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, and no default or event of default

88


-----

has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as the Notes are no longer
rated investment grade by such ratings agencies, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See
_“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade_
_Status.” At any time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur_
additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of
which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever
achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_Upon an IPO pushdown, certain Collateral and Guarantees may be released, any retaken Collateral may be_**
**_subject to hardening periods, and U.S. holders may have U.S. federal income tax consequences._**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering (as defined under “Description of Notes”), the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such
provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the
Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice and
provided that such date falls on or after the date on which the Post Completion Merger is completed) as described
in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or transfer of
_claims and liabilities in respect of the Notes and the Transaction Security—Provisions following an IPO.” The_
Indenture will provide that, upon consummation of an IPO pushdown, among other things, certain Collateral or
Guarantees may be released. Moreover, we may elect to, but are under no obligation to, revoke or otherwise
reverse an IPO pushdown, or to replace any Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant thereto, in the event that
such IPO pushdown is not consummated. To the extent that new security documents in respect of any collateral
to be retaken (including, for example, a pledge over the shares of the Issuer) are entered into, such collateral may
be subject to new hardening periods.

In addition, in the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or transfer of claims
_and liabilities in respect of the Notes and the Transaction Security—Provisions following an IPO,” such change_
in the Issuer could result in a taxable exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If so, U.S. Holders would recognize any gain or loss in connection with such taxable exchange
(although any such loss could be disallowed) and would have a new holding period and new tax basis in the
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, if the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the
IPO pushdown is less than the principal amount of the Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount), such Notes may be treated as issued with OID. Please see “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the EU financial transaction tax, if adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a
Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“EU FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (the “Participating Member States”). On December 8,
2015, Estonia indicated that it would no longer be a Participating Member State. The Commission’s Proposal is
still pending before the Council of the EU and its status is regularly discussed at the European and Financial
Affairs Council. Moreover, in the course of 2020, the European Commission brought to the attention of the
Council of the EU and the EU Parliament the possibility to propose, by June 2024, the introduction of a reshaped
EU FTT as a new EU own resource. The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and, if introduced in its
current form, could apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain
circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes provided
that at least one party to the transaction is established or deemed established in a Participating Member State and
that there is a financial institution established or deemed established in a Participating Member State which is
party to the transaction, acting either for its own account or for the account of another person, or acting in the
name of a party to the transaction. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a
Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person
established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings
is issued in a Participating Member State.

89


-----

The Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may,
therefore, be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member
States may decide to participate and/or other Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If the
Commission’s Proposal or any similar tax were adopted, transactions in the Notes could be subject to higher
costs and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished.

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisers in relation to the consequences of the EU FTT
associated with purchasing and disposing of the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes are unlikely to be entitled to a gross-up for any Italian withholding taxes, unless such_**
**_Italian withholding tax is caused solely by our failure to comply with certain procedures._**

We are organized under the laws of Italy and are resident in Italy for tax purposes and therefore payments of
principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain or payment on the Notes, may be
subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. All payments made by us or on our behalf in respect of the Notes will
be made free and clear of withholding or deduction of Italian taxation, unless the withholding or deduction is
required by law. In that event, subject to a number of exceptions, we must pay such additional amounts as will
result in the holders of the Notes receiving the amounts as they would have received in respect of such Notes had
no such withholding or deduction been required. We will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders
of the Notes under certain circumstances, including if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to
Decree No. 239 or pursuant to Decree No. 461, except where the procedures prescribed by Decree No. 239 and/
or by Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been complied with solely due to our (or
our agents’) actions or omissions. In such circumstances where we would not be liable to pay additional amounts,
investors subject to Italian withholding tax will only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes.
See “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain Italian Tax
_Considerations.”_

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239
or Decree No. 461 where a holder of Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country or territory included in the
White List, and such holder complies with certain certification requirements, there can be no assurance that this
will be the case. Moreover, holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 after the date
of this Offering Memorandum, including any change in the White List.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks or other adverse tax consequences as a result of investing in_**
**_the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the Notes will
entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below
their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to U.S. investors on a U.S. dollar basis. Investing in the Notes
by U.S. investors also may have significant tax consequences. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes are issued in exchange for
book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will
not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the sole registered holders of the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the relevant Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to The Bank of New
York Mellon, London Branch, as Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream.
Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global
Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and, if you are not a participant in Euroclear and Clearstream on the procedures of the participant
through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the
Indenture.

90


-----

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if
you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance
that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any
matters or timely basis.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered Notes are
issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting
through Euroclear and Clearstream. The Issuer cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be €450.0 million. If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more
than one business day after the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Notes will be deposited into the Escrow
Account held in the name of the Issuer but controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged in favor of the Trustee on
behalf of the relevant holders of the Notes. Upon release from the Escrow Account, the proceeds from the
Offering will be used, together with the proceeds from the Equity Contribution and cash on balance sheet of the
Target Group, to fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, to repay the Existing Itelyum Debt in full and to
pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the
table below. Actual amounts are subject to adjustment and may differ from estimated amounts at the time of the
consummation of the Acquisition, depending on several factors, including differences from our estimate of fees
and expenses, the timing of the Completion Date. This table should be read in conjunction with “Capitalization.”

(1) Represents the gross proceeds from the Offering, assuming the Notes are issued at par.
(2) Represents the equity investment expected to be made by Itelyum Co-Investment LP, whose ultimate general partner is Bay Fox Verde
GP Limited and whose partnership interests are held by SSCP Fund IV and SSCP co-investors, and DBAG, which will be contributed as
equity through intermediate holding companies to the Issuer on or prior to the Completion Date for purposes of the Acquisition. For
further information, see “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure,” “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition” and
_“Principal Shareholders.”_
(3) Represents a portion of the available cash at the Target Group. For further information, see footnote (1) under “Capitalization.”
(4) Represents the estimated purchase price payable to the Sellers for the equity interests in the Target to be acquired under the Acquisition
Agreement assuming that the Completion Date will occur on September 30, 2021, to be financed by using the proceeds from the Equity
Contribution and a portion of the proceeds from virtual tranche A (“Tranche A”) under the Notes for an estimated €269.6 million, as
further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing.” The purchase price payable at the Completion Date may differ
from the amount presented, depending on the actual timing of the Completion Date and the potential occurrence of certain Leakages, as
further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition.”
(5) Represents the following amounts outstanding as of June 30, 2021: (i) existing indebtedness of Itelyum Regeneration under the Itelyum
Regeneration Senior Facilities Agreement, liabilities under the 2016 Vendor Loan Agreement and liabilities under certain hedging
derivative instruments, to be fully repaid and canceled via cash on balance sheet and the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan with the
funds available under tranche B under the Notes (“Tranche B”) for an aggregate amount of approximately €82.3 million and certain
available cash at the Target Group; and (ii) indebtedness of Itelyum Purification under the Itelyum Purification Senior Facilities
Agreement, liabilities under the 2017 Vendor Loan Agreement and liabilities under certain hedging derivative instruments, to be fully
repaid and canceled via cash on balance sheet and the Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan with the funds available under tranche C under
the Notes (“Tranche C”) for an aggregate amount of approximately €68.1 million and certain available cash at the Target Group, as
further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The Refinancing.”
(6) Represents the estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including any underwriting or discount fees and
commissions, financial advisory fees and other transaction costs and professional fees), to be financed with the proceeds from Tranche A
under the Notes. The actual amount of fees and expenses will vary from the estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
differences in the amount of fees and expenses actually incurred compared to our estimates.

For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate portions of
the proceeds from the Offering to be used by the Issuer to, consummate the Acquisition and make the Itelyum
Proceeds Loan for purposes of, inter alia, the Refinancing, and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (ISINs
or Common Codes) for each such virtual tranche under the Notes. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and
“Description of Notes.”

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets and the
capitalization as of June 30, 2021 of (i) the Target on an historical consolidated basis as derived from the
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and (ii) the Issuer on a consolidated basis as adjusted to give pro
_forma effect to the Transactions, as if they had occurred on June 30, 2021. Unless otherwise noted, the “As_
Adjusted” column does not give effect to movements in cash and cash equivalents or amounts borrowed or
repaid after June 30, 2021. We have prepared the information presented in the “As Adjusted” column for
illustrative purposes only. Such information is hypothetical and based on pro forma adjustments and
assumptions related to the Transactions and, therefore, does not represent our actual financial position or
results. Consequently, such information may not be indicative of our total capitalization as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, any other prior date, the Completion Date or any date thereafter. Investors are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on this hypothetical information. The table below should be read in
conjunction with the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Historical
_Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes” and with the_
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes therein.

(1) The as adjusted cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets figure reflects cash, cash equivalents and other current financial
assets of the Issuer as of June 30, 2021 after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, as described under “Summary—The
_Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds,” as if the Transactions had occurred on June 30, 2021. As adjusted cash, cash equivalents and other_
current financial assets excludes the partial payment of the purchase price of €13.6 million in respect of the acquisition of equity interests
in Castiglia paid on July 2, 2021 and the estimated amount of cash and cash equivalents of €5.9 million held by Castiglia as of June 30,
2021. See “Summary–Recent Developments–Acquisition of Castiglia.” Taking into consideration these two items, our estimated as
adjusted cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets would be €30.7 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and other current
financial assets as of the estimated Completion Date could materially deviate from our estimates due to a number of factors, including the
actual timing of the Completion Date and the amount of cash generated and/or otherwise utilized by the Itelyum Group between June 30,
2021 and the Completion Date.
(2) Total financial debt is calculated gross of amortized financing fees, equal to €2.7 million as of June 30, 2021. As Adjusted total financial
debt does not include the estimated amount of €6.9 million of indebtedness we acquired as a result of the acquisition of Castiglia,
consisting of short and medium term bank debt (€3.6 million) and leasing facilities (€3.3 million). Taking into consideration this item,
our estimated as adjusted total financial debt would be €472.1 million.
(3) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby, before the deduction of deferred debt issuance costs.
(4) On or prior to the Issue Date, we expect that the Issuer will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will provide for
the €50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. We do not expect any amounts to be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue
Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”
(5) Actual other debt as of June 30, 2021 consists of non-current financial liabilities (€130.1 million), other non-current financial liabilities
(€29.7 million), current financial liabilities (€43.7 million) and other current financial liabilities (€1.5 million). In particular, it reflects the
amounts outstanding under the Itelyum Regeneration Senior Facility Agreement for an amount of €89.1 million, the Itelyum Purification
Senior Facility Agreement for an amount of €61.7 million, the 2016 Vendor Loan Agreement for an amount of €24.2 million, the 2016
Vendor Loan Agreement for an amount of €6.6 million, as well as other short and medium term recourse factoring and working capital
facilities. As adjusted other debt mainly reflects other financial debt which we expect will remain outstanding following the Completion
Date, including leasing liabilities for an amount of €1.5 million. A portion of the proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay and
cancel all liabilities under the Itelyum Regeneration Senior Facilities Agreement, the Itelyum Purification Senior Facilities Agreement
and the Vendor Loan Agreements. As adjusted other debt excludes (i) liabilities under recourse factoring for an amount of €11.6 million,
(ii) approximately €8.0 million we expect to budget as provision for environmental liabilities on our balance sheet as a result of the Lauro
Settlement Agreement, (iii) €12.1 million of deferred purchase consideration for acquisitions previously completed, of which
€5.8 million relates to the acquisition of Castiglia, acquired on July 2, 2021, and is expected to be paid in January 2023, and (iv) the
estimated amount of €6.9 million of indebtedness we acquired as a result of the acquisition of Castiglia, primarily consisting of short and
medium term bank and leasing facilities, all of which we expect to remain outstanding following the Transactions. See “Summary—
_Recent Developments—Settlement Agreements Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities” and “Summary—Recent Developments—_
_Acquisition of Castiglia.”_

(6) As adjusted total equity reflects the expected amount of the Equity Contribution in connection with the Transactions. Excludes the effect
of estimated fees and expenses related to the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”
(7) Total capitalization is defined as total financial debt plus total equity.

**Overview**

We are a leading European circular economy player specialized in the collection, management and recycling of
complex streams of waste, with a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities of industrial
hazardous waste. Leveraging upon our distinctive chemical and recycling competences across our business units,
we provide circular economy solutions to a wide and diversified client base across a variety of industries,
including the automotive and pharmaceutical industries. Our mission is to act as a one-stop shop across all value
chain steps for the industrial waste streams, with particular focus on recycling and regeneration activities.

Our services include the collection of waste, preliminary sorting and storage of waste, second level treatment of
wastewater and oil emulsions, the preparation of waste for energy recovery or any other final destination plant
through specific and specialized chemical treatments, waste oil re-refining (or regeneration) and waste solvent
purification. Our products include lubricant-based oils, bitumen additives and gas oil, as well as a wide range of
complex recovered waste-based thinners, solvent from waste and pure solvents. We also provide environmental
consulting and chemical analysis services in respect of different types of matrices (e.g., water, soil and air)
through our in-house network of accredited laboratories, and offer complimentary services of commercial
brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste and solvents.

We are the leader in the Italian oil regeneration industry, with an approximately 89% market share as of
December 31, 2019, and one of the market leaders in Europe by oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market
share (measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output as of December 31, 2019). We are also the leader
in the Italian waste solvent purification industry, with a 50% market share by revenue and an approximately 37%
market share by production capacity as of December 31, 2019, and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe, with
a 34% market share as of December 2019. In addition, we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of
hazardous waste in Italy in 2019 through our Environment business unit.

The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits
from higher barriers to entry compared to the industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste markets due to
strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical skills required for the waste management processes.
Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has demonstrated a high level of
profitability and resiliency, including during periods of economic difficulties, recording a CAGR of
approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014 compared to a negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP
over the same period.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA of €406.1 million, €85.0 million and €92.0 million, respectively.

We have a large, diversified and established customer base comprising approximately 30,000 customers, ranging
from large corporates to family-owned SMEs. We have long-standing relationships with the large majority of our
top 20 customers, in certain cases spanning over a decade. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top
20 customers (excluding CONOU) accounted for 23.6% of our revenue. Our customers include oil companies
and blenders, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, including blue chip brands such as Eni, Total, Petronas,

97


-----

Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi. While all of our operating sites are located in Italy, we benefit from a global
commercial reach, serving over 60 countries through a network of local distributors. We have a strong
geographical footprint in Italy, especially in its Northern regions. We currently operate 12 waste storage sites and
13 waste treatment and recycling facilities, including four plants for industrial wastewater treatment, two plants
for lubricant oil regeneration, two plants for purification and blending of solvents and five treatment and
pre-treatment plants. We have approximately 800 full-time employees (accounting for the acquisition of Castiglia
in July 2021).

We offer our products and services through three business units:

 - **Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a comprehensive**
range of environmental services, mostly in hazardous waste management and, to a lesser extent, in
non-hazardous waste management covering a broad spectrum of the value chain, with an emphasis on
recycling and recovery activities. Our Environment portfolio includes sustainable services and solutions for
the industrial waste market such as (i) collection, transportation, first level treatment and storage,
(ii) consulting services and laboratory analysis carried out through our network of ten accredited
laboratories, (iii) industrial wastewater treatment and (iv) solid waste treatment. In addition, we offer
complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste.
Our exposure to third-party-operated landfills and incinerators is limited, accounting for approximately 12%
of the total volume of our end-of-waste destinations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Environment business
unit were €143.5 million and €29.6 million, respectively, representing 35.3% and 34.8%, respectively, of
our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

 - **Regeneration. Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the production**
of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process that transforms waste oil, a hazardous
waste, into a valuable product. Our used oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano primarily
produce regenerated lubricant bases and, to a lesser extent, diesel oil and other by-products. We believe that
the high quality and price competitiveness of our regenerated lubricant bases (comparable to virgin oils),
underpinned by our proprietary re-refining technology enabling the Group to process a wide spectrum of
feedstock qualities, represents a strong competitive advantage over many of our competitors. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Regeneration business unit
were €117.8 million and €34.5 million, respectively, representing 29.0% and 40.6%, respectively, of our
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

 - **Purification. Our Purification business unit comprises the production and sale of a variety of solvents**
derived both from the valorization of chemical waste, including thinners and solvents from waste (“SFW”),
and virgin raw materials, including pure aliphatics. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Purification business unit were €144.8 million and €20.9 million,
respectively, representing 35.7% and 24.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

The following charts set forth our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA breakdown by business unit for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021.

We believe that the breadth of the services we offer and products we produce through our business units has
enabled us to build a significant competitive advantage within the Italian waste management market, establishing
our position as a leading one-stop shop service provider of circular economy solutions for a wide range of
customers across various industries. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we directly managed
approximately 837 thousand tons of waste materials, primarily consisting of lubricant oil, solvents, industrial
hazardous water, waste treatment for energy valorization and other waste (excluding intermediated waste), with
hazardous and non-hazardous waste accounting for 71% and 29%, respectively, of these volumes, and solid and
liquid waste accounting for 19% and 81%, respectively, of these volumes. For the same period, we managed and
processed approximately 1,174 thousand tons of waste (including intermediated waste). The following charts set
forth the breakdown of waste volumes treated by us for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

Our results of operations are affected by a combination of factors, including factors which are beyond our
control. We believe that our results of operations, and particularly the results of operations during the periods
under review, have been primarily affected by the following factors.

**_Economic conditions and impact of COVID-19_**

Periods of high economic growth and industrial activity have typically led to increased waste volumes in our
business, as well as higher demand for our products. Conversely, in periods of weak growth or recession,
volumes tend to decrease due to lower economic activity, which decreases the waste volumes that we collect. As
78.8% of our revenue was generated in Italy for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and almost all the waste
we collect and treat derives from Italy, our results of operations are particularly dependent on the general
economic conditions and developments in Italy. A downturn in the Italian economy can affect our customers’
spending generally, demand and pricing for our products and services, the creditworthiness of our customers, and
the availability and cost of our debt financings.

Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian economy contracted sharply in the first quarter of
2020, recording a year-on-year contraction in GDP of 5.1% and entering a new recession, followed by a 11.8%
year-on-year decrease in the second quarter of 2020, which was the worst year-on-year decrease of GDP since
records began in 1995 (source: ISTAT) as the country was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially
_affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.” As a result of the restrictive measures_
introduced by the Italian government, such as social distancing measures, the nationwide lockdowns of most
business activities in the first half of 2020, we transitioned a portion of our workforce to remote working and
experienced operational difficulties; in particular, our plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano were closed for
several weeks between April and June 2020. Several restrictive measures have continued to be in place in Italy
during 2020 and in the first half of 2021. These difficulties have created a context of uncertainty that has
impacted our results in 2020, including in terms of revenues and margins. Our Regeneration business was
particularly impacted by the decline in collected used oil and production slowdown in the first half of 2020,
resulting in a decrease in our production volumes of base oil of approximately 17% for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Revenue and EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 from our Regeneration
activities decreased by 12.8% and 33.2%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

In 2021, general economic conditions began to improve as a result of proactive measures to control the spread of
the infection and the rollout of vaccines, although a new wave of infections driven by the outbreak of the “Delta”
variant has hit several countries, including Italy. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, as a result of
recovering economic conditions in Italy, our Regeneration business unit registered a significant increase,
processing 89.1 thousand tons of waste oil compared to 53.0 thousand tons processed during the same period of
2020 (an increase of 68.1%) and recording sales of 62.7 thousand tons of base oil compared to 42.6 thousand
tons during the same period of 2020 (an increase of 47.2%).

The results recorded by our Regeneration business unit for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 showed a
favorable trend when compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019, which were not impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we processed 184.4 thousand tons of
waste oil and sold 122.4 thousand tons of base oil through our Regeneration business unit compared to 181.0 and
122.1 thousand tons, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019 (an increase of 1.9% and 0.2%,
respectively).

As there can be no assurance as to how long certain temporary closures and restrictions may remain in effect or
when new restrictions may be re-implemented, we are currently unable to estimate the magnitude of the impact
of COVID-19 on our business, and the results of operations and cash flows for future periods may not be
comparable.

**_Acquisitions_**

Our operating results and their comparability for the periods under review were impacted by the effects of a
number of bolt-on acquisitions. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to
revenues, EBITDA, margins, cash flow, cost and revenue synergies and return on investment targets before we
proceed with the acquisition. Between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021, we acquired controlling stakes in or
the entire share capital of ten companies (excluding the transactions where we only increased our stake in
previously acquired companies and companies that were already controlled by the acquired companies). In
particular, we made five acquisitions in 2018 and five acquisitions in 2020. The acquisition of the remaining
minority stakes in the acquired companies for which we are currently holding controlling interests is subject to
call and put options. See “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on
_acquisitions.”_

We believe that the acquisitions we made in the period under review have generated synergies for our business
and have contributed to our organic growth. Such acquisitions have given us, for example, the ability to enrich
our product portfolio and service offering, and expand our customer base and geographic reach. Historically, we
have funded our bolt-on acquisitions primarily with cash from operations, as well as third-party debt. For a
description of the most significant acquisitions we carried out in the periods under review, see “—Factors
_Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on acquisitions.”_

**_Volume of waste serviced_**

Our results of operations are affected by the volume and the types of waste that we collect and process as our
contractual arrangements with customers generally compensate us according to volume, usually at a set price per
unit. Given the largely fixed cost nature of our business and the high processing capacity of our waste
management sites, higher volumes generally allow us to keep a site at an optimal utilization, thereby utilizing our
machinery and personnel more efficiently and therefore reducing the impact of our fixed cost base. Moreover,

100


-----

waste volumes affect our logistics costs, as an increase in collected waste typically results in higher
transportation costs. The table below sets forth the components of our income statement that are mostly affected
by volume of serviced waste (i.e., revenue and purchase, services and other charges) for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021.

treatment fee for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30,
2021, respectively.

During the periods presented, our volume of waste received was affected by, in addition to general economic
conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, acquisitions of other businesses as well as by organic
growth. See “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on acquisitions.” We
also believe that the broad scope of our waste management operations provides our business model with
resilience by reducing our exposure to fluctuations in waste collection volumes and generating more regular
waste flows. We believe that the size and density of our network in Northern Italy, our large and diversified
customer base and our presence across the entire waste services value chain constitute key competitive
advantages that enable us effectively manage our costs and increase the efficiency of our operations.

**_CONOU incentive mechanisms_**

Our results of operations, particularly relating to our Regeneration business, are affected by the incentive
mechanisms established by CONOU (Consorzio nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e trattamento degli oli
_minerali usati). Pursuant to the enactment of Italian Legislative Decree no. 152 of April 3, 2006 (the_
“Environmental Code”), CONOU has set up an incentive mechanism paid to oil regeneration companies, the
CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lube oil (i.e., the fee
increases upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), thus ensuring that we and other players in the
oil regeneration industry are granted certain downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lube oil
prices. In accordance with the Italian Environmental Code, lube oil producers fund the oil regeneration value
chain by paying to CONOU an amount determined as set forth by applicable law and regulatory framework,
which was equal to approximately €0.09 on average over the period 2011-2020 for each litre of lubricant oil sold.
CONOU distributes the amounts so collected via, inter alia, the regeneration treatment fee. The CONOU
regeneration treatment fee is paid to oil regeneration companies on a monthly basis based on the volumes of
regenerated oil bases produced and is calculated based on the ICIS average price of lube oil recorded during the
preceding quarter. The time lag associated with the calculation of the CONOU regeneration treatment fee,
together with the increase recorded by oil prices in the first half of 2021 and the increase in volume of oil bases
produced, has favorable impacted our margin for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2020, which was also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these factors, the
CONOU regeneration treatment fee we collected for the six months ended June 30, 2021 amounted to
€17.3 million, an increase of €7.8 million, or 82.1%, over the amount of €9.5 million collected for the six months
ended June 30, 2020. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee sustains the circularity in all the phases of the
waste oil economic cycle, is based on the principle of the Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) and permits
us to significantly offset the cyclical decrease in oil price by guaranteeing a minimum profitability threshold in
the sale of our oil-based products. See “Business—CONOU Incentive Mechanisms.” Revenue from our
Regeneration business unit accounted for 29.0% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. The
table below sets out the amount of CONOU regeneration treatment fee, including as a percentage of revenue
generated by our Regeneration business unit, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the
six months ended June 30, 2021.

CONOU has recently amended the formula for determining the regeneration treatment fee. Under the current
framework, which came into force in October 2020, the regeneration treatment fee is no longer subject to a set
cap that was historically set at €329 per ton of regeneration oil and limited the amount of compensation granted
to oil regeneration companies during periods of fluctuations in oil prices. We estimate that the removal of the set
cap as well as other amendments to the formula, on a pro forma basis for the year 2020 as if the new formula had
been in place as of January 1, 2020, would have had an estimated positive impact of €2.2 million, €2.1 million,
€1.9 million and €1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021, respectively. We expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after
December 2024, except in exceptional circumstances indicated in CONOU regulation which, in any event cannot
be retroactive. Any significant amendment to the formula and the current framework for incentive mechanics
established by CONOU may have a material impact on the profitability of our Regeneration business unit. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our Regeneration business relies on the incentives mechanisms
_provided by CONOU and its supply of waste oil.”_

**_Regulatory, environmental and safety matters_**

Our results of operations are affected by environmental and sustainability laws, regulations and our customers’
environmental requirements and awareness. The main regulations affecting our business are the waste
management regulatory framework in the European Union, currently governed by the directive 2008/98/EC, as
recently amended by directive 2018/851/EU, and the REACH regulation, which imposes significant obligations
on the chemicals industry with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of substances. We
are also subject to the EU ETS System governing GHG emissions and the Environmental Code which governs,
_inter alia, the management of waste in Italy and the granting of the permits for the opening and management of_
waste management plants. See “Regulation.”

In addition, from time to time, we may incur remediation costs at our current facilities and as of June 30, 2021,
we had made provisions of €6.4 million for potential environmental liabilities and ecological clean-ups that may
be necessary at certain of our facilities. If environmental harm is found to have occurred as a result of our current
or historical operations, we may incur significant remediation costs and pay fines and damages. Our
environmental compliance and remediation costs could therefore increase. Our provisions for environmental
liabilities are expected to increase as a result of our entry into of the Lauro Settlement Agreement, pursuant to
which we undertook to bear the costs of certain environmental remediation activities relating to the Landriano
purification site, estimated to be approximately €8.0 million as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Such
amount is expected to be budgeted as provision for environmental liabilities on our balance sheet. We expect to
incur these costs over the period 2021-2030. For further details, see “Summary—Recent Developments—
_Settlement Agreements Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our_
_Business—Our operations are subject to an increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations,_
_especially in regards to the environment,” “—Maintaining compliance with the chemical safety regulations_
_applicable to both our products and raw materials could adversely affect our business,” and “—We may face_
_liabilities in connection with environmental matters.”_

**_Fluctuations in prices of raw materials and commodities_**

Our results of operations partially depend on the price at which we are able to obtain our principal raw material
inputs and sell our products. The prices of raw materials we use in, or produced through, our waste management
solutions, such as base oil or aliphatics, fluctuate according to global economic supply and demand, especially
levels of economic growth. For example, the selling prices of aliphatics, which are produced through our
Purification activities, are based on the market price of virgin naphtha, which decreased by 22.7% over the period
2018-2020. Conversely, when prices of our raw materials increase, we attempt to mitigate the negative effect on
our margins by seeking to pass through raw material cost increases to our customers through higher prices for our
products, although we sometimes experience a limited time lag in our ability to do so in relation to our mid-term
contracts, which represent approximately half of our contracts and have a typical duration of two to three years.

-----

In addition, our business is also exposed to fluctuations in costs related to certain commodities, such as methane,
fuel and electricity, that are widely used in our business for logistic and production purposes. Prices for oil and
electricity are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control, including
geopolitical developments, supply and demand, change in applicable laws and regulations, adverse weather and
regional production patterns.

**_Seasonality_**

We experience a limited degree of seasonal fluctuations in the demand for certain of our products and services,
particularly in respect of our Environment solutions which recorded a phasing imbalance in favour of the second
half of the year for the period 2018-2020 (on average, 53.0% of revenue is recorded in the second half of each
year), mainly due to the seasonality of our Environment trading activities. This trend has grown in recent year
due to greater weight assumed by our Environment trading activities over the same period. Despite this limited
seasonal effect, we believe our overall results are relatively stable as a result of the diversification of our product
portfolio and breadth of our service offering.

**_Fluctuations in currency exchange rates_**

The euro is the functional currency of our Consolidated Financial Statements and all subsidiaries of our Group
report results in euro. However, we carry out operations in currencies other than the euro, principally in U.S.
dollars, and our results of operations are therefore impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. Our primary
exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is for the purchases of certain raw materials and sales of certain of our
products in U.S. dollars, which results, to a certain extent, in a natural hedging (whereby the effects of revenues
and costs in U.S. dollars partially offset each other). Foreign exchange exposure has typically been relevant to
our Purification business unit, which recorded 13.8% of its revenue in U.S. dollars for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2021, corresponding to 5.0% of our revenue for the period. Foreign currency transactions are accounted
for at the euro-equivalent amount based on the exchange rate set on the transaction date, while the exchange
differences realized at the date of collection or payment are recorded in the income statement as foreign
exchange gains or losses.

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations**

**_Bolt-on acquisitions_**

We have historically expanded our operations through small and medium-size bolt-on acquisitions, thereby
expanding our geographical reach as well as the volumes and the type of waste we collect and process. Many of
the acquisitions we have completed in recent years were aimed at consolidating our market position, enhancing
our product offering and driving operational efficiencies. Our results of operations during the periods under
review have been affected by such acquisitions, which may make it more difficult to evaluate the historical
performance of our business by comparing period over period results. The most significant bolt-on acquisitions
we carried out in the period between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021 are described below.

_Centro Risorse, Area S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l., Keoma S.r.l, Ecoausilia S.r.l. and Ecoserve S.r.l. In April_
2018, we acquired 70% of the equity interests in Centro Risorse S.r.l., Area S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l.,
Keoma S.r.l and Ecoausilia S.r.l., for an aggregated acquisition consideration of €12.0 million including deferred
payments, price adjustments and earn-outs. The acquisition of the remaining 30% of the equity interest in Centro
Risorse S.r.l., Area S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l. and Keoma S.r.l. is subject to put and call options. These
companies are specialized in the management and valorization of industrial waste, wastewater treatment,
chemical analysis, transport and environment and safety consultancy services. All of the equity interests in
Ecoausilia S.r.l. and Ecoserve S.r.l. was subsequently acquired in 2020 and these companies were merged into
our subsidiary Neda Ambiente FVG S.r.l.

_Carbo-Nafta Ecologia. In January 2020, we acquired a 80% stake in Carbo Nafta Ecologia S.r.l. for €2.7 million,_
including price adjustment and deferred payments; a potential earn-out could be payable in April 2022 for a
maximum amount of €0.6 million. The acquisition of the remaining 20% of the equity interest in Carbo Nafta
Ecologia S.r.l. is subject to put and call options. Carbo Nafta Ecologia S.r.l. operates in the collection and
management of industrial waste. This acquisition enabled us to strengthen our competitive position in Central
Italy, in particular in the regions of Umbria, Lazio and Tuscany.

_Idroclean. In February 2020, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Idroclean S.r.l., which in turn held the_
entire equity interests in its subsidiaries Agrid S.r.l. and Labio.Lab S.r.l. as well as a 30% stake in ASMia, for

103


-----

€19.8 million, including price adjustment and deferred payments. The Idroclean group primarily operates in
Lombardy and Northern Italy and it is specialized in the treatment and purification of industrial water mainly for
pharmaceutical and chemical companies. Although we own only 30% of the share capital in ASMia, as of
June 30, 2021, we consolidate 68% of the income statement of ASMia into our consolidated income statement, as
we have contractual arrangements with the other shareholders of ASMia pursuant to which we are deemed to
control ASMia for purposes of the consolidation principles under Italian GAAP. The balance sheet of ASMia is
otherwise consolidated in our balance sheet for 30%, which is in line with our ownership percentage.

_Intereco. In July 2020, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Intereco S.r.l., for €12.1 million, including_
price adjustment and deferred payments; a potential earn-out payment could be due by the end of 2021 for a
maximum amount of €0.6 million. Intereco S.r.l. is a company specialized in recycling and valorization solutions
for hazardous and non-hazardous special waste. This acquisition enabled us to strengthen our position in
Northern and Central Italy thanks to Intereco S.r.l.’s strong client base across the industrial district in EmiliaRomagna, with a focus on ceramic tiles.

_Ferolmet. In October 2020, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Ferolmet S.r.l., which in turn holds 86%_
of the equity interest in Riraee S.r.l., for €9.2 million, including a price adjustment already paid and deferred
payments; a potential earn-out payment could be due in April 2022 and April 2023 for a maximum aggregated
amount of €1.9 million. Ferolmet S.r.l. is a company based near Milan, and operates primarily in the Northern
part of Italy, which is specialized in storage and preparation activities for recycling and valorization solutions for
hazardous and non-hazardous special waste.

All acquired companies (except for ASMia, which operates under its own brand) have been integrated within the
Itelyum Group and are operating under the Itelyum brand. We intend to continue our selective external growth
strategy by acquiring small to medium-sized regional and national businesses in Italy as well as, potentially,
neighboring countries that are complementary to our service and product offerings and offer synergies and ease
of integration.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which an
acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired businesses in our consolidated
results. As the acquired businesses are included in our consolidation perimeter from the date of completion of the
relevant acquisition, their full impact is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period.
Following an acquisition, we seek to integrate the companies into our structure. For example, we typically
coordinate administration, finance and treasury, IT, human resources and other support functions with our central
management functions, and seek to leverage our national network and commercial structure in order to increase
the waste volumes processed at the sites that are acquired. We also generally keep and strengthen local
management teams, which we believe increases the chance of a smooth integration of the acquired company.

On July 2, 2021, we acquired 70% of the equity interests in Castiglia, a company providing integrated services
for environmental protection and sustainability with a particular focus on the management of waste deriving from
water purification processes. The acquisition of the remaining 30% of the equity interest in Castiglia is subject to
call and put options. Through the acquisition of Castiglia, we expect to enhance our market position in the
Southern regions of Italy. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.”

€223.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, driven primarily by organic growth across all our
business units and inorganic growth of €15.4 million resulting from the acquisitions completed in the second half
of 2020.

Our revenue by business unit for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 was as follows:

Environment revenue increased by €23.3 million, or 46.0%, from €50.6 million for the six months ended June 30,
2020 to €73.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, mainly as a result of the inorganic growth of
€15.4 million resulting from the acquisitions completed relating to our Environment business unit in the second
half of 2020.

Regeneration revenue increased by €32.4 million, or 96.4%, from €33.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 to €66.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, mainly as a result of higher volumes of
oil processed and sold and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit sales prices of regenerated oil driven by the
significant increase in activity level recorded in the first half of 2021 compared to the corresponding period of
2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume of used oil processed increased by
67.9%, from 53 thousand tons for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 89 thousand tons for the six months
ended June 30, 2021. CONOU regeneration treatment fee we collected for the six months ended June 30, 2021

106


-----

amounted to €17.3 million, an increase of €7.8 million, or 82.1%, over the amount of €9.5 million collected for
the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to the ICIS prices of lube oil recorded over the periods and the
time lag associated with the calculation of the CONOU regeneration treatment fee, as described under “—Key
_Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—CONOU incentive mechanisms” above._

Purification revenue increased by €19.5 million, or 30.7%, from €63.6 million for the six months ended June 30,
2020 to €83.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, mainly as a result of due to higher volumes of
waste processed and products sold and, to a lesser extent, an increase in unit sales prices of our Purification
products, in particular relating to our pure solvents.

_Other income_

Other income increased by €1.1 million, from €0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to
€1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_Change in work in progress, semi-finished and finished product inventories_

Change in work in progress, semi-finished and finished product inventories was represented by a decrease of
€3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to an increase of €1.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2021, primarily due to significant reduction in semi-finished and finished products recorded in our
Regeneration business unit in the six months ended June 30, 2020.

_Purchase, services and other charges_

Purchase, services and other charges increased by €39.6 million, or 36.9%, from €107.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2020 to €146.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to the
increase in purchase of raw materials used in the production process and costs relating to services of an
operational nature required to support the increase in revenue. As a percentage of revenue, purchase, services and
other charges decreased from 72.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 65.9% for the six months ended
June 30, 2021, primarily due to improved margin recorded, in particular by our Regeneration and Purification
business units.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €3.9 million, or 20.4%, from €19.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020
to €23.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to the increase in personnel resulting from
the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2020. As a percentage of revenue, personnel costs decreased
from 12.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 10.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily
due to the increase in revenue over the period, which more than offset the increase in personnel costs.

_Other operating costs_

Other operating costs decreased by €0.7 million, or 12.3%, from €5.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 to €5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. As a percentage of revenue, other
operating costs decreased from 3.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to 2.2% for the six months ended
June 30, 2021, primarily due to the increase in revenue.

_Provisions for risks and charges_

Provisions for risks and charges decreased by €1.7 million, or 85.0%, from €2.0 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 to €0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased by €15.2 million, or 72.7%, from €20.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 to €36.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to the amortization of
goodwill over the period driven by the revaluation of goodwill carried out in the second half of 2020.

-----

_Impairment of receivables_

Impairment of receivables increased by €0.7 million, from €0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to
€0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to updated estimates on the recoverability of
receivables conducted following the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Operating result_

Operating result increased by €20.9 million from negative €6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to
€14.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to the significant increase in revenue and
tight control over our costs.

_Financial expenses_

Financial expenses were substantially stable, recording a slight increase of €0.3 million, from €5.2 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2020 to €5.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_Profit before taxation_

Profit before taxation increased by €20.7 million, from a loss of €11.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2020 to a profit of €9.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to the reasons
discussed above.

_Income taxes_

Income taxes increased by €5.0 million, or 238.1%, from €2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 to
€7.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to the increase in taxable income.

_Profit for the period_

For the six months ended June 30, 2020 we recorded a loss of €13.6 million, while for the six months ended
June 30, 2021 we recorded a profit of €2.1 million. Such positive trend was due to the reasons discussed above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our
existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and any borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain various conditions that must be satisfied in
order for the lenders thereunder to make loans available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Cash flows from our
financing activities have in the past included, among others, bank facilities and shareholder debt. Historically,
our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect that our principal uses of cash following the consummation
of the Transactions will be, to fund capital expenditure, provide working capital, meet debt service requirements
and fund potential future acquisitions from time to time.

We believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility will be
sufficient to meet our requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future. However, following the
Transactions, we will have significant debt service obligations. Our actual financing requirements will depend on
a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure
_and the Financing—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and_
_prior to the Post Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the operating companies of the Target_
_Group to be able to make payments on the Notes.”_

Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented.

Net working capital decreased by €17.0 million from €25.7 million as of December 31, 2018 to €8.7 million as of
December 31, 2019, mainly due to reduction in trade payables and greater efficiency in the collection of recourse
and non-recourse receivables.

Net working capital decreased by €4.8 million from €8.7 million as of December 31, 2019 to €3.9 million as of
December 31, 2020, mainly due to greater efficiency in the collection of recourse and non-recourse receivables
and the variation in the perimeter resulting from the acquisitions completed during 2020.

Net working capital increased by €14.3 million from €3.9 million as of December 31, 2020 to €18.2 million as of
June 30, 2021, mainly due to price and volume increases on sales and purchases.

**_Capital expenditure_**

Capital expenditure consists of the sum of additions in property, plant and equipment and additions in intangible
assets. Our capital expenditure incurred in the periods under review is set out below:

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our capital expenditure was €14.6 million, an increase of €3.5 million
from €11.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to investments made to
increase production capacity.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our capital expenditure was €18.1 million, an increase of €3.5 million
from €14.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase reflected investment for extraordinary
equipment and plant replacements, acquisition of land for new industrial developments and investments made to
increase production capacity.

-----

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, our capital expenditure was €9.9 million, an increase of €3.7 million
from €6.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. This increase reflected investment for extraordinary
equipment and plant replacements and investments made to increase production capacity.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect our capital expenditure for 2021 to be significantly
higher than our capital expenditure for 2020, mainly driven by expected investments relating to capacity
expansion projects, including in respect of waste storage, treatment and tank capacity, and investments to support
organic growth. Our capital expenditure for 2022 is expected to be in line with our capital expenditure for 2020.
We aim to maximize our plant capacity by pursuing continuous technological improvements, upgrades to our
production equipment and investments in R&D projects. Furthermore, we expect to expand the revenue
generating capacity of our Purification business unit by investing in special projects, primarily aimed at
expanding capacity at our purification and blending plants and adding new product lines to our portfolio.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of June 30, 2021, we had guaranties and sureties granted by the Itelyum Group to guarantee the fulfilment of
non-financial obligations by third parties, including other companies and public entities, in the amount of
€32.2 million. Guarantees are typically granted in favour of public bodies which issue and control the integrated
environmental authorizations relating to our sites. For more information, please refer to Note 37 to our Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

Our activities and debt financing expose us to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are
interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Our overall risk management strategy seeks to
minimize the potential adverse effects of such risks.

**_Credit risk_**

Our credit risk represents our exposure to potential losses due to counterparties’ inability to discharge the
obligations undertaken. This exposure relates almost exclusively to trade receivables deriving from the sale of
products and services. Our credit collection performance has historically been successful and losses incurred in
the past have been relatively modest. As of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and June 30, 2021, our bad debt
provision was €1.2 million (or 0.4% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018), €1.6 million (or
0.5% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019), €2.0 million (or 0.6% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020), €2.7 million (or 0.5% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021),
respectively.

**_Currency risk_**

The euro is the functional currency used for our consolidated financial statements; however, we carry out
operations in currencies other than the euro, principally in U.S. dollars; thus, we are exposed to currency risk.
Our risk management policy seeks to reduce the impact on our Group’s margins and cash flows from currency
movements, minimizing at the same time protection costs against these events. For commercial or financial
transactions in currencies other than the euro, the currency risk managed concerns fluctuations in the exchange
rate between the agreement of the commercial/financial operation and its receipt/payment. For further
information, see “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Fluctuations in currency exchange rates.”

116


-----

**_Interest rate risk_**

This risk concerns the possibility that an increase in market rates results in higher interest charges. We typically
seek to mitigate this risk by entering into interest rate swaps. This type of hedge seeks to minimize interest rate
changes generated by loans at variable rates. The exposure to interest rate risk is calculated on the basis of the
loan repayment plans and the parameters used to calculate interest.

As of December 31, 2020, Itelyum Regeneration had in place interest rate swaps for a notional total amount of
€48.5 million maturing on December 31, 2021 and Itelyum Purification had in place interest rate swaps for a
notional total amount of €35.8 million with maturity on December 31, 2022. The agreements are expected to be
terminated in connection with the Transactions. The table below sets forth our interest rate hedges as of
December 31, 2020:

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk we will not have enough financial resources available to meet our financial obligations
and commitments when due. We have put in place certain procedures aimed at optimizing cash flow management
and reducing the liquidity risk, including:

    - the maintenance of an adequate level of available liquidity;

    - the obtainment of adequate borrowing facilities being put in place; and

    - the control of prospective liquidity conditions.

In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which will
provide for a €50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. We do not expect any amounts to be drawn under the
Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates**

The preparation of financial statements requires our management to apply accounting principles and methods
which, in certain circumstances, are based on difficult and subjective estimates and assumptions based on
historical experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable from time to time and realistic according to
the relative circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the
financial statements and other information provided in this Offering Memorandum. These estimates and
assumptions used are based on past experience and other factors considered relevant. However, actual results
could differ from the estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the impacts of any
resulting changes are recognized directly in the income statement in the period in which the estimates are revised,
if the revision impacts only that period, or also in future periods, if the revision impacts both the current and
future periods. The most significant accounts concerned by these uncertainties are: (i) valuation of goodwill;
(ii) evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets;
(iii) depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets;
(iv) environmental liabilities; (v) provision for risks and charges and bad debt provision; and (vi) the inventory
obsolescence provision. In addition, the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum have been impacted by
the revaluation of property, plant and equipment carried out pursuant to Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020.

_Valuation of Goodwill_

Valuation of goodwill involves a complex procedure that requires the application of various valuation methods,
including the identification and measurement of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities taken on,
and is often carried out by independent experts. These methods use the following inputs: historical information,
forecasts based on estimates or on observation of the market e.g. the royalty rate for the use of comparable assets,
the discount rate, the residual useful life of the assets acquired, etc.

117


-----

_Evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_

We conduct different impairment tests for each business units. For the year ended December 31, 2020, such
impairment tests were made on the basis of economic and financial projection of our Group for the period
2021-2025. The forecasts are based on the assumptions characterized by intrinsic uncertainty, both with reference
to macroeconomic and sector conditions as well as specific conditions tied to our Itelyum Group, based on the
current status and knowledge of the pandemic crisis at the time the estimate was made.

_Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets_

Depreciation rates of the property, plant and equipment and the amortization rates of goodwill and other
intangible assets are calculated based on the best estimate of the residual useful life of the assets linked to
production carried out the Itelyum Group’s experts and directors.

_Environmental liabilities_

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations on environmental protection at European, national, regional and
local level. The measurement of future liabilities in connection with remediation and restoration obligations in
relation to the sites and/or land on which our Group carries out its business is a complex process based on
technical and financial assumptions made by our management and supported by independent experts, where
necessary. The estimates are reviewed at each balance sheet date to verify that the amounts recorded are the best
reflection of the costs our Group will face. If any significant variations are found, the amounts are adjusted. The
key factors for revising cost estimates are the developments in the technologies and the environmental
regulations.

Measurement of environmental liabilities recorded in the financial statements takes into account the
environmental legislation currently in force. Measurements could be subject to significant variations in relation
to: (i) the possibility of further contamination; (ii) the results of current and future refurbishment and the other
possible effects arising from applicable laws; (iii) the possible effects of new laws and regulations relating
environmental protection; (iv) the effects of any technological innovations for environmental cleansing; and
(v) the possibility of disputes concerning environmental liabilities for specific sites and the difficulty of
determining the potential consequences, including in relation to the liability to other parties and any indemnity.

_Provisions for risks and charges and bad debt provision_

Our financial statements reflects the estimate of liabilities based on the best knowledge of solvency of the
counterparts and the status of litigation, on the basis of the information provided by legal and tax advisors as well
as considering the outstanding contracts with our counterparts. The estimate of these risks is subject to
uncertainties.

_Inventory obsolescence provision_

The inventory obsolescence provision reflects the management’s estimate of our Group’s expected losses in
value, determined on the basis of past experience. Abnormal market price trends could have repercussions in
future inventory write-downs.

_Revaluation pursuant to Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020_

In 2020, we have exercised the option provided under art. 110 of Law Decree 104/2020, converted into Law no.
126 of October 13, 2020, and registered the revaluation of selected property, plant and equipment for a number of
our subsidiaries.

The higher value of property, plant and equipment was determined by comparing the fair value of the assets, as
indicated in the report prepared by a third party expert, with the residual net book value, after the depreciation for
the year 2020. In particular, the fair value of the assets was determined by applying an evaluation process based
on its hypothetical replacement with a new similar asset. Its maximum value has been determined and it is
identifiable with the cost the Itelyum Group would incur to replace it or with its exact replica (“new construction
cost”) or, alternatively, if less, with that of an assets with equivalent characteristics and production capacities
(“replacement cost”).

118


-----

Subsequently, the maximum value of the assets was reduced to take into account the loss of value from the
“physical depreciation” and from the “functional obsolescence” which measure their loss of value with respect to
a new one. On the basis of the expert estimate, our Group has entered higher values in Property, plant and
equipment for €163.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The expert estimate attests that the net book value after
revaluation does not exceed the recoverable amount likely to be attributable in relation to the production capacity
and the possibility of using the relevant property, plant and equipment by the companies and in relation to its
current value. For the purposes of this revaluation we used the accounting technique of increasing the historical
cost (gross amount) up to the level of fair value of the asset and reducing the accumulated depreciation. As a
result of the assessment carried out, we opted for an extension of the period of the original depreciation, resulting
from an assessment of the residual useful life of the assets by management, taking into account the expert
estimate. All the relevant subsidiaries have also opted to the substitute tax, equal to 3% of the revaluation, to
recognize it for tax purposes.

The table below shows the effect of the revaluation on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.

**Overview**

We are a leading European circular economy player specializing in the collection, sorting and recycling complex
streams of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Leveraging upon our distinctive chemical competences across
our integrated business units, we provide circular economy solutions to a wide and diversified customer base
comprising approximately 30,000 customers across a variety of industries, including the construction, automotive
and pharmaceutical industries. We operate across the special and industrial hazardous waste management value
chain (excluding direct management of landfill and incineration and excluding urban waste management). We
have a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities and benefit from strong chemical know-how and
access to treatment and recycling alternatives for complex hazardous waste streams.

We believe that the combination of our business units have enabled us to build a significant competitive
advantage within the Italian waste management market, establishing our position as a leading one-stop shop
service provider of circular economy solutions for a wide range of customers across various industries. For the
twelve month ended June 30, 2021, we directly managed and processed approximately 837 thousand tons of
waste materials (excluding intermediated waste), primarily consisting of lube oil, solvents, industrial hazardous
water, waste treatment for energy valorization and other waste, with hazardous and non-hazardous waste
accounting for 71% and 29%, respectively, of these volumes, and solid and liquid waste accounting for 19% and
81%, respectively, of these volumes.

We offer our services and products through three business units:

    - **_Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a_**
comprehensive range of environmental services in hazardous and non-hazardous waste management
covering a broad spectrum of the value chain.

    - **_Regeneration: Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the_**
production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process. Our used oil
regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano primarily produce regenerated lube bases, diesel oil
and other by-products for applications in bituminous membranes lube bases and, to a lesser extent,
diesel oil and other by-products.

    - **_Purification. Our Purification business unit, with an authorized capacity of 100 thousand tons per year,_**
comprises the production and trading of a variety of solvents derived from the valorization of chemical
waste, including thinners and SFW. In addition, we also produce pure solvent and starting materials for
APIs from virgin raw materials.

As 78.9% of our revenue was generated in Italy for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and almost all the
waste we collect and treat derives from Italy, our results of operations are particularly dependent on the general
economic conditions and developments in Italy. Based on studies conducted by Oxford Economics, Italy’s GDP
is expected to grow from €1.65 trillion in 2020 to an estimated €1.88 trillion in 2024. A detailed breakdown of
Italy’s forecasted GDP growth is set out below:

This projected macroeconomic recovery is expected to translate into higher industrial production in Italy and,
consequently, increased levels of hazardous waste production. Various measures of Italian economic recovery,
such as industrial production, retail sales and car registrations, have bounced back in 2021 to their respective
pre-COVID-19 levels, demonstrating the strong year-on-year recovery of the Italian economy. These measures
have been aided by the deployment of an approximately €190 billion EU recovery fund. A detailed snapshot of
the abovementioned metrics is set out below:

_Source: Oxford Economics – Country Economic Forecast Italy (July 14, 2021). Forecasted GDP based on real year-on-year growth_

On the policy front, the Italian government is increasingly focusing on sustainability, with approximately
€70 billion from the EU recovery fund allocated to the “Green Revolution and Ecological Transition.” Among
various areas of intervention, particular attention is being paid to the enhancement of waste recycling
capabilities, through (i) the injection of new liquidity into the sector, improvement of waste management plants
and systems, and introduction of circular economy programs with specific recycling targets, (ii) the integration of
eco-design, eco-products, “blue economy” and bio-economy into the new national strategy for the circular
economy, expected to be adopted by June 2022, (iii) the development of a national program for waste
management to more effectively analyze national data and achieve sustainability targets, and (iv) the provision of
technical support to regional authorities to optimize the management of green public procurements. We believe
that our diversified core competencies as a leading European circular economy player through our Environment,
Purification and Regeneration business units will enable to us capitalize on this increasing policy focus on
sustainability.

**Hazardous Waste Management Market**

_Overview_

Hazardous waste management in Italy is regulated by precise norms, with authorizations granted to manage
specific waste types, classified by specific waste characterization codes defined at the European level. Our
addressable market in Italy consisted of 9.1 million tons of hazardous waste in 2019. In comparison, the urban
waste market in Italy consisted of approximately 30 million tons in 2019 while the non-hazardous waste market
consisted of approximately 131.2 million tons in 2019. We focus on (i) waste management and water treatment,
(ii) solvent, chemical and organic process and (iii) oil waste and other liquid fuel, comprising 31%, 12% and
10%, respectively, of the addressable market in 2019, which have grown at a CAGR of 3.4%, 1.8% and 3.3%,

121


-----

respectively, over a five-year period from 2014 to 2019. A detailed breakdown of the addressable Italian
hazardous waste market, by category and by CAGR from 2014 to 2019, is set out below:

_Source: Market Consultant Analyst_

Moreover, volumes of recycled hazardous waste (our reference market) in Italy have been growing, and are
expected to continue to grow, at a faster pace than the overall market. From 2014 to 2019, recycled hazardous
waste volumes increased at a CAGR of 4.4%, while other hazardous waste volumes decreased at a CAGR of
1.9% over the same period. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted industrial activity in 2020 and 2021,
resulting in an expected 8.6 million tons of Italian hazardous waste in 2021 (down from 9.1 million tons in 2019).
Between 2021 and 2025, while the overall hazardous waste market in Italy is expected to grow broadly in line
with industrial production (at a CAGR of 1.9%), recycled waste volumes are once again expected to outperform
the general market, growing at a CAGR of 2.9% over the same period. Besides a general secular trend towards
recycling, this trend will result from regulatory restrictions on new authorizations for Italian landfills and
incinerators, which are currently operating at almost full capacity, resulting in the price increases described
below and the need for alternatives to landfill disposal and incineration. The evolution of volumes in the Italian
hazardous waste market from 2014 to 2025 is set out below:

_Source: Market Consultant Analyst_

From a pricing perspective, hazardous waste treatment fees in Italy recorded a significant increase at a CAGR of
approximately 10-15% from 2017 to 2019 primarily due to increasing industrial production and “traditional”
end-of-waste destinations, such as incinerators and landfills, reaching close to maximum capacity. In 2019,
hazardous waste treatment fees in Italy for liquid and solid waste ranged from €50-300 per ton and €300-700 per
ton, respectively. In contrast, non-hazardous waste treatment fees in Italy during 2019 for liquid and solid waste
ranged from €40-50 per ton and €150-250 per ton, respectively. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

122


-----

industrial output and the increased capacity of alternative end-of-waste destinations stabilized prices from 2019
to 2020 (with this trend expected to continue in 2021), prices are projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately
4-5% from 2021 to 2025 as a result of (i) increased industrial production as part of a post-COVID-19 recovery,
driving volumes to a level similar to those in 2019, (ii) regulatory restrictions on new authorizations for other
end-of-waste destinations, increasing the supply-demand imbalance, and (iii) increasing export costs. The
evolution of the value of the recycling subsect of the Italian hazardous waste market between 2014 and 2025 is
set out below:

_Source: Market Consultant Analyst_

_Market Share_

We enjoy a strong market position in Italy where, through our Environment business unit, we managed
approximately 4% of the total volume of hazardous waste for the year ended December 31, 2019. This figure is
calculated as the volumes directly managed by our Environment business unit as a percentage of the total volume
in the hazardous waste market (including waste that is not recycled), therefore excluding volumes managed or
processed by our Purification and Regeneration business units. In addition, we are local market leaders in most
regions in which we operate.

_Competitors_

Despite its first signs of consolidation, the Italian waste management market remains highly fragmented. From 2012
to 2018, the number of companies in the Italian waste management space decreased by 4.1%, from 6,139 to 5,890,
with large companies (i.e., companies employing more than 250 persons), growing both in number (from 75 in 2012
to 90 in 2018) and size (from an average annual turnover of €78 million in 2012 to €91 million in 2018). The
graphic below describes the evolution of the Italian waste management market between 2012 and 2018:

**Used Oil Regeneration Market**

_Overview_

The Italian lubricant oil market has the highest level of circularity in Europe, with 99% of collected oil being
regenerated, as opposed to approximately 50% in the rest of Europe. This is driven by a stable self-sustaining
incentive mechanism offsetting oil price fluctuations, regulated by a private Italian consortium promoting and
supporting waste oil collection and regeneration activities (CONOU). A large and growing European lubricant oil
end-market, with an increasing share of regenerated lubricant oil, generates pricing upside. The chart below sets
forth the percentage of collected oil being regenerated on average in the EU and certain key European countries
in 2018.

In 2020, consumption of lubricant oil in Italy amounted to 370 thousand tons, with the industrial sector
accounting for approximately 55% of the overall volume and the remainder coming from automotive
applications. Consumption was stable between 2014 and 2019, growing at a CAGR of 1.2% over this period,
driven by: (i) a new mechanism introduced in the automotive industry that generated increased oil consumption
in the sector at a CAGR of 1.0% between 2014 and 2019, and (ii) a steady increase in industrial production.
While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to an approximately 10% reduction in overall oil consumption
in 2020 (from 410 thousand tons in 2019 to 370 thousand tons in 2020, mainly driven by lower automotive use
during the government-imposed lockdown), a partial recovery is anticipated in 2021, with total consumption
expected to rise to 396 thousand tons.

Lubricant oil consumption is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.2% between 2021 and 2025, mainly driven by the
industrial sector growing at a CAGR of 1.6%, while automotive consumption is expected to remain relatively
stable, impacted by the increasing penetration of electric vehicles. In particular, full-electric vehicles (“BEVs”)
are expected to represent only a limited share of the Italian car park by 2025, consequently limiting their adverse
impact on lubricant oil consumption. As electric vehicle penetration requires significant investment in recharging
infrastructure, a mere 1% of the Italian car park is expected to consist of BEVs by 2025. Moreover, the impact of
BEVs on the lubricant oil market is expected to be limited to engine and transmission applications only, with
junctions, suspensions and other automotive applications still expected to use lubricant oils and greases.

On the other hand, hybrid and plug-in cars (“HEVs”), which continue to use a traditional engine alongside an
electric motor, are not expected to have any significant impact on lubricant oil consumption as they consume

Sertego in Spain and STR Tecoil in Finland.

**Solvent Purification Market**

_Overview_

The Italian solvent purification market shows high circularity, growing waste supply and an increasing incidence
of recycling as an end-of-waste destination, in addition to benefiting from a large and growing global
end-market. The waste purification market is expected to continue growing at a steady pace, driven by:
(i) increasing waste production, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, (ii) the reduction of waste volumes
sent to incineration and (iii) the demand for sustainable waste management solutions enabled by additional
authorizations under approval (estimated to generate approximately 95 kilotons of additional capacity, part of
which is expected to be to our benefit).

In 2019, the Italian solvent and chemical waste market amounted to approximately 375 thousand tons, with waste
to purification accounting for 62% of the overall volume (approximately 230 thousand tons) while the remainder
is treated for energy recovery. The Italian solvent and chemical waste market grew at a CAGR of 3.0% between
2010 and 2019 and was characterized by the increasing incidence of waste to purification volumes (from 60% in
2010 to 62% in 2019) on the back of a general trend favoring circular solutions as well as a clear price advantage
over incineration for waste producers, especially for lower-water concentration solvents generating a higher
yield. The projected growth of the Italian solvent and chemical waste market is underpinned by strong growth
prospects in the underlying markets of industrial production (expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately
3.5% from 2019 to 2025) and particularly, API production (expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to
2025), driven by: (i) projected demographic trends, such as an ageing population and an increasing incidence of
chronic diseases, and (ii) API producers potentially reshoring operations that were previously outsourced to the
Asia-Pacific region on account of regulatory constraints. Volumes of waste solvents that are recycled are
expected to continue to outperform volumes of solvents sent to energy recovery (at a CAGR of 4.6% and 1.6%,

respectively, between 2019 and 2025), sustained by the trends outlined above. The graphics below describe the
evolution of the Italian solvent and chemical waste market in further detail:

_Source: Market Consultant Analyst_

_Competitive Landscape_

We are a leading company in the Italian waste solvent purification space, with a capacity of approximately 100
kilotons per year. Our competitive advantage in the purification space is primarily driven by: (i) clear economies
of scale underpinned by a 2-3x capacity advantage over Italian competitors, and (ii) strong relationships with
pharmaceutical companies both as a supplier of quality pure solvents and as a flexible recycler of their waste
solvents. Furthermore, we have built a strong presence in certain end-markets, including in the waste-based
thinner segments in Africa and the Middle East (with a market share of 38% and 37% by volume, respectively, in
2019) and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe (with a 34% market share by volume, in 2019). The charts

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading European circular economy player specialized in the collection, management and recycling of
complex streams of waste, with a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities of industrial
hazardous waste. Leveraging upon our distinctive chemical and recycling competences across our business units,
we provide circular economy solutions to a wide and diversified client base across a variety of industries,
including the automotive and pharmaceutical industries. Our mission is to act as a one-stop shop across all value
chain steps for the industrial waste streams, with particular focus on recycling and regeneration activities.

Our services include the collection of waste, preliminary sorting and storage of waste, second level treatment of
wastewater and oil emulsions, the preparation of waste for energy recovery or any other final destination plant
through specific and specialized chemical treatments, waste oil re-refining (or regeneration) and waste solvent
purification. Our products include lubricant-based oils, bitumen additives and gas oil, as well as a wide range of
complex recovered waste-based thinners, solvent from waste and pure solvents. We also provide environmental
consulting and chemical analysis services in respect of different types of matrices (e.g., water, soil and air)
through our in-house network of accredited laboratories, and offer complimentary services of commercial
brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste and solvents.

We are the leader in the Italian oil regeneration industry, with an approximately 89% market share as of
December 31, 2019, and one of the market leaders in Europe by oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market
share (measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output as of December 31, 2019). We are also the leader
in the Italian waste solvent purification industry, with a 50% market share by revenue and an approximately 37%
market share by production capacity as of December 31, 2019, and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe, with
a 34% market share as of December 2019. In addition, we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of
hazardous waste in Italy in 2019 through our Environment business unit.

The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits
from higher barriers to entry compared to the industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste markets due to
strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical skills required for the waste management processes.
Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has demonstrated a high level of
profitability and resiliency, including during periods of economic difficulties, recording a CAGR of
approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014 compared to a negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP
over the same period.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA of €406.1 million, €85.0 million and €92.0 million, respectively.

We have a large, diversified and established customer base comprising approximately 30,000 customers, ranging
from large corporates to family-owned SMEs. We have long-standing relationships with the large majority of our
top 20 customers, in certain cases spanning over a decade. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top
20 customers (excluding CONOU) accounted for 23.6% of our revenue. Our customers include oil companies
and blenders, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, including blue chip brands such as Eni, Total, Petronas,
Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi. While all of our operating sites are located in Italy, we benefit from a global
commercial reach, serving over 60 countries through a network of local distributors. We have a strong
geographical footprint in Italy, especially in its Northern regions. We currently operate 12 waste storage sites and
13 waste treatment and recycling facilities, including four plants for industrial wastewater treatment, two plants
for lubricant oil regeneration, two plants for purification and blending of solvents and five treatment and
pre-treatment plants. We have approximately 800 full-time employees (accounting for the acquisition of Castiglia
in July 2021).

We offer our products and services through three business units:

 - **Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a comprehensive**
range of environmental services, mostly in hazardous waste management and, to a lesser extent, in
non-hazardous waste management covering a broad spectrum of the value chain, with an emphasis on
recycling and recovery activities. Our Environment portfolio includes sustainable services and solutions for
the industrial waste market such as (i) collection, transportation, first level treatment and storage,
(ii) consulting services and laboratory analysis carried out through our network of ten accredited
laboratories, (iii) industrial wastewater treatment and (iv) solid waste treatment. In addition, we offer
complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste.

129


-----

Our exposure to third-party-operated landfills and incinerators is limited, accounting for approximately 12%
of the total volume of our end-of-waste destinations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Environment business
unit were €143.5 million and €29.6 million, respectively, representing 35.3% and 34.8%, respectively, of
our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

 - **Regeneration. Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the production**
of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process that transforms waste oil, a hazardous
waste, into a valuable product. Our used oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano primarily
produce regenerated lubricant bases and, to a lesser extent, diesel oil and other by-products. We believe that
the high quality and price competitiveness of our regenerated lubricant bases (comparable to virgin oils),
underpinned by our proprietary re-refining technology enabling the Group to process a wide spectrum of
feedstock qualities, represents a strong competitive advantage over many of our competitors. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Regeneration business unit
were €117.8 million and €34.5 million, respectively, representing 29.0% and 40.6%, respectively, of our
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

 - **Purification. Our Purification business unit comprises the production and sale of a variety of solvents**
derived both from the valorization of chemical waste, including thinners and solvents from waste (“SFW”),
and virgin raw materials, including pure aliphatics. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Purification business unit were €144.8 million and €20.9 million,
respectively, representing 35.7% and 24.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

We believe that the breadth of the services we offer and products we produce through our business units has
enabled us to build a significant competitive advantage within the Italian waste management market, establishing
our position as a leading one-stop shop service provider of circular economy solutions for a wide range of
customers across various industries. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we directly managed
approximately 837 thousand tons of waste materials, primarily consisting of lubricant oil, solvents, industrial
hazardous water, waste treatment for energy valorization and other waste (excluding intermediated waste), with
hazardous and non-hazardous waste accounting for 71% and 29%, respectively, of these volumes, and solid and
liquid waste accounting for 19% and 81%, respectively, of these volumes. For the same period, we managed and
processed approximately 1,174 thousand tons of waste (including intermediated waste). The following charts set
forth the breakdown of waste volumes treated by us for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

We act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps for the industrial waste streams through our proprietary
technologies and a strong network of partners for specific types of waste. We have a distinctive focus on
recycling and regeneration activities that enable us to offer circular solutions underpinned by the use of recycled
products as industrial inputs. Our integrated platform: (i) drives significant commercial synergies across our
business units, particularly in relation to sale channels, distributions and technological solutions; (ii) reinforces
our value proposition to customers by covering a broad spectrum of waste management services; (iii) enables
vertical integration by securing a steady supply of waste; (iv) facilitates centralized procurement efforts and
capital expenditure optimization; (v) reduces transportation costs through fleet and route optimization; and
(vi) drives efficiencies in our operations through the sharing of proprietary technologies and best practices. In
addition, our scale and organizational structure often give us a competitive advantage over smaller players who
may experience difficulties complying with increasingly stringent regulations. This is particularly the case of
regulations imposing strict obligations on waste producers in relation to the waste cycle from collection to
end-of-waste destinations. In these instances, structured players like us are able to provide customers with
enhanced regulatory certainty and reduced compliance risks. The graphic below sets out our positioning across
the waste management value chain for each relevant industry.

-----

We are at the forefront of the circular economy model. The integrated nature of our platform and the circularity
of our business model enable us to provide sustainable solutions across our three business units. Supported by
strong technological and operational competencies, we are able to extract value out of industrial waste for the
production of sustainable products and resources. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 88%,
95% and 95% of the waste we managed in the Environment, Regeneration and Purification business units,
respectively, was transformed into products, returned to the environment as purified water or sent to energy
recovery, resulting in an overall circularity index of approximately 90%. Over this period, (i) within our
Environment business unit, 48% of the waste managed was sent to recovery, 27% of the waste managed
underwent water treatment, 13% of the waste managed underwent oil emulsion treatment and 12% of the waste
managed was sent to other destinations, (ii) within our Regeneration business unit, 66%, 14%, 8% and 7% of
lubricant oils processed were used to produce lubricant bases, bitumen additives, water and gas oil, respectively,
while we outsourced 4% and 1% of lubricant oils processed for disposal and recovery, respectively, and
(iii) within our Purification business unit, 60%, 25% and 10% of industrial streams and virgin raw materials
processed were used to produce SFW, pure solvents from virgin raw materials and purified water, respectively,
while we outsourced 4% and 1% of the materials processed for disposal and recovery, respectively. The
remaining portion of the waste is delivered to third-party landfill sites and incinerators. For the year ended
December 31, 2020, 72% of waste collected was internally treated (including waste oil for our Regeneration
business unit), 13% was internally pre-treated and 16% was collected for sorting and storage. Our Regeneration
business solutions enable us to reduce the impact on the environment compared to primary production, resulting
in a reduction of approximately 90% in the consumption of fossil fuel resources, an approximately 200%
reduction in CO2 emissions, an approximately 400% reduction in emissions of fine dusts and an approximately
500% reduction in the emission of acidifying substances (NOx, SO2 and NH3), in each case as compared to
primary production. Furthermore, our Purification business solutions significantly reduce the impact of solvent
recycling compared to primary production, resulting in an approximately 1,000% reduction in CO2 emissions.

In addition, our integrated platform enables us to benefit from solid and attractive market dynamics, leveraging
upon the ongoing regulatory shift from a “linear economy” in favor of a “circular economy.” We benefit from
favorable regulation within the EU and Italy on waste treatment and used oil regeneration. Further to the
enactment of EU Directive 2008/98/EC (supplemented by EU Directive 2018/850), the EU required member
states to significantly reduce waste disposal in favor of recycling, by establishing a specific waste management
hierarchy. Italy implemented the EU-prescribed waste hierarchy through national legislation and set up a system
of recycling authorizations, imposing stringent restrictions on authorized production capacity for special waste
that has reinforced our market position by creating high entry barriers. In addition, these stringent regulatory
requirements are enablers of our strong market position as waste producers are incentivized to rely on our
advanced recycling and waste management solutions as a way of managing high compliance and regulatory costs
relating to the disposal and treatment of industrial waste, including risks of economic penalties and criminal
sanctions. The graphic below presents our advantageous position across the waste management hierarchy.

132


-----

Furthermore, our Regeneration business benefits from the favorable regulatory framework established in Italy,
one of the most virtuous countries in Europe in terms of collection and regeneration of used oil, where
regenerated lubricant oil accounted for 99% of collected volumes in Italy in 2019, compared to an average of
51% in the EU over the same period. We benefit from incentive mechanisms established by CONOU (Consorzio
_nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e trattamento degli oli minerali usati), a private Italian consortium, to support_
our Regeneration business. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market
price of lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lubricant oil market price and vice versa, although
in no event, such as instances of high lubricant oil market prices, does the incentive mechanism require us to pay
a regeneration treatment fee to CONOU), ensures that we have downside protection against fluctuations of crude
oil and lubricant oil prices and supports a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products,
under normal circumstances. This framework has been in place for over ten years and has also been subject to
modifications favorable for oil regeneration companies over the years to better reflect market dynamics and
support collection and regeneration activities. In particular, based on the latest amendment in October 2020, the
regeneration treatment fee is no longer subject to a set cap that historically limited the amount of compensation
granted to oil regeneration companies during periods of significantly low oil prices, such as in the first halves of
2016 and 2020; therefore supporting a profitability floor even in significantly unfavorable oil price scenarios. We
expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after December 2024, except in exceptional
circumstances indicated in the CONOU Operating Regulation which, in any event, cannot be retroactive. We
estimate that the removal of the set cap as well as other amendments to the formula, on a pro forma basis for the
year 2020, would have had an estimated positive impact of €1.9 million on our EBITDA for the year ended
December 31, 2020.

The quality and breadth of our role as a circular economy player enabled us to achieve a strong market position
in Italy, where we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of hazardous waste through our Environment
business unit for the year ended December 31, 2019. Given the highly fragmented nature of the hazardous waste
management market in Italy, we were the second largest company by volume over the same period, with the
leading company accounting for approximately 7% of the total volume of hazardous waste. In addition, we are
the number one player in the Italian oil regeneration space, with an approximately 89% market share as of
December 31, 2019, and a market leader in Europe in terms of oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market
share measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output in 2019. We are also the leading company in the
Italian waste solvent purification space, with a 50% market share by revenue, and the largest European player by
capacity in 2019, with an approximately 37% share of the Italian market.

**_Leadership position in defensive and profitable markets, benefiting from high entry barriers_**

We operate in markets characterized by high barriers to entry. The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy
accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits from higher barriers to entry compared to
industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste due to strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical
skills required for the waste management processes. Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste
market in Italy has shown profitability and resiliency during periods of economic difficulties, recording a CAGR
of approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014, compared to a negative CAGR of 2.2% and a CAGR of 0.2%
during the same period for the Italian urban waste market and non-hazardous waste market, respectively, and a
negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP over the same period. The resilience of our business in a
challenging macro-economic environment was also displayed by our results for the year ended December 31,
2020 when despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue remained relatively flat as compared to
2019, on a like-for-like basis.

Leveraging upon our strong and strategic local presence, especially in the most industrialized areas of Italy, we
believe that our Environment business unit is advantageously positioned as a one-stop shop for producers of
hazardous waste, alongside our Regeneration and Purification business units. We believe that our longstanding
experience with hazardous waste, highly skilled staff and advanced waste management plants give us a strong
competitive advantage over national competitors. In addition, the complexity of the authorization, certification,
compliance and operational requirements in the waste management industry (especially with regard to the
hazardous waste market), along with our geographical proximity to customers, also serve as natural barriers to
entry.

Through our Regeneration business unit, we hold a market leading position in Italy. We held approximately 89%
of the market share of the Italian oil regeneration market by volume in 2019, and we are a leading company in
Europe in terms of oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share measured by maximum regenerated
lubricant oil output in 2019. We believe that our economies of scale, proprietary technologies and contracted

133


-----

waste streams, also in light of the CONOU framework, provide us with a strong competitive advantage.
Furthermore, the Italian used oil regeneration market requires significant upfront investment and is also
characterized by complex authorization, certification and operational requirements, which serve as additional
barriers to entry.

Our Purification business has the largest installed capacity in the European waste solvent purification industry, at
approximately 100 thousand tons per year, and we held 50% of the market share of the Italian waste solvent
purification market by revenue in 2019. Reinforced by our circular partnership and established relationships with
leading players in the pharmaceutical sector, we have also built strong positions in international end-markets,
including leading positions in the waste-based thinner segments in Africa and the Middle East (with a market
share of 38% and 37% by volumes, respectively, in 2019) and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe (with a
34% market share in 2019). We believe that our economies of scale, know-how, proprietary technologies and
long-term partnerships with a loyal customer base have enabled our Purification business unit to secure and
maintain market leading positions in Italy and Europe. In addition, the Italian solvent purification market is
characterized by high barriers to entry, underpinned by requirements for significant upfront investment and the
complexity of the authorization, certification, compliance and operational processes.

We believe our competitors’ limited ability to replicate our business model also resides in our advanced R&D
capabilities across our business units. Over the years, we have internalized value-adding processes, and
developed products and waste treatment methods in partnership with our customers. This has created an
intangible barrier, which does not solely rely on commercial relationships, but on years of expertise matured in
close collaboration with our customers (such as, for example, our collaboration with API producers for the joint
development of formulas for waste optimization in our Purification business unit). Furthermore, our ability to
produce high-purity aliphatic solvents from virgin materials, combined with our trading activities relating to
these products, allows us to establish increasingly solid and synergistic relationships with our customers and
present our Purification business unit as a one-stop shop for high-purity aliphatic solvents. Our Purification
business unit benefits from an authorized capacity for the production of non-waste finished products, such as
virgin materials, of additional 100 thousand tons per year.

**_State-of-the-art plants and well-proven proprietary technology_**

We operate 13 waste treatment and recycling facilities in Italy and 12 waste storage sites. Our strong
geographical footprint and the density of our operational network in Northern Italy, especially in the Northern
regions of Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna, allow us to benefit from
economies of scale in managing complex logistics and the input sourcing reach of our production. These factors
also improve our efficiency by minimizing the logistical burden and costs of transporting our raw materials to
our facilities. In addition, our wide-reaching asset base enables geographical proximity to our customer base and
ensures extensive coverage of the Italian market. Set forth below is a chart representing the location of our waste
management sites as of June 30, 2021.

134


-----

We also operate two stand-alone laboratories for chemical and environmental analysis. Supported by a network
of 18 waste management companies, our Environment business has an overall authorized capacity of
approximately 900 thousand tons per year. Approximately 559 thousand tons of waste were processed through
the waste storage and treatment plants of our Environment business unit for the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, while additional 338 thousand tons were sold through the trading activities of our Environment business
unit during the same period. Underpinned by over 50 years of experience in the production of quality lubricating
bases through a proprietary re-refining process, our Regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano have a
combined treatment capacity of 214 thousand tons per year. Approximately 184 thousand tons of used oil were
processed through our oil regeneration plants for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our Purification
business unit comprises two plants for purification and blending of solvents with an authorized capacity of
99 thousand tons per year for solvent and chemical purification deriving from waste, 100 thousand tons per year
for solvent purification (e.g., for virgin materials) and chemical synthesis and 75 thousand tons per year for our
blending plant in Rho, near Milan. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we treated 94 thousand tons for
solvent and chemical purification deriving from waste (of which 57 thousand tons were subsequently blended
and packed in our blending plant as well) and we treated 38 thousand tons for solvent purification (e.g., for virgin
materials) and chemical synthesis.

In connection with our waste management operations, we also own and maintain a fleet of more than 120
collection trucks and other industrial vehicles. Our fleet helps secure the waste we collect, allows us to adapt to
individual client needs, improves our service offering and makes regulatory compliance easier, particularly
regarding the different transportation requirements for specific types of waste.

Our state-of-the-art plants, extensive chemical know-how, designed industrial processes and proprietary
technologies, underpinned by 14 registered patents, allow us to act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps
for industrial waste streams. Our Regeneration business benefits from a patented proprietary process for the
productions of lubricant bases, which is now widely used by leading lubrication companies worldwide. See also
“Business—Research & Development, Technology and Innovation.”

In addition, we seek continuous technological improvement by leveraging upon several established partnerships
with leading Italian universities.

**_Highly resilient business with outstanding growth backed by diversified revenues streams, solid profitability_**
**_and cash generation_**

The strengths described above, coupled with attractive industry fundamentals, have enabled us to deliver strong
and consistent financial performance. The solid relationships with our clients, their end-market diversification,
along with the pricing stability levers inherent in our business, have allowed us to build a resilient business
model with high visibility over revenue and profitability performance and operating cash generation. Anticipated
structural growth in our end-markets (with an estimated CAGR of approximately 7% in the Italian hazardous
waste market over the period 2021-2025), supported by structural imbalance between demand and supply, high
switching costs for our customers and our entrenched presence in the most densely industrialized regions of Italy,
are expected to generate premium economics in our business units. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee,
which is inversely correlated to the market price of lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lube oil
market price and vice versa), provides our Regeneration segment with downside protection against periods of
low prices of crude oil and lubricant oil and supports a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our
oil-based products. The chart below shows the resilience of our Regeneration business unit despite fluctuations of
oil prices over the period 2018-2020.

Since 2018, we have achieved revenue and profitability growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions. Our
revenue increased by 18.5%, from €279.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €330.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020. Our EBITDA increased by 11.1%, from €45.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to being a highly cash
generative business, we have limited capital expenditure requirements, with our adjusted recurring capital
expenditure being equivalent to less than 3% of our revenue on average over the period from 2018 to 2020.

The resilience of our business model was underscored during the year ended December 31, 2020, when despite
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin on a
constant perimeter basis remained broadly in line with results recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019
and with two of our three business units (i.e., Environment and Purification) delivering growth.

Furthermore, while our operating sites and plants are exclusively based in Italy, we benefit from a large
international commercial footprint underpinned by a strong network of international distributors acting locally
within key jurisdictions worldwide, which enables us to geographically diversify our revenue streams. For the
twelve months ended June 30, 2021, 21.1% of our revenue was generated abroad in over 60 countries. The
graphic below presents the breadth of our international commercial footprint.

**_ESG-centric corporate mission, making sustainability the cornerstone of an advanced circular economy model_**

Sustainability is at the core of our corporate mission. Our business model is focused on maximizing (i) the use of
recycled raw materials, (ii) the transformation efficiency of industrial processes and (iii) the most sustainable
destinations for generated waste. Our business model is underpinned by robust Environmental, Social and
Governance (“ESG”) programs, with the circularity index of our business standing at approximately 90%. We
have prepared an annual Sustainability Report for the last 15 years and constantly track ESG metrics. We have
introduced a Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”) in 2020 to serve as the cornerstone of sustainability
management within the Itelyum Group, being tasked with reviewing and updating our sustainability strategies,
verifying the state of implementation of our initiatives and deploying operational mandates to our group
companies. The SSC is chaired by an independent and highly reputable advisor and comprises the members of
our board of directors and the Chief Sustainability Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we avoided
the generation of approximately 470 thousand tons of CO2 necessary for the production of virgin products
substituted by recycled products and one thousand tons of air pollutants, generated annual savings of
approximately 14 million cubic meters of water and avoided the consumption of 400 hectares of land. We
promote self-production of electricity and partially rely on the electricity generated by our three photovoltaic
plants, with an installed capacity of over 800 kilowatts, and our high-efficiency cogeneration plant, with an
average production capacity of over 46 million kilowatt-hours, to sustain our operations. In addition, in
accordance with our newly established Sustainability Performance Targets, we aim to achieve (i) a 25% increase
in gross CO2 avoided emissions for the year ending December 31, 2025, compared to the baseline of 430,449.6
tons of CO2 for the year ended December 31, 2020; and (ii) a 25% increase in the quantity of waste collected and
delivered to circular treatment for the year ending December 31, 2025, compared to the baseline of 574,184 tons
of waste for the year ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, through our sustainability policy, we aim to
contribute to the achievement of the following nine major Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”):

We remain focused on promoting internationally recognized human rights and guaranteeing working conditions
based on equal opportunities and development of skills in a context that considers diversity as a true source of
value. We are committed to allocating considerable resources to the creation of social value through business
integrity and stakeholder relations, including through new training initiatives that propose to increase
sustainability-focused trainings for our staff from 17 hours per year per individual in 2019 to 30 hours per year
per individual by 2025. We also believe that safety, protection and promotion of health and well-being of

137


-----

individuals are fundamental values to be integrated in all our activities. This principle extends to employees,
companies, suppliers, visitors, local communities and any other stakeholder included in our sphere of influence.
We are committed to taking concrete measures aimed at eliminating accidents, injuries and illnesses caused by
work activities and reducing risks in all our activities. In 2020, our frequency index risk (calculated as number of
accidents (with absence from work for more than 24 hours) per million hours of work) was 5.8.

We have also implemented strong operational risk management and compliance systems aimed at risk
prevention, and strive to continuously improve our environmental performance and management systems. Our
environmental management system is equipped with established standards and processes and is built around the
principles of ISO 45001 and ISO 14001, which certifies our commitment to sustainable solutions and advanced
health and safety standards. Most of our waste management facilities, including the oil regeneration plants of
Ceccano and Pieve Fissiraga, hold ISO 14001 certifications of compliance with advanced environmental
standards.

As a member of the United Nations Global Compact, we strive to implement the best practices in terms of
governance through internal committee monitoring, independent supervision as well as the adoption of relevant
codes, protocols and policies. Leveraging upon 13 globally recognized management systems, reference protocols
and certifications, we have implemented a formal code of ethics and an organizational, management and control
model across each of our group companies, and have also appointed an independent supervisory board to oversee
our robust governance practices. See also “Business—Sustainability, Environment, Social and Governance.”

**_Experienced management team widely recognized in the industry, supported by a solid organizational_**
**_structure_**

We have an experienced senior management team providing strong leadership across all functional areas of our
business, overseen by our chief executive officer (“CEO”) who has over 20 years of experience in leading
national and international companies. With an average of more than ten years of industry experience, our
management team is aligned to execute on the Itelyum Group’s growth strategy and has a proven track record in
delivering growth and profitability by identifying profitable growth opportunities and effective integration
processes, which we believe provide us with a significant competitive advantage over our competitors. In
addition, our chairman, CEO and three senior managers on our board of directors are members of a number of
industry-recognized Italian and international associations, including Federchimica, UNEM (Unione Energie per
_la Mobilità), GEIR (Groupement Européen de l’Industrie de la Régénération), ESRG (European Solvent_
Recycler Group), CONOU, COBAT (Consorzio nazionale batterie esauste) and the UN Global Compact Italy.

**Our Strategy**

**_Focus on organic growth driven by promoting synergies across business units_**

We plan to drive organic growth by continuing to optimize our integrated platform across our business units. In
particular, we have launched, and expect to launch over the medium term, a number of key initiatives aimed at
unlocking commercial synergies in our end-to-end waste management solutions and promoting cross-divisional
opportunities for the optimization of waste supply and cost management.

These key initiatives include, among others: (i) leveraging on our wide Environment platform network to
reinforce the value proposition offered to our customer base across our Regeneration and Purification business
units through increased marketing, distribution and procurement synergies; (ii) securing an optimized feedstock
supply via collection integration; (iii) enhancing the sharing of technology solutions and best practices to allow
continuous improvement and operational efficiency; (iv) creating a centralized warehouse for spare parts and
maintenance team, thus reducing unexpected unavailability or operational difficulties, in particular for our Pieve
Fissiraga and Ceccano oil regeneration plants; and (v) rationalizing our vehicle fleet and optimizing routes for
inbound and outbound transportation of waste and raw materials.

**_Leverage strategic and expansion projects with highly visible financial impact to increase production capacity,_**
**_improve profitability and expand product offering_**

We plan to continue pursuing special operational projects with highly visible financial impact, especially aimed
at increasing treated and recycled waste volumes and expanding the authorized capacity of our plants. One of
these projects relates to the expansion of our waste water treatment capacity by approximately 120 thousand tons
per year, mainly relating to captive volumes generated by Temix Oleo S.r.l. We also seek to expand our waste
storage, treatment and tank capacity through expansion projects at our existing plants.

138


-----

In addition, we expect to diversify the product range of our Regeneration business unit and broaden its client base
by increasing our focus on high value-added lubricant oils. We also aim to maximize our plant capacity by
pursuing continuous technological improvements, upgrades to our production equipment and investments in
R&D projects.

Furthermore, we expect to expand the revenue generating capacity of our Purification business unit by investing
in special projects, primarily aimed at expanding capacity at our purification and blending plants and adding new
product lines to our portfolio. For example, we plan to invest approximately €17 million over the period 20212025 to (i) expand the production capacity of thinners and SFW products by increasing the production capacity
of our existing plants and the acquisition of new plants and (ii) establish new product lines for our starting
material for active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”).

**_Pursue value-accretive and strategic acquisitions to expand and consolidate our platform_**

We intend to continue to deploy an acquisition strategy that focuses on acquiring and integrating small and
medium-sized regional and national businesses. Our latest acquisition, Castiglia, is headquartered in Puglia, a
region in the south of Italy, and provides integrated services for environmental protection and sustainability with
a particular focus on the management of waste deriving from water purification processes. Through the
acquisition of Castiglia, we expect to enhance our market position in the Southern regions of Italy.

We believe that our reputation and track record in the Italian waste management market leads to us being chosen
by specialist and generalist waste management businesses as a natural market consolidator. Once an acquisition
is executed, we seek to implement a well-defined integration process that includes coordinating administration,
finance and treasury, IT, human resources and other support functions with our central management functions,
and seek to leverage our national network and commercial structure in order to increase the waste volumes
processed at the sites that are acquired.

The Italian waste management market remains highly fragmented, with more than 90% of companies that operate
in the market employing fewer than 50 full-time employees, which offers growth opportunities for leading
players such as Itelyum. Our strong geographical footprint and diverse product portfolio create opportunities for
acquisitions that bolster our existing platform. Excluding acquisitions made in the last 24 months, the Adjusted
EBITDA of companies we acquired grew at an average CAGR of more than 60% over the two years that
followed the relevant acquisitions. We intend to selectively consider further bolt-on or strategic acquisitions to
capitalize on our competitive strengths, extend our territorial coverage and preserve or improve our financial
performance and profitability. We may seek to consolidate our leading positioning in our core verticals or expand
into new, complementary verticals. In addition, we may in the future enter new geographies and seek to leverage
our core expertise and know-how by penetrating new European markets, such as the industrial waste
management, the oil regeneration or the pharmaceutical purification markets. We plan to continue to take a
disciplined approach to evaluating potential investments and maintain prudent overall liquidity and leverage.

**History**

Our business dates back to 1963, when we were established as Viscolube S.r.l. (“Viscolube”), an oil regeneration
company located in the province of Lodi in the Italian region of Lombardy. Through the following decades, we
have significantly grown as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions of strategic companies and assets,
including the acquisition of the Ceccano oil regeneration plant from Eni S.p.A. in 2001, which helped us
establishing our position as a leading Italian used oil regeneration company.

In 2011, Viscolube was acquired by Stirling Square Capital Partners, along with minority investors, with the goal
of pursuing a transformational path towards becoming a diversified platform in the circular economy space.
Between 2013 and 2015, we enhanced our growth trajectory through the acquisition of several players in the
Italian waste management industry specialized in the collection, transportation, storage and treatment of solid and
liquid waste, including Sepi Ambiente S.r.l. in 2013, Recoil S.r.l., Rimondi Paolo S.r.l. and Neda Ambiente FGV
S.r.l. in 2014, as well as the acquisition of a number of waste collectors and waste pre-treatment platforms in
2015, including Deluca Servizi Ambiente S.r.l., which further strengthened our Environment solutions and
treatment of emulsion.

In 2016, SSCP Fund III acquired a control stake in Viscolube. Over the following years, we have established our
position in the Italian waste solvent market through the acquisition of leading Italian players. In 2017, we
acquired Bitolea Chimica Ecologica S.r.l. (subsequently renamed Itelyum Purification), a company specialized in

139


-----

the recycling and recovering of used solvents and the production of pure solvents. Between 2018 and 2020, we
continued to pursue growth opportunities that allowed us to further expand our Environment business unit by
expanding our geographical coverage, client base and the breadth of waste streams collected and services offered,
such as the acquisition of Centro Risorse S.r.l. in 2018, and Idroclean S.r.l. and Ferolmet S.r.l. in 2020.

In 2019, we undertook a rebranding process leading to the establishment of the Itelyum brand and the associated
trademarks, which identify all companies of the Itelyum Group that were previously operating under a number of
separate brands.

We operate across the waste management value chain (excluding direct management of landfill and incineration
and urban waste). We have a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities and benefit from a strong
chemical know-how and access to treatment and recycling alternatives for complex hazardous waste streams.

We believe that the combination of our business units have enabled us to build a significant competitive
advantage within the Italian waste management market, establishing our position as a leading one-stop shop
service provider of circular economy solutions for a wide range of customers across various industries. For the
twelve month ended June 30, 2021, we directly managed approximately 837 thousand tons of waste materials
(excluding intermediated waste), primarily consisting of lube oil, solvents, industrial hazardous water, waste
treatment for energy valorization and other waste, with hazardous and non-hazardous waste accounting for 71%
and 29%, respectively, of these volumes, and solid and liquid waste accounting for 19% and 81%, respectively,
of these volumes. Over the same period, we processed approximately 338 thousand tons of waste though our
trading activities.

A portion of the waste volumes managed through our Environment business activities is provided to our
Regeneration and Purification businesses and, in turn, our Environment business processes a portion of the waste
volumes produced by our Regeneration and Purification business activities, thus providing our overall business
with captive solutions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, 32 thousand tons of used oil collected by
Environment were provided to Regeneration.

**_CONOU Incentive Mechanisms_**

Regeneration activities in Italy benefit from a specific framework aimed at supporting collection and
regeneration of used oil. CONOU is a private Italian consortium established in 1984 to promote and support

143


-----

waste oil collection and regeneration activities in Italy. Today, CONOU has relations with over sixty used oil
collectors and has set up an incentive mechanism paid to oil regeneration companies, the CONOU regeneration
treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lube oil (i.e. the fee increases upon a decrease
in lube oil market price and vice versa), thus ensuring that Itelyum and other players in the regeneration industry
are granted certain downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lube oil prices. The CONOU
regeneration treatment fee is paid to oil regeneration companies on a monthly basis based on the volumes of
regenerated oil bases produced and is calculated based on the ICIS average price of lube oil recorded during the
preceding quarter. The regeneration treatment fee granted by CONOU sustains the circularity in all the phases of
the waste oil economic cycle and permits us to offset the cyclical decrease in oil price by guaranteeing a
minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products; therefore strengthen the resilience of our
Regeneration business unit vis-a-vis fluctuations in oil price. See also “Industry” and “Regulation.”

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the CONOU regeneration treatment fee accounted for 25.8% of
revenue from our Regeneration activities for the period. CONOU regeneration treatment fee for each quarter is
calculated on the basis of the ICIS average price of lube oil recorded in the preceding quarter and is paid on a
monthly basis.

**_Purification_**

Our Purification business unit comprises complex recycling and production activities covering a wide range of
solvents and thinners derived from the purification of pharmaceutical and chemical waste streams. Our
purification plant in Landriano (near Milan) is specialized in recycling and recovery of used solvents, production
of pure solvents and synthesis of API starting materials, providing us with the largest installed recycling capacity
in Europe at approximately 100 thousand tons of authorized capacity per year for waste purification. Our plant in
Rho (near Milan) provides bottling and logistics services that are functional to the operation of our Landriano
plant. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 93.7 and 23.0 thousand tons of used solvents
and pure solvents were processed through our Landriano plant, respectively.

_Purification solutions_

Our Purification portfolio comprises the following solutions:

    - **_Thinners. We produce and sell a wide range of recovered thinners derived from used solvent, primarily_**
obtained from pharmaceutical companies. Our thinner products are principally used for tool cleaning,
paints, inks and varnishes, construction and other chemical applications, such as the dilution of viscous
substances.

    - **_Solvents from waste (“SFW”). We produce high-grade solvents (e.g., acetone, isopropanol,_**
tetrahydrofuran (“THF”), methyl tert-butyl ether (“MTBE”), methanol and acetates) and resins
obtained from the purification of waste solvents. Our SFW products are used in a diversified range of
industries, including API, chemical as well power generation and clay target production.

    - **_Pure solvents. We produce specialty and technical aliphatic solvents (e.g., pentane, hexane and_**
heptane) derived from the processing of pure virgin materials, such as virgin naphtha and
tetrahydrofuran. Our pure solvents are primarily used in API production, production of chemicals and
adhesives, as well as in the power generation and oil extraction sectors.

    - **_Starting materials for API. We produce highly specialized starting materials for API and custom-made_**
products through complex chemical processes. These products primarily are sold to a leading U.S.
based pharmaceutical company, with an important presence in Italy.

    - **_Trading. We engage in trading activities that complement our Purification offering and primarily cover_**

Our Environment business has a loyal customer base comprising approximately 30,000 accounts. Our customers
include leading Italian consortia (e.g. CONOU and COBAT (Consortium for Spent Lead Batteries and Lead
Waste)), medium-large companies and small medium enterprises (“SMEs”), in certain instances on the basis of
full-service agreements over a multi-year framework. More than 100 customers account for more than 500 tons
of managed waste per year each and represent approximately 50% of our total managed waste volumes; among
these customers, other waste management companies account for approximately 15% of our total managed waste
volume per year. Contracts with large corporations and other waste management players have an average
duration of approximately one year, with approximately 80% of our customers who account for more than 500 of
tons of managed waste per year each having been associated with us for over three years. Periodic price
adjustments on an annual or six month basis are set out for contracts with large clients, while contracts with
SMEs typically provide for agreed pricelists which are periodically updated based on customer needs, type of
waste and volumes. Key customers include CONOU, COBAT, COREPLA, Hera, A2A, Iren, Basf and
Fincantieri. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the top 10 customers and top 20 customers for our
Environment business unit generated 16.6% and 24.0%, respectively, of revenue from our Environment
activities.

**_Regeneration_**

Our Regeneration business benefits from long-standing relationships with a selected customer base comprised of
approximately 80 customers, including the majority of the oil & gas companies operating in Italy. Key customers
include Eni, Total and Petronas. For the most part, our Regeneration products are sold pursuant to standardized
contracts with an average length of one to three years providing for a correlation between the sale price and the
ICIS lube oil price index, as well as the volumes forecast for the period. We also enter into spot orders in the
context of framework agreements with long standing customers, with pricing terms indexed to ICIS prices.
Multi-year agreements constitute approximately 40% of our volumes, with relationships with a number of key
customers averaging over ten years. Our customer base has seen an increase of 80% over the past 10 years, with
more than 20 customers (most based outside Italy) added over the last two years to a historical customer base of
more than 50 customers. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top 10 accounts and top 20 accounts in
our Regeneration business unit (excluding CONOU) generated 33.1% and 45.7%, respectively, of revenue from
our Regeneration activities.

**_Purification_**

Our Purification products are sold to a geographically diversified and loyal base primarily comprised of
customers and distributors in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, approximately 28% of the volume of our Purification products were sold in Middle East and Africa, 66%
in Italy and 7% in the rest of the world. Our relationship with a number of key customers ranges from five to ten
years. Key customers include Bidachem, Abbvie, FIS Fabbrica Italiana Sintetici, Abro Industries, Brussa and
Versalis.

Thinner products are mainly sold to distributors for paint and varnishing pursuant to standardized contracts
setting out purchase volumes ranging from three to six months, with spot prices based on type and quality of
thinner and size of packaging. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 50% of the volume of
SFW products were sold via yearly contracts, while traded volumes are mainly sold on a spot order basis over the
same period, approximately 60% of the volume of pure solvents were sold through yearly contracts, with price
indexed to virgin naphtha (and thus creating a natural price hedge for approximately one-third of our products),
while the rest was sold on a spot order basis. Starting materials for APIs are typically sold to a leading U.S. based
pharmaceutical company with an important presence in Italy based on a three-year contracts with minimumguaranteed volumes and fixed prices. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the top 10 accounts and top 20
accounts for our Purification business unit generated 36.6% and 46.1%, respectively, of revenue from our
Purification activities.

**Suppliers**

Most of the waste we manage require the waste producer to pay a fee to Itelyum; therefore, such waste suppliers
also represent customers to the Itelyum Group’s business. This is particularly the case of our Environment and
Purification business units, where the waste supplied to us is used for our waste recovery and recycling
processes. In respect of certain type of waste, such as used batteries, we pay fees to the waste producers that
supply the waste to us without such producers paying any amount to us for the waste collection we carry out.

**_Environment_**

We have long standing relationships with a number of key suppliers, which primarily include incineration
players, waste recovery and disposal companies and brokerage transport companies. Our supplying contracts
typically range from six months to one year. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the top 10 suppliers and
top 20 suppliers in our Environment business unit accounted for 25.0% and 33.1%, respectively, of volumes
supplied to us for the period.

**_Regeneration_**

The majority of the used oil that we process in our Regeneration activities is supplied to us by the approximately
60 used oil collectors affiliated with CONOU. Supplying arrangements with the CONOU oil collectors are
typically regulated by individual standardized contracts with a typical duration of three years, which are currently
expected to expire in December 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, CONOU-affiliated companies
supplied approximately 93% of the volume of used oil supplied to us for the period. Approximately 7% of the
volume of used oil supplied to us over the same period came from companies operating in bordering countries,
such as France and Austria, pursuant to long-term framework agreements. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, the top 10 suppliers and top 20 suppliers in our Regeneration business unit accounted for 63.7% and
70.8%, respectively, of volumes supplied to us for the period, with CONOU-affiliated oil collectors alone
accounting for 38.4% of the volumes supplied to us for this period.

**_Purification_**

In our Purification business unit, we typically enter into individual contracts with selected suppliers for each of
our product categories, primarily petrochemical, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, with an average length
of one to three years. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the top 10 suppliers and top 20 suppliers in our
Purification business unit accounted for 45.6% and 61.6%, respectively, of volumes supplied to us for the period.

**Geographical Footprint, Real Estate and Equipment**

We are headquartered in Pieve Fissiraga (Lodi), Italy. We have a strong geographical footprint in Italy,
especially in the Northern regions of Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna.
We also operate collection and storage sites in Umbria and the Ceccano oil regeneration plant in the province of
Frosinone, Lazio.

In connection with our waste management operations, we also own and maintain a fleet of more than 120
collection trucks and other industrial vehicles. We view our fleet of vehicles as an important asset for our
operations and therefore ensure that our vehicles are covered by an adequate level of insurance, well-maintained
and in good working order through scheduled maintenance programs. Our fleet helps secure the waste we collect,
allows us to adapt to individual customer needs, improves our service offering and makes regulatory compliance
easier, particularly regarding the different transportation requirements for specific types of waste.

We believe our equipment is in good condition and suitable for the purposes for which such equipment is being
used. In addition, we believe we have sufficient capacity to meet our obligations to our customers.

**Intellectual Property**

We rely on a combination of trademarks, license agreements and non-disclosure agreements to protect our
proprietary rights. In particular, our trademarked brand name, Itelyum, is an important element of our brand
awareness and customer loyalty. We have a number of other important brands in our portfolio that we have
acquired and developed throughout our history. These include Viscolube and Revivoil. In addition, certain waste
management and production processes, particularly in our Regeneration business, are protected by patents and
benefits from an advanced stage of digitalization. We currently hold 14 registered patents, primarily relating to
our Regeneration business, and we are in the process of registering four additional patents.

In addition, we employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third
parties, employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets and know-how. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Business—Third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.” At present, we believe our_
business is not materially dependent on patents, intellectual property licenses, trademarks or licenses from third
parties. There are, in our view, no patents, intellectual property licenses, trademarks or licenses from third parties
necessary for the operation of our business that we do not have or cannot readily attain.

**Employees**

For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had a workforce comprised of 692 employees on average. Our
employee count has grown steadily from 162 employees on average in 2011 to our current headcount, as a result
of acquisitions and organic growth.

All of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees’ representation includes the
main Italian unions. From time to time, our operating sites may experience union organizing efforts. During the
past ten years, we have not experienced any local strikes or work stoppages. We currently have no disputes or
bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business and our management
believes we have good relations with our employees and unions.

**Competition**

The Italian waste management market is highly competitive and fragmented, comprised of a variety of small,
medium-size and large players. We compete with a large number of small local companies specialized in selected
aspects of the waste management process, including Marazzato, Vidori and Venanzieffe. These local familyowned companies comprise the majority of the Italian market. In addition, we face competition from waste
management branches of established national multiutility companies, such as A2A Ambiente, Iren and
HERAmbiente. Furthermore, we compete against structured private groups, such as Ecoeridania, Riccoboni,
Ambienthesis and Mecomer. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We operate in a highly
_competitive and fragmented market, and competition from established companies as well as local specialized_
_competitors could have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.”_

We believe we have several competitive advantages over a number of our competitors. Some of these advantages
include the breadth of our service offering and strong territorial coverage thanks to our integrated network of
plants in Northern Italy, our longstanding experience in the waste management industry, the technological
advancement of our production processes and our strong and consolidated relationship with pharmaceutical
customers. For more information about the competitive landscape in which we operate, see “Industry.”

**IT and Internal Control Systems**

Our information systems handle our information flow in accordance with the procedures established under our
quality standards and allow us to monitor the security and reliability of our information. We have a dedicated
team of IT personal working in close contact with our consultants and third-party providers of IT solutions,
which include leading companies in the Italian IT industry. We are currently implementing a number of IT
initiatives aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our software and infrastructure, including
through the modernization and standardization of our IT hardware and software and the enhancement of the IT
security features.

In order to further improve our operational capabilities, we plan to implement a digital strategy that would allow
us, inter alia, to reduce unplanned downtime, obtain real -time visibility into asset usage and extend equipment
life span.

**Research & Development (“R&D”), Technology and Innovation**

Our Regeneration business benefits from a patented proprietary process for the productions of lubricant bases,
which is now used by leading lubrication companies worldwide. Specifically, the Revivoil technology, developed
in collaboration with the French company Axens, allows the highest control of product quality and environmental
performance and enables the production of base oils with low sulfur and unsaturated content and a very low
content of aromatic compounds.

In addition, we seek continuous technological improvement by leveraging upon several established partnerships
with distinctive Italian universities, such as Politecnico di Milano and Università di Roma Sapienza. Our ongoing
R&D projects include process and product research projects that cover a range of environmental-related
initiatives aimed at reducing the environmental impact of our operations as well as other innovative solutions that
are expected to expand our product portfolio and generate operational improvements.

Our primary ongoing R&D projects include:

    - valorization of plastic waste;

    - re-use of treated waste water in industrial processes, which will enhance the circularity of our oil
regeneration processes;

148


-----

    - development of CO2 capture technology aimed at reducing CO2 emissions by approximately
85 thousand tons per year;

    - production of recycled asphalt from bitumen and additives from other recycling streams (including
cellulosic waste, rubber powder, waste catalysists), which will lower the cost of our waste production
and enhance the value of bitumen products; and

    - production of biolubrificants and biosolvents from used vegetable oil, which will expand our product
portfolio, and production capacity increase of additional 30 thousand tons.

**Sustainability, Environment, Social and Governance**

Itelyum embraces and publicly supports its core values of integrity, diversity, efficiency, responsibility and
innovation as a guide for its daily activities and transforms them into strategies, shared objectives and operational
programs. In line with the highest standards of business integrity, we have the ambition to create value and
fostering economic development supported by innovation, environmental protection and improved quality of life.
Our business model is focused on the maximization of the use of recycled raw materials, the efficiency of our
industrial processes and the valorization of the most sustainable destinations for our waste. Reaching these
objectives requires constant involvement and transparent communication with local communities, stakeholders,
institutions, non-governmental organizations and representatives of the public and private sectors.

All our companies apply principles of equality to all stakeholders, from employees, contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers to customers, end users and all those involved in the sphere of influence of the industry in which we
operate. We believe that each source of well-being and use of natural or financial resources shall not be neglected
or wasted, but valorized. Our mission is to help saving natural resources and improving the quality of life though
our sustainable processes, products and solutions for waste management and the optimization of markets we
serve, sharing creation of value with our business partners, the society and the environment.

Our sustainability policy is inspired by the highest international standards (i.e., the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Conventions, Protocols and
Recommendations of the Organization International Labor, the SA8000 standards, ISO 26000 and the Global
Reporting Initiative). We also participate in the United Nations Global Compact, the world’s largest strategic
initiative on sustainability built on the effort to promote a global economy that respects human and labor rights,
environmental protection and the fight against corruption. Furthermore, we support the Sustainable Development
Goals issued by the United Nations in 2015, which inspire the actions of governments, civil society, stakeholders
and individuals. Our sustainability policy applies to all group activities, business partnerships, acquired
companies, and in all activities involving our stakeholders. In order to ensure its effectiveness, this policy is
subject to periodic review and update. Our sustainability policy is built around the following four “guiding
principles”:

    - Health and Safety

    - Environment and Resources

    - Rights and Society

    - Quality and Responsibility

**_Health and Safety_**

We believe that safety, protection and promotion of health and well-being of individuals are fundamental values
to be integrated in all our activities. This principle extends to employees, companies, suppliers, visitors, local
communities and any other stakeholder included in its sphere of influence. We are committed to taking concrete
measures to eliminate accidents, injuries and illnesses caused by work activities, reducing risks in all its
activities. We also aim to achieve the highest levels of collective and individual awareness, encouraging a
process of continuous improvement through the adoption of effective management systems and visible
leadership.

All employees are properly trained and equipped to perform their job in fully safe and healthy conditions. Our
key Health and Safety policy pillars include the following:

    - ensuring that all facilities and equipment are designed, built, used and maintained in order to minimize
health and safety risks, adopting the best available techniques in new installations or in case of
revamping or replacement of existing ones;

149


-----

    - adopting operational standards of excellence for the main activities and provides the operational tools
to ensure their full application in all sites;

    - performing regular checks at the workplace and adequate health surveillance to monitor workers
exposure and prevent any risk that may compromise their health and safety;

    - adopting management systems subject to regular audit activities and periodic updates;

    - promoting transparent and effective information, using the most appropriate tools for both reporting
and analysis of incidental events, and timely sharing of best practices and improvement actions;

    - ensuring that all employees participate regularly in training courses and develop a personal sensitivity
towards the culture of health and safety, adopting responsible behaviors at work and promoting its
application as lifestyle.

The health and safety objective extends to local communities, especially in the four sites of the group that
according to the legislation are classified at “major-accident hazard” due to the volume of storage of flammable
or potentially toxic substances for human health or for the environment. In these sites, dedicated protocols and
measures are adopted, also involving local communities, with a real integrated management system aimed at risk
prevention, according to the best practice of the sector.

Supported by strong health and safety policies, no fatality was recorded over the past five years. Our last fatality
was recorded in 2016 due to a third party involved in a road accident outside company premises. All serious
accidents or situations that could potentially have generated more serious consequences from a health and safety
perspective are discussed at the highest corporate level and our board of directors is updated monthly on the trend
of safety indicators.

**_Environment and Resources_**

Our business model is based on circularity, maximizing the use of recycled raw materials. We are committed to
prevent, minimize, mitigate and compensate the environmental footprint generated by our activities and we
recognize the need for a pro-active transition to a circular and low-carbon economy, capable of mitigating the
impact on society at the same time. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our recycling of used oils, solvents
and chemical streams has created net environmental value, helping to avoid the emissions of almost
470 thousand tons of CO2; the release of over one thousand tons of air pollutants; the withdrawal of
approximately14 million cubic meters of water. The following table sets forth the material balance of waste
material and circularity of our processes by business unit for the year ended December 2018, 2019 and 2020:

Our activities are energy intensive. Our oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano and the Landriano
solvent purification plant consume both thermal and electrical energy. In all three plants, electricity demand is
largely supported by high-efficiency cogeneration. In our Environment business unit, we primarily use electricity
purchased from the grid and fuel for our fleet. In order to partially offset our energy consumption, we own and
operate three photovoltaic fields, for a total installed power of over 800 kW, which self-produce and inject
electricity into the grid.

Our plants in Pieve Fissiraga, Ceccano and Landriano fall within the scope of the European Emission Trading
System, partly benefiting from free CO2 allocations, and are therefore subjected to specific environmental
accounting rules and third-party verification. The combination of optimization initiatives implemented in the
most energy intensive sites ensure specific consumption and carbon intensity in line with the best practices of the
sector. In addition, fleets of managed vehicles generate emissions in proportion to the mileage and the type of
fleet in circulation. Our most significant emissions are subject to periodic measurement campaigns and, in some
cases, are covered by continuous monitoring systems of the main emission parameters. In addition, the
production of lube bases and solvents by recycling industrial wastes permits to avoid significant quantities of
CO2 when compared to production processes from virgin resources.

At our operating sites, we use water resources to meet our supply needs for drinking and civil use (e.g., canteens)
or for industrial use. Our industrial cycle is managed in a closed circuit as much as possible. In all sites,
discharges of industrial or meteoric waters, both in surface water streams or sewages, are equipped with modern
treatment systems that guarantee the full environmental quality of wastewater. In four of our sites, hydraulic
barrier systems are active, aimed at reducing pre-existing contamination of soils and aquifers.

We have adopted practical solutions, in collaboration with institutions and other responsible players in the
interconnected industrial and consumptions cycles, promoting the valorization of alternative resources, the design
of sustainable products and the dissemination of eco-efficient technologies and management methods. Our key
Environment and Resources policy pillars include the following:

    - ensuring that all facilities and equipment are designed, built, used and maintained in order to reduce
environmental risks, adopting the best available techniques in new plants or in case of revamping or
replacement of existing installations.

    - promoting responsible use of natural resources over the entire life cycle;

    - protecting the quality of waters and soils, safeguarding the collective usability and protecting
biodiversity and ensuring environmental management of any historical contamination of dismissed
sites and plants according to best practices;

    - maximizing the valorization in direct or indirect waste management and prioritizing the recycling,
material recovery, energy recovery and eventually adopting forms of responsible disposal, fostering
environmental and social safety;

    - proactively addressing the challenges of climate change; and

    - implementing internal standards for the assessment and monitoring of environmental performance in
order to establish and verify improvement objectives.

**_Rights and Society_**

We strongly support human rights and establish relationships with all our stakeholders. We are committed to
ensure that no human rights abuse is committed in the supply chain and in trade relations with all the countries
with which we operate. Our group companies aim to establish and maintain relations with suppliers based on

151


-----

partnerships, shared commitments and a transparent exchange of information and experience. The internal
processes for managing purchases of goods and services is aimed at ensuring compliance with internal rules,
including those concerning health and safety, and the dissemination of best practices. Suppliers and contractors
are required to respect human rights, guarantee acceptable working conditions, freedom of association, and
mitigation of environmental impacts and the rejection of any form of corruption and crime. Compliance by our
suppliers is subsequently assessed through questionnaires and verified by audit activities.

We also strive to build and maintain strong relationships with local communities by understanding their needs
and promoting sustainable local projects. We regularly involve local and national authorities and institutions
through individual or collective dialogues during the authorization phases or other institutional procedures or
through voluntary multi-stakeholder and partnership initiatives. This also includes active participation in local
trade associations, encouraging common initiatives and the dissemination of responsible business practices.
Starting from educational “open days” in our regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano and the
Landriano solvent purification plant, we intend to continue promoting the continuous contact with local
communities and all stakeholders in the territory and organizing cultural and educational initiatives.

We are also members of various national and international groups and organizations at the forefront of
sustainability efforts. Among the most significant memberships, we actively participate in CONOU,
Federchimica, UNEM (Unione Energie per la Mobilità), ESRG (European Solvent Recycler Group) and GEIR
(European association of regenerators of used mineral oils), of which it holds the presidency from 2020.

Our key Rights and Society policy pillars include the following:

    - guaranteeing equality of opportunity and treatment without distinction of sex, age, ethnicity,
nationality, social conditions and origins, religion, sexual or political orientation;

    - promoting health protection programs and initiatives towards communities affected by natural and
health disasters; and

    - supporting school education and sharing culture of sustainability particularly neighboring our
production facilities.

**_Quality and Responsibility_**

We seek to continually improve the quality of our products, processes and services. To this end, we adopt a
systematic approach aimed at meeting increasingly challenging quality requirements, creating value along the life
cycle of products and improving relations with customers and suppliers. Our sustainability efforts deeply
permeate our governance systems. Our sustainability indicators are discussed in periodic meetings with our
shareholders and in the boards of directors of our group companies, with dedicated training sessions to maintain
skills aligned with the international sustainability agenda. With the aim of further strengthening this approach, a
Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”) was introduced in 2020 to serve as cornerstone of sustainability
management within the Itelyum Group, being tasked with reviewing and updating our sustainability strategies,
verifying the state of implementation of our initiatives and deploying operational mandates to our group
companies. The SSC is chaired by an independent and highly reputable advisor and comprises the members of
the board of directors and the Chief Sustainability Officer.

Our key Quality and Responsibility policy pillars include the following:

    - adoption of methods of monitoring and control of production cycles and service activities based on
appropriate instruments, metrics and procedures, performed by qualified technicians;

    - promoting and adopting management systems according to internationally recognized reference
schemes and subject to regular audit activities and periodic updates;

    - ensuring compliance with all standards, technical norms, applicable codes of practice, market
requirements and customer requests;

    - committing to obtain and maintain the trust of suppliers and customers, guaranteeing the quality of
products, processes and services, and fair economic conditions; and

    - communicating responsibly to customers, dealers, final users and interested parties all information on
technical and environmental performance and any potential health and safety defects of our materials
and products.

152


-----

**Compliance with Applicable Regulations**

Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent governmental regulations that impose various conditions and
limitations on the treatment, acceptance, identification, storage, handling, transportation and treatment of
industrial hazardous solid and liquid waste materials and by-products, air emissions and soil contamination,
among others. See “Regulation.” We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws
and regulations governing the protection of human health and the environment, including all laws and regulations
concerning employee health and safety. We believe the following regulations are particularly relevant to our
business.

_EHS Matters_

We are committed to integrating EHS protection into our business operations. In addition to complying with
applicable laws and other voluntary obligations, we strive to continuously improve our environmental
performance and management systems. Our environmental management system is equipped with established
standards and processes and is built around the principles of ISO 45001 and ISO 14001. All of our waste
management facilities except for our purification plant in Landriano hold ISO 14001 certifications of compliance
with advanced environmental standards. We expect to obtain an ISO 14001 certification of compliance for our
purification plant in Landriano by the end of 2021.

_Italian Legislative Decree No. 231/2001_

We have taken and will continue to take action to ensure the constant and complete implementation of the best
practices for compliance with Legislative Decree No. 231/2001. We have adopted a “Code of Ethics” extended to
all companies controlled by the Itelyum Group, which includes provisions addressing compliance with anticorruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations and best practices. The core values set out in our Code of Ethics
include integrity, diversity, efficiency, responsibility and innovation. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have
adopted a 231/2001 Management and Organizational Model (Modello di Organizzazione e Gestione) aimed, inter
_alia, at preventing the possibility to commit specifically identified offences in the interest or for the benefit of the_
Itelyum Group. These companies have appointed an independent supervisory body, with the scope to supervise
the functioning and the adherence to the 231/2001 Management and Organizational Model and the related
internal procedures. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may incur liabilities for the
_actions of our directors, employees, agents, representatives and intermediaries.”_

_Data Protection_

We process personal data as part of our business. We have adopted internal procedures and structured our
operations to comply with the requirements imposed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“General Data Protection
**Regulation” or “GDPR”). We have taken and will continue to take action to ensure the constant implementation**
of the best practices for compliance with the applicable data protection laws and regulation. See also “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—More stringent regulations in the area of data privacy could adversely_
_affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to_
_Our Business—We are subject to risks associated with security breaches of or damage to our IT systems.”_

**Legal and Other Proceedings**

We are, and may continue to be from time to time, party to legal disputes, administrative and criminal
proceedings or audits within the scope of our business activities. Although the outcome with respect to such legal
disputes, administrative proceedings or audits cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the
ultimate resolution of these matters, or any current or potential future matters of which we are currently aware,
will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We note,
however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be difficult to predict and we offer no assurance in this
regard. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Potential liabilities, costs and reputational
_impacts from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations and prospects.”_

We have briefly summarized below two of these proceedings, which relate to health and safety related matters.

In particular, two criminal proceedings for, among other things, alleged culpable injuries pursuant to the
applicable Italian Criminal and health and safety law provisions, are currently pending against the former

153


-----

technical director (direttore tecnico) and sole director of Castiglia and a manager of Itelyum Regeneration. These
two proceedings relate to different accidents which resulted in serious personal injuries for one of our employees
(in respect of the proceeding against the manager of Castiglia) and for one employee of a third-party company
providing on-site services for us (in respect of the proceeding against the manager of Itelyum Regeneration).
These accidents were allegedly associated with the violation of applicable Italian workplace health and safety
regulations. No final and binding (i.e., non-appealable) decision has been issued as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum in relation to these proceedings.

The proceeding against the manager of Castiglia is pending against such individual in his role as former legal
representative of Castiglia and it was initiated by the relevant prosecutors as a result of an accident relating to an
employee of Castiglia, who suffered in 2017 serious personal injuries at the premises of certain customers of
Castiglia. Moreover, in June 2021, the abovementioned former legal representative of Castiglia was sentenced to
one and a half months of imprisonment after a final and binding (i.e., non-appealable) ruling issued against him
in his position as former legal representative of Castiglia by the Italian Supreme Court (corte di cassazione) for,
among other things, culpable injuries in relation to another accident occurred in 2014 to another employee of
Castiglia, who suffered serious personal injuries during operations carried out at Castiglia premises. Said former
legal representative of Castiglia is currently a manager of Castiglia but no longer has delegation of powers, nor
does he operate as a technical director (direttore tecnico) of Castiglia.

The proceeding against the manager of Itelyum Regeneration was initiated against such individual in his role as
supervisor of health and safety standards compliance for Itelyum Regeneration, and relates to an accident which
occurred in 2018 at a site managed by Viscolube S.r.l. (now Itelyum Regeneration). In particular, an employee of
a third-party company providing on-site services to Itelyum Regeneration was severely injured during certain oil
discharge operations.

In terms of potential consequences for the Group, while neither Castiglia nor Itelyum Regeneration is itself party
to any criminal proceeding in relation to these accidents as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, these
alleged violations may potentially lead to an assertion of criminal liability for Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration,
as applicable, under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001. If Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration were to be involved
in a proceeding under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, a potential conviction of either company could result in,
among other things, sanctions and penalties, civil and administrative fines, operational bans (including on a
precautionary basis) being imposed on it. Moreover, according to general principles of Italian administrative law,
the alleged health and safety violations and associated proceedings, besides needing to be mandatorily disclosed
to the relevant public tendering authorities in the context of the public tender procedures to which Castiglia and
Itelyum Regeneration take part pursuant to applicable Italian regulations, could also, irrespective of any potential
liability under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, result in the disqualification of Castiglia or Itelyum
Regeneration, as applicable, from future or ongoing tender processes for the awarding of contracts with public
entities (both upon a discretional assessment by the competent public contracting authority or upon a decision by
an administrative court following a claim by competitors of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, on
a case by case basis, and as a general and automatic effect), in particular in the event of a final and binding
conviction (i.e. non-appealable) of the manager of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable. In addition,
as well as the one that occurred in 2014 mentioned above in relation to which a final and binding conviction
verdict was issued in June 2021 against the former technical and sole director of Castiglia, these alleged
violations could potentially trigger the termination of certain ongoing contracts to which Castiglia or Itelyum
Regeneration, as applicable, is party with public entities, as well as the enforcement of any bid or performance
bond provided by Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration to the relevant public contracting entities, where applicable.
See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Potential liabilities, costs and reputational impacts
_from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations and prospects.”_

Although our potential ultimate legal and financial liabilities with respect to such proceedings cannot be
estimated with certainty, based on information available as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and taking
into account, among others, the following elements, we do not believe that the outcome of these legal
proceedings, individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position
or results of operations: (i) while health and safety legislation provisions could potentially trigger administrative
liability for us under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, none of
these criminal proceedings against individuals is accompanied by a proceeding against us under Legislative
Decree No. 231/2001; (ii) certain remediation actions to strengthen health and safety standards and related
compliance procedures have already been implemented by each of Castiglia and Itelyum Regeneration following
the accidents at issue and, in this respect, the applicable case law and statutory laws provide that any such

154


-----

internal measures aimed at minimizing the possibility of further health and safety violations may be taken into
account by the competent courts and authorities, thereby avoiding or mitigating potential sanctions, including any
applicable operational ban or exclusion (so called “Self-Cleaning Measures”); (iii) as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, neither Castiglia nor Itelyum Regeneration has suffered any material negative consequences
(including from a legal, business and reputational standpoint) as a result of the abovementioned accidents and the
related proceedings; (iv) Itelyum Regeneration does not have any material contracts with public contracting
authority following a public tender process, therefore potential disqualification or contract termination risks
appear to be remote and/or not applicable; and (v) as far as the proceeding against the manager of Castiglia is
concerned, we have obtained indemnification protections in the contractual documentation relating to the
acquisition of such business in July 2021.

**Insurance**

We continually monitor the risks associated with our activities and regularly verify and adjust our insurance
coverage accordingly. We have put in place, among others, the following insurance policies:

    - public, products and professional liability insurance covering liabilities resulting from but not limited
to professional misconduct, hidden errors, defects, omissions and negligence;

    - environmental liability insurance covering liabilities arising due to pollution that occurs in connection
with our activities;

    - civil responsibility and group accident insurance for certain employees covering insurance for
accidents that can occur in connection with the work conducted by our employees, including in relation
to the operation of our fleet of vehicles; and

    - property damage and business interruption insurance covering material damages and financial
consequential losses.

We believe that we have insurance coverage against most material risks that are typically insured by similar
companies with comparable risk exposure.

**REGULATION**

_This section sets forth a brief description of the more significant aspects of the regulations governing waste_
_collection, sorting, transportation, treatment and disposal, which have a significant effect on the business of the_
_Itelyum Group. While the following summary description contains the primary information concerning such_
_regulations that are considered material by us, it is not an exhaustive account of all applicable laws and_
_regulations. References and discussions to treaties, laws, regulations and other administrative and regulatory_
_documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such treaties, laws, regulations and other administrative and_
_regulatory documents themselves. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject_
_to an increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations, especially in regards to the environment.”_

**European Union Framework**

**_The Waste Framework Directive_**

The EU legislation relating to the protection of the environment, which is based on the key principle “polluter
pays,” is constantly evolving. Amongst the regulations set forth by EU institutions under an environmental
standpoint, waste management legislation is of paramount importance.

The waste management regulatory framework is currently governed by the directive 2008/98/EC (the “Waste
**Framework Directive”) which limits the production of waste, promotes reuse and recycling and ensures that**
waste is adequately treated. The Waste Framework Directive has been lastly modified by EU directive 2018/851.

The Waste Framework Directive was adopted on November 19, 2008, and entered into force on December 12,
2010, replacing the previous directive 2006/12/EC on waste and directives 75/439/EEC and 91/689/EEC on
waste oils and hazardous waste, respectively. The Waste Framework Directive sets forth the basic waste
management requirements for EU member States and establishes a hierarchy in the waste treatment, from
disposal prevention, through preparing for-reuse, recycling and recovery up to disposal (as last resort).

In addition to the Waste Framework Directive, there are specific regulations relating to peculiar waste deriving,
for instance, from batteries and accumulators, electric and electronic devices, end-of-life vehicles and products’
packaging. Furthermore, with the aim to reduce the use of single-use plastics, the EU directive 2019/904 has
been introduced.

In July 2014, the European Commission has published the so-called “waste package,” aimed at amending several
EU directives (i.e., four directives, all amended on May 30, 2018) and at introducing new waste targets, with the
focus on resource efficiency and circular economy.

The main elements of the “waste package” include, inter alia, at national levels: (i) the recycling and preparing
for reuse of municipal waste to be increased to 60% by 2030; (ii) the recycling and preparing for reuse of
packaging waste to be increased to 70% by the end of 2030. Such global 70% target shall include materialspecific targets (i.e., to reach 85% for paper and 55% for plastic, 80% for ferrous metals; 60% for aluminum and
75% for glass by the end of 2030 and other targets by the end of 2025); (iii) phasing out landfilling by 2035 for
recyclable (including plastic, paper, metals, glass and bio-waste) waste in non-hazardous waste landfills,
corresponding to a maximum landfilling rate of 25% or (iv) measures aimed at reducing food waste generation
by 50% by 2030.

EU member States are required to implement legislative measures in order to reinforce the waste treatment
hierarchy, by regulating, inter alia, the principles of:

    - waste management responsibility (i.e., waste producers are responsible for the disposal or treatment of
their own waste or for using a waste services provider authorized by the competent authorities to treat
their waste);

    - extended producer’s responsibility (e.g., producers recover products, collect waste arising from
selected products or accept returned products). The extended producer’s responsibility is mandatory for
end-of-life vehicles, batteries and electronic/electric waste and it will be mandatory for waste deriving
from packaging in 2025;

    - “polluter pays” (i.e., the costs of disposing of waste must be borne by the waste holder, by previous
holders or by the producers of the products originating the waste);

156


-----

    - self-sufficiency (i.e., EU member states shall create an adequate network of waste disposal installations
and recovery installations);

    - proximity (i.e., waste disposed/recovered in the nearest appropriate installations);

    - prevention promotion (i.e., EU member states shall promote the prevention of waste production
through the development of clean technologies as well as the reuse and recycling of materials).

**_Definition of waste_**

According to the Waste Framework Directive, waste is defined as “any substance or object, which the holder
_discards, or intends or is requested to discard.” The Waste Framework Directive also clarifies the distinction_
between waste and non-waste and introduces the process for how waste can become non-waste. Decision
2000/532/EC and Annex III of the Waste Framework Directive establish the classifications of waste, including
the distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous waste.

**_Batteries and accumulators - the Batteries Directive_**

The EU legislation on waste batteries is embodied in the directive 2006/66/EC (the “Batteries Directive”), as
subsequently amended, which intends to contribute to the protection, preservation and improvement of the
quality of the environment by minimizing the impact of batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and
accumulators. It also seeks to strengthen the environmental performance of the operators involved in the lifecycle of batteries and accumulators.

On December 10, 2020, the EU Commission proposed a new batteries regulation, aiming at ensuring that
batteries placed in the EU market are sustainable and safe throughout their entire life cycle.

**_End-of-life vehicles - the ELV Directive_**

The directive 2000/53/EC (the “ELV Directive”), as subsequently amended, sets out measures to prevent and
limit waste from end-of-life vehicles and their components, with the aim to ensure their reuse, recycling and
recovery as well as the improvement of the environmental performance of the relevant economic operators.

According to the ELV Directive, manufacturers must design and produce products which can be dismantled,
reused and recovered while importers and distributors must provide systems to collect ELVs and owners of ELVs
delivered for waste treatment must receive a certificate of destruction.

**_Packaging and packaging waste - the Packaging Directive_**

The packaging and packaging waste, at EU level, is governed by directive 94/62/EC (the “Packaging
**Directive”), as subsequently amended, which aims at harmonizing national measures relating to the management**
of packaging and relevant waste and at reducing the relevant impact on the environment by promoting the
prevention of the production of packaging waste and, in any case, the reuse, recycling or recovery thereof.

As above outlined, by end of 2025, EU countries should ensure that producer responsibility schemes are
established for all packaging.

**_Waste from electrical and electronic equipment - WEEE Directive_**

The EU regulation on waste from electrical and electronic equipment aims to contribute to sustainable production
and consumption. It addresses environmental and other issues caused by the growing number of discarded
electronics in the EU.

This type of waste contains a complex mixture of materials, some of which are hazardous and can therefore cause
environmental and health problems if the discarded devices are not properly managed. Accordingly, the directive
2012/19/EU (the “WEEE Directive”), as subsequently amended, aims at preventing the creation of WEEE and
contributing to the efficient use of resources and retrieving secondary raw materials through reuse. To do so, the
WEEE Directive requires the separate collection and proper treatment of WEEE and makes harder for exporters
to disguise their illegal shipments.

157


-----

**_Restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment - the RoHS Directive_**

Electric and electronic equipment contain hazardous substances which may result, in case of use, collection,
treatment or disposal of waste deriving from electrical and/or electronical devices, in major environmental and
health issues.

To address the risk of environmental/health problems, the EU directive 2011/65/EU (the “RoHS Directive”), as
subsequently amended, restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronical devices and
provides for safer alternatives. Furthermore, it also promotes the recyclability of electric and electronic
equipment and relevant components that have become waste, given that they contain fewer amounts of hazardous
substances.

**_REACH Regulation_**

The EU legislation governing the treatment and use of chemical substances consists of the REACH (Registration,
Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation 1907/2006/EC (the “REACH Regulation”).

The REACH Regulation has been adopted with the aim to improve the protection of human health and the
environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals, while enhancing the competitiveness of the EU
chemicals industry. To comply with the regulation, companies - which produce, import or somehow use
chemicals - must identify and manage the risks linked to the substances they manufacture and market in the EU;
they have to demonstrate to the competent EU authority (i.e., the European Chemicals Agency) how the
substance can be safely used, and must communicate the risk management measures to the users.

REACH establishes procedures for collecting and assessing information on the properties and hazards of
substances and it requires companies to register their substances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business—Maintaining compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to both our products and raw_
_materials could adversely affect our business.”_

**_EU ETS System_**

In order to face the production of greenhouse gas emissions, the European Union has established the “Emission
Trading System” (the “EU ETS System”), which aims at providing an efficient mechanism to reduce emissions.

The EU ETS System is governed by the directive 2003/87/EC, as subsequently amended, which provides for a
“cap and trade” system. Within the cap, installations which produce greenhouse gases buy or receive emissions
allowances, which they can trade with one another, as needed. Since the total number of allowances available is
limited, they have a value.

Companies operating within certain sectors (e.g., electricity and heat generation; commercial aviation) or using
certain gases (e.g., Carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide) have the obligation to participate in the EU ETS System.
However, companies operating in other sectors may participate in the EU ETS, under certain conditions.

**_Major accident hazards - the Seveso Directive_**

The directive 2012/18/EU, as subsequently amended (the “Seveso Directive”) has been enacted with the aim to
prevent major accidents at premises where hazardous substances are present in quantities exceeding certain
thresholds and to limit the consequences of accidents which may anyway occur.

Depending on the amount of hazardous substances present at the premises, the latter may be subject to highly
strict requirements.

Operators of facilities where hazardous substances are present, are subject to several obligations, relating to the
adoption of all the necessary measures to limit possible dangerous consequences for human health (e.g.,
notification of all concerned facilities; production of safety reports and implementation of major accidents
prevention policies).

Failure to comply with the provisions set forth by the above-represented EU regulatory framework, as
implemented by national legislation, may entail the application of monetary sanctions (up to € 150.0 thousand).

**Italian Environmental Regulatory Framework**

The Italian legal framework governing the Itelyum Group’s business is mainly set forth by Legislative Decree
no. 152 of April 3, 2006 (the “Environmental Code”) which governs, inter alia, the management of waste in
general and the granting of the permits for the opening and management of treatment plants.

**_The Environmental Code_**

(i) Waste - regulatory framework

In compliance with the principles set forth by the Waste Framework Directive, the Environmental Code promotes
the prevention of production of waste and defines the waste as “any substance or object that the holder discards
or intends or is required to discard” (reference is made to article 183, para. 1, let. a) of the Environmental Code).

Waste is classified, according to its origin, into municipal waste and special waste and, according to its
characteristics, into hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Additionally, following the latest amendments
(reference is made to Legislative Decree no. 116 of September 3, 2020) to the Environmental Code, waste can be
classified as “deriving from construction works,” food waste and organic waste. The legislation applicable to the
waste depends on said classifications.

Depending on the type of waste and on the activity carried out in connection with the waste, the Environmental
Code requires the producers or holders of waste to carry out the treatment of waste themselves or to have the
treatment and/or the collection and transportation handled by an authorized third party or arranged by a public
collector under a special agreement.

The waste produced is traced through an integrated system which provides for a national register where
information about the waste management - by means of registers relating to the operations of waste loading and
unloading and waste forms reporting the whole transportation of waste - is reported.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may fail to obtain, renew, or comply with the terms of
_the licenses, authorizations and permits required for our operations, and development or operation of our waste_
_management facilities may be slowed or interrupted due to administrative law and rules and conditions imposed_
_by local governments.”_

(ii) Waste treatment - operating permits

The implementation and management of plants for disposal or recovery of waste, including hazardous waste, is
subject to the obtainment of a single operating permit (Autorizzazione unica per i nuovi impianti di smaltimento e
_di recupero dei rifiuti), issued by the competent authority, where all the obligations and characteristics of the_
plants are listed. The single operating permit, for plants having certain characteristics requested by the
Environmental Code, may be substituted by the integrated environmental authorization (Autorizzazione Integrata
_Ambientale)._

Furthermore, in order to carry out the activities of collection, transportation and/or sale of waste, the enrolment
with the national register of waste managers (Albo nazionale gestori ambientali) is mandatory.

Pursuant to national legislation - implementing the WEEE, ELV and Batteries Directives - applicable to waste
from electrical and electronical equipment, end-of-life vehicles, batteries and accumulators, the treatment of such
special waste is subject to obtainment of the above-mentioned single permit.

(iii) Waste non-compliance – sanctions

Failure to comply with the legislation applicable to waste, both in relation to the treatment operations (e.g.,
collection, transportation, recovery and/or disposal) and in relation to the obligations to obtain the relevant
authorizations or to be enrolled with the specific registers/consortia, may entail the application of administrative
and/or criminal monetary sanctions (up to €45.0 thousand) or, in the worst-case scenario, other criminal sanctions
(imprisonment up to eight years).

(iv) Contamination events

The detection of potential polluting substances in environmental matrixes (i.e., soil and/or groundwater) entails
that the polluter adopts, in the following 24 hours, the necessary prevention measures and communicates the

159


-----

detected potential contamination to the competent authorities. The person responsible of the contamination, once
adopted the first prevention measures, has to carry out preliminary investigations on the polluting events and,
should the contamination thresholds provided for by applicable legislation be exceeded, has to start an
administrative procedure in front of the competent authorities which may consist of a remediation procedure (or
alternative measures ordered by the environmental authorities). Should the contamination be caused by
hazardous waste, criminal monetary sanctions (up to €52.0 thousand) or, in the worst-case scenario, other
criminal sanctions (imprisonment up to two years) would apply.

(v) National Consortium for the management, collection and treatment of Used Oils

In order to organize the management of used oils, which must be mandatorily regenerated, the companies which
produce oils (also following regeneration), collect and recover used oils or substitute and sell lubricants, must
enroll with the “National Consortium for the management, collection and treatment of Used Oils” (Consorzio
_nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e trattamento degli oli minerali usati, the “CONOU”)._

The CONOU aims - inter alia - at promoting public awareness of collection issues, ensuring and encourage
collection of used oils, directly carrying out collection of used oils from holders who request it, transferring the
used oils collected. The functions of the CONOU may be directly carried out by third parties operating in certain
sectors, specifically entitled, by virtue of a power of attorney granted by the CONOU, to do so.

The participation to the consortium entails the compliance with all the obligations deriving from the CONOU’s
regulation, including payment obligations in connection with the membership in the CONOU itself. Nonetheless,
the consortium has established an incentive mechanism, according to which CONOU’s members operating in the
regeneration industry are granted a regeneration treatment fee for the regeneration of waste oils.

(vi) National consortium for the collection and treatment of spent lead batteries and lead waste

The national consortium for the collection and treatment of spent lead batteries and lead waste (Consorzio
_Nazionale per la raccolta dei rifiuti di pile e batterie, the “COBAT”) is a collection and treatment system for_
spent lead batteries and lead waste.

COBAT grants an efficient service or the collection, storage and start-up for recycling of any type of waste and
offers companies a wide range of services that enhance and support their choice to be protagonists of the circular
economy.

The participation to the consortium entails the compliance with all the obligations deriving from the COBAT’s
regulation, including payment obligations in connection with the membership in the COBAT itself.

**_Asbestos legislation_**

The removal and/or remediation of asbestos-containing materials (“ACM”) is regulated, under an environmental
standpoint, by law March 27, 1992, no. 257 (the “Asbestos Law”) according to which owners and/or employers
operating facilities where ACM have been detected have the obligation to remove, encapsulate or remediate said
ACM, should their conditions be sufficiently friable to endanger human health. Pursuant to Italian laws and
regulations, the presence of ACMs in a building does not result, per se, in a duty to carry out remediation
activities. If ACMs have been detected on site, an asbestos inventory shall be conducted in order to map the
ACMs and inspections and maintenance plans shall be prepared periodically, which may also include the
removal of ACMs.

If, following the asbestos inventory, it results that ACMs are deteriorating or in poor condition with consequent
risk for release of fibers, the owner of the property shall prevent further deterioration and promptly adopt certain
remediation activities, i.e. either securing and encapsulating the ACMs present at the property, or removing them
and providing for the disposal of such ACMs by specialized and authorized operators. Once such operators are
appointed, a removal plan shall be submitted to the ATS at least 30 days before starting the remediation
activities.

Failure to comply with applicable legislation may entail the application of administrative monetary sanctions (up to
approximately €25 thousand) and, for the employers, of criminal sanctions (i.e., imprisonment up to six months).

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco. The ultimate controlling party of the Issuer is Verde
Holdings S.C.A., an entity whose controlling shareholder is Itelyum Co-investment LP, whose ultimate general
partner is Bay Fox Verde GP Limited.

On the Completion Date, (i) the Issuer will become the direct owner of 100% of the entire issued and outstanding
share capital of the Target, (ii) SSCP Fund IV and other SSCP co-investors will indirectly control the Target
Group through Itelyum Co-investment LP, which will indirectly own 64% of the share capital of the Target and
(iii) certain minority investors, comprised of DBAG and the Management Investors will indirectly own
approximately 29% and 7%, respectively, of the share capital of the Target.

Itelyum Co-investment LP and DBAG Diamante Investment S.à r.l. have entered into an investment and
shareholder agreement (the “Shareholder Agreement”), which will govern, inter alia:

    - the management and administration of the affairs of the Itelyum Group;

    - reserved matters which require the consent of certain shareholders, including changing the nature of the
business of the Itelyum Group and making material acquisitions and/or disposals of assets;

    - certain matters relating to potential exits and transfer restrictions in respect of shares held by each
shareholder, including the provision of certain pre-emptive, tag-along and drag-along rights.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The interests of our principal
_shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes.”_

In addition, Itelyum Co-investment LP and the senior management team of the Itelyum Group (the “Key
**Managers”) have entered into separate investment agreements (collectively, the “Managers Investment**
**Agreements”), pursuant to which such Key Managers have agreed to invest in the Itelyum Group.**

It is expected that, prior to the Completion Date, other members of the senior management of the Itelyum Group
selected by Itelyum Co-investment LP (the “Other Managers” and, together with the Key Managers,
collectively, the “Management Investors”), will invest in the Itelyum Group by entering into separate
investment agreements with Itelyum Co-Investment LP (such agreements, together with the Managers
Investment Agreements, collectively, the “Management Agreements”).

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we may from time to time enter into agreements with or render
services to related parties. In turn, such related parties may render services or deliver goods to us as part of their
business. Purchase and supply agreements between subsidiaries and affiliated companies and with associated
companies or shareholders of such associated companies are entered into from time to time within the ordinary
course of business.

We believe that all transactions with affiliated companies are negotiated and conducted on a basis equivalent to
those that would have been achievable on an arm’s-length basis at market conditions. Our affiliate transactions
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 primarily consisted of intercompany loans for de minimis
amounts.

The Itelyum Group has not otherwise been party to any transactions with related companies that warrant
disclosure.

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, our principal shareholders, including the Management Investors
have entered (or will enter) into the Shareholder Agreement and the Management Agreements, as further
described under “Principal Shareholders.”

amount of 50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), made available to the Issuer as original borrower.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Issuer (and certain restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer who
accede as additional borrowers) in euro and U.S. dollars and any other currency approved by the lenders under

166


-----

the Revolving Credit Facility, by the drawing of cash advances, the issuance of letters of credit and by way of
ancillary facilities (on a bilateral and fronted basis). Subject to certain exceptions and conditions, amounts under
the Revolving Credit Facility that have been repaid or prepaid may be re-borrowed. The Revolving Credit
Facility may be used towards financing or refinancing, directly or indirectly (a) all amounts payable in
connection with the Acquisition other than any payment of the purchase price made on the Closing Date, (b) the
refinancing, discharge and/or acquisition of existing indebtedness of the Target Group and paying any breakage

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement until the
date which is one month prior to the maturity date applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition, the Issuer may elect to request additional facilities either as a new additional or existing commitment
or facility or as an additional tranche or class of, or an increase of, or an extension of an existing facility under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Additional Facility Commitments”) provided that the aggregate
principal amount of total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (including the Additional
Facility Commitments) does not exceed the amount permitted to be incurred under clause (1) of the covenant
described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” below. The Issuer and the lenders may agree to certain terms_
in relation to the Additional Facility Commitments, including the margin, the termination date and the
availability period (each subject to parameters as set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). There are
certain limitations on the ability to incur Additional Facility Commitments.

**_Maturity and repayment requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling 54 months after the Closing Date.

Each advance of the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto,
subject to an ability to rollover cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must
be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

The termination date for a facility under an Additional Facility Commitment is the date agreed between the
Issuer and the relevant lenders, and must fall on or after the original termination date for the Revolving Credit
Facility as at the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, unless the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility are offered the opportunity by the Issuer to amend the original termination date for the Revolving Credit
Facility to a date on or prior to that of the relevant additional facility provided that (i) each lender under the
Revolving Credit Facility will be deemed to have declined any such offer and consented to the proposed
termination date of the relevant additional facility unless 50.1 per cent. of the lenders by commitment under the
Revolving Credit Facility notify the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility that they (A) accept such offer or
(B) reject such offer and do not consent to the termination date of the relevant additional facility, in each case by
11 a.m. 7 business days after the date of such offer, and (ii) no such offer shall be required if the Additional
Facility Commitments with an earlier termination date do not exceed the greater of €12.5 million (or its
equivalent in other currencies) and 15 per cent. of consolidated EBITDA.

**_Interest and fees_**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at rates per
annum initially equal to 3.50 per cent. plus EURIBOR or LIBOR, as applicable, and provided that no insolvency,
payment (insofar as it relates to the payment of principal and/or interest and/or fees) or breach of other
obligations (insofar as it relates to failure to deliver a compliance certificate such that the margin cannot be
determined) event of default has occurred or is continuing, will be subject to margin ratchet step downs based on
the Group’s senior secured net leverage ratio starting from the date falling 6 months after the Closing Date, as set
out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

If EURIBOR, or where applicable LIBOR, is less than zero, EURIBOR or LIBOR (as applicable) shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility.

167


-----

LIBOR for loans in USD will be able to be replaced with risk free rates by the Issuer prior to 30 June 2023.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility from (and including) the Closing Date to (and including) the last day of the availability period for the
Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is equal to 30.00 per cent. of the margin applicable at that time,
and is payable quarterly in arrear, on the last day of the availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and
on the date on which a lender’s commitment is cancelled.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1 per cent. on the overdue amount, although unpaid default
interest may only be compounded to the extent permitted under any applicable laws, including, but not limited to,
the Italian Civil Code and/or the Italian Banking Law.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the Agent and the Security Agent in connection with
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement, arrangement fees to the arrangers,
and fronting fees to the issuing bank under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and letter of credit fees to
the lenders in an amount equal to the margin of the Revolving Credit Facility with respect to an issuance of a
letter of credit.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The original borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is the Issuer but the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement includes a mechanism to enable any of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries in Italy, the same
jurisdiction as an existing borrower, any borrower jurisdiction contemplated in the tax structure memorandum or
otherwise with the consent of all of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, to accede as an additional
borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain conditions.

At the Closing Date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by the Issuer.

If any of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries is or becomes a material subsidiary under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Issuer shall procure (or, if the Merger Date has not occurred, use commercially reasonable efforts to
procure) that such material subsidiary shall, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to any agreed limitation
language, become a guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and shall accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement, no later than (i) the earlier of (x) 90 days following the Merger Date and (y) 90 days after the date
falling 15 months following the Closing Date and (ii) the date falling 90 days after the latest due date on which the
annual financial statements are required to be delivered to the agent in respect of each subsequent financial year (the
Issuer together with any members of the Group that accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional
guarantors being the “Guarantors”). The Issuer shall also procure (or, if the Merger Date has not occurred, use
commercially reasonably efforts to procure) that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, tested annually by
reference to the original financial statements and then the relevant annual financial statements of the Issuer (or, at
the Issuer’s option, any more recent available financial information which is provided to the Agent), the aggregate
of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same basis as consolidated
EBITDA is calculated under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) of the Guarantors (calculated on an
unconsolidated basis and excluding the contribution of any on-balance sheet joint ventures) is not less than 80 per
cent. of consolidated EBITDA of wholly-owned members of the Group incorporated in a guarantor jurisdiction (the
“Guarantor Coverage”) (subject to certain exceptions).

**_Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility (subject to certain agreed security principles set out in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) is secured as further described in the section entitled “Description of Notes—Security.”

**_Representations and warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, subject to
certain agreed customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets as
applicable (with certain representations and warranties being repeated on the date of each utilization, on the first
day of each interest period and at certain other times), including: (i) status and due incorporation; (ii) power and
authority; (iii) legal, valid and binding documentation; (iv) no conflict; (v) validity and admissibility in evidence;
(vi) governing law and enforcement; (vii) no filing or stamp taxes; (viii) taxation; (ix) the accuracy of financial
statements; (x) no litigation; (xi) legal and beneficial ownership; (xii) sanctions and anti-money laundering; and
(xiii) base case model.

**_Undertakings and covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants, information undertakings
and related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes, including: (i) limitation
on indebtedness; (ii) limitation on restricted payments; (iii) limitation on liens; (iv) restrictions on distributions
from restricted subsidiaries; (v) limitations on sale of assets and subsidiary stock; (vi) limitation on affiliate
transactions; (vii) merger and consolidation; (viii) suspension of covenants on achievement of investment grade
status; (ix) impairment of security interests; (x) additional intercreditor agreements; and (xi) IPO debt pushdown.
In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains certain additional affirmative and negative
covenants and a financial covenant. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which are
subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets (as
applicable).

_Additional covenants_

The additional covenants include, among others: (i) provision of a compliance certificate with each set of the
Issuer’s annual audited and quarterly financial statements (commencing not earlier than the quarter date falling at
the end of the first complete quarter after the Closing Date); (ii) maintenance of the Guarantor Coverage;
(iii) authorizations; (iv) compliance with laws; (v) pari passu ranking; (vi) further assurance; (vii) sanctions, anticorruption and anti-money laundering; (viii) no change of “centre of main interest”; (ix) taxes; and
(x) conditions subsequent.

_Financial covenant_

If at 5.00 p.m. on a testing date (being each quarter date, commencing on the quarter date falling at the end of the
third complete quarter after the Closing Date) the aggregate principal amount of all loans under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and any additional facility that is specified to benefit from the financial covenant (in
each case excluding (i) any utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees), (ii) ancillary facilities,
and (iii) any loans drawn to fund any fees and/or original issue discount or other fees, costs and expenses in
connection with the Transaction) on such testing date less any cash and cash equivalents exceeds 40 per cent. of
the aggregate of (A) the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as at the date of the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and (B) the aggregate of all Additional Facility Commitments established after the
date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (disregarding, in each case, any reduction of commitments
following the establishment thereof) (the “Test Condition”), the senior secured net leverage ratio in respect of
the relevant period will not exceed 7.94 to 1.0 (the “Financial Covenant”). The Financial Covenant, if breached,
will trigger an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the Issuer to cure or prevent
an event of default at any time if the Group has received one or more shareholder injections by way of
shareholder loan and/or equity and the Issuer has elected that all or any part of any amounts so received shall, at
the option of the Issuer, either (i) increase the consolidated EBITDA or (ii) decrease senior secured indebtedness,
in each case under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The equity cure right may not be exercised on more
than five occasions during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and may not be utilized in
consecutive quarters and no more than twice in any four consecutive quarters. The Issuer can also cure or prevent
an event of default by electing to recalculate (i) the senior secured net leverage ratio for any relevant period for
which the Issuer has sufficient available information to effect such recalculation and/or (ii) the Test Condition on
any subsequent date notwithstanding that such date is not a test date (including to give effect to any reduction in
the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding, any reduction in senior secured indebtedness and/or any
increase in cash and/or cash equivalents).

**_Prepayments_**

Upon a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, each lender under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement shall be entitled to cancel its commitments and require repayment of all of its share of
the utilizations and payment of all amounts owing to it under the finance documents provided that the relevant
lender gives notice to the agent within 30 days of the Issuer notifying the agent of the change of control.

A borrower may voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, without penalty or
premium, at any time in whole or in part, subject to agreed minimum amounts and multiples, on not less than one
business day’s notice to the agent, provided that the Revolving Credit Facility shall only be able to be prepaid in
full from the date falling 18 months and 2 days after the Closing Date.

169


-----

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for events of default, the occurrence and continuance of
which would allow, unless otherwise indicated below, subject to certain exceptions, 66 2/3 per cent. of the
lenders by commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility to (among other things) accelerate all outstanding
loans and terminate their commitments, including (subject in certain cases to customary materiality, actual
knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate). The Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement provides for the following events of default: (i) misrepresentations; (ii) breach of the
Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) unlawfulness, invalidity and repudiation of finance documents; (iv) non-payment
of amounts due under the finance documents; (v) non-compliance with other obligations under the finance
documents; (vi) cross payment default and cross acceleration; (vii) final judgment default; and (viii) insolvency
and insolvency proceedings.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with
it are governed by, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, English law although the restrictive covenants,
the information undertakings and the events of default, which are scheduled to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with such schedules, shall be
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of the relevant creditor groups, amongst others, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “RCF Lenders”), each obligor in respect of the
Revolving Credit Facility (collectively, the “Obligors”), the Third Party Security Providers, the Security Agent,
the Trustee, and the Subordinated Creditors (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) will enter into
an intercreditor agreement prior to the Issue Date (the “Intercreditor Agreement”). The following description is
a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the
rights and obligations of the holders of the Notes. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety.
As such, you are urged to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the description that follows,
defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes. Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor
Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indentures and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. Capitalized terms used below
shall have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement unless otherwise defined.

**_Overview_**

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

 - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Group (as defined below);

 - the relative ranking of certain security granted by certain members of the Group;

 - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Group;

 - when enforcement action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) can be taken in respect of the Transaction Security (as defined below);

 - provisions relating to the making of any acceleration or demand for payment in respect of the Notes;

 - the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

 - the requirement to turn over amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security;

 - when the Transaction Security and any guarantee(s) issued by certain Obligors and Third Party Security
Providers will be released to permit an enforcement sale;

 - the circumstances in which creditors’ claims (including noteholders’ claims against the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and/or Future Senior Issuer) might be required to be transferred to third parties or released to
assist in enforcement; and

 - the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security and other amounts
received by the Security Agent.

170


-----

**_Parties_**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the principal parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will be: (i) Verde Midco
S.r.l. in the capacity of Topco and Original Shareholder Creditor, (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in such
capacity and certain other capacities), (iii) the agent for the finance parties under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (the “RCF Agent”), (iv) the RCF Lenders, (v) the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and (vi) the Security
Agent.

The “Super Senior Creditors” include the RCF Lenders and the RCF Agent together with, upon accession, the
Super Senior Hedging Lenders (as defined below). The “Senior Secured Creditors” include the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee together with, upon accession, the Pari Passu Hedging
Lenders (as defined below), the Future Pari Passu Creditors (as defined below) and the Cash Management
Facility Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). The “Senior Creditors” include, upon accession,
the Future Senior Creditors (as defined below).

The Intercreditor Agreement therefore allows for accession by certain future creditors in order to share (to the
extent set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) in the relevant security, including (i) hedge counterparties pursuant
hedging agreements which are secured on a super senior basis with (among other liabilities) the Revolving Credit
Facility (the “Super Senior Hedging Agreements” and the providers thereof the “Super Senior Hedging
**Lenders”), (ii) hedge counterparties pursuant to hedging agreements which are secured on a pari passu basis**
with (among other liabilities) the Senior Secured Notes (the “Pari Passu Hedging Agreements” and the
providers thereof, the “Pari Passu Hedging Lenders” and together with the Super Senior Hedging Lenders, the
“Hedging Counterparties”), (iii) creditors of future loan or bond indebtedness of the Obligors (which is
permitted by or not restricted under the terms of the Credit Facility Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Senior Secured Notes, and which is not subordinated in right of payment to the liabilities
owed to the Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors) (the “Future Pari Passu Debt”), including
any senior secured notes issued after the Issue Date pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (the “Future
**_Pari Passu Creditors”), (iv) creditors of future loan or bond indebtedness of the Obligors (which is permitted by_**
or not restricted under the terms of the Credit Facility Documents and the Senior Secured Notes, and which is
_pari passu with, and not subordinated in right of payment to, the liabilities owed to the Senior Creditors)_
(“Future Senior Debt”), (the “Future Senior Creditors”) and (v) creditors of future loan or bond indebtedness
of the Obligors (which is permitted by or not restricted under the terms of the Credit Facility Documents and the
Senior Secured Notes, and which is not subordinated in right of payment to the liabilities owed to the Super
Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors but is secured on the Transaction Security on a second ranking
basis (“Future Second Lien Debt” and the providers thereof, the “Future Second Lien Creditors”).

No Restricted Subsidiary (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (each a member of the “Group”) nor any shareholder of a member of the Group which, in each case, is not
otherwise party to (1) a document creating security in favor of the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured
Creditors or the Senior Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured, will be party to the Intercreditor
Agreement save for (i) any shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of any existing or future
loan made to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any other member of the Group (each a “Shareholder
**Creditor”) (the Intercreditor Agreement contains customary subordination provisions and restrictions relating to**
the receivables owing from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any member of the Group to any Shareholder
Creditor (the “Shareholder Liabilities”)) and (ii) certain members of the Group that lend to another member of
the Group (each an “Intragroup Lender”) that will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the
loans or indebtedness owing from such members of the Group to such Intra-Group Lenders in respect of intragroup loans (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Agreement contains subordination provisions
relating to any Intra-Group Liabilities. However, members of the Group will not be prohibited from incurring,
amending or making payments in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities until an acceleration event under the
Credit Facility Documents or the Indentures is continuing and at any time prior to such acceleration event, such
Intra-Group Liabilities may be converted into equity (subject to certain security being granted where required).

**_Ranking and priority_**

_Priority of indebtedness_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Obligors shall rank in right and priority of
payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(a) _first, the liabilities owed to the Security Agent, the liabilities owed to the Super Senior Creditors (the_
“Super Senior Liabilities”), the liabilities owed to the Senior Secured Creditors including with respect to

Counterparty (to the extent not already included in the Super Senior Liabilities), the liabilities owed to the
Cash Management Facility Creditors (the “Cash Management Facility Liabilities”), the liabilities owed to
any Future Second Lien Creditors (the “Future Second Lien Liabilities”), the Future Pari Passu Debt, the
Future Senior Debt of any future issuer of senior debt to the Future Senior Creditors (the “Future Senior
**Issuer Liabilities”), and certain customary costs and expenses of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (the**
“Trustee Liabilities”) pari passu and without any preference between them;

(b) _second, any guarantee liabilities owed to any Future Senior Creditor pari passu and without any preference_
between them;

(c) _third, the Intra-Group Liabilities and any liabilities owed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any of its_
subsidiaries to any Future Senior Issuer pari passu and without any preference between them; and

(d) _fourth, the Shareholder Liabilities._

The Intercreditor Agreement contains an acknowledgment by all parties thereto that the Future Senior Issuer
Liabilities are senior obligations of the relevant issuer, and provides that nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement
shall impair the right of the Senior Creditors to institute suit for the recovery of any payment due by such an
issuer in respect of the Future Senior Issuer Liabilities (as applicable), but provided that the Senior Creditors
shall not, until the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), take any
steps to appropriate the assets of such an issuer subject to the Transaction Security in connection with any
Enforcement Action other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Priority of security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security provided for the liabilities described in paragraphs (a) to
(c) below (the “Transaction Security”) shall rank and secure these liabilities in the following order (and subject
to the proceeds of such security being distributed in accordance with the Payments Waterfall defined below):

(a) first, the liabilities owed to the Security Agent, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities,
the liabilities owed to any Hedging Counterparty (to the extent not already included in the Super Senior
Liabilities), the Cash Management Facility Liabilities, the Future Pari Passu Debt and the Trustee
Liabilities, pari passu and without any preference between them (but only to the extent that such
Transaction Security is expressed to secured those liabilities);

(b) second, the Future Second Lien Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them (but only to
the extent that such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities); and

(c) third, the Future Senior Debt pari passu and without any preference between them (but only to the extent
that such Transaction Security is Shared Security (which term shall include, for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, certain other security as may be granted in future and designated by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer as “Shared Security”)).

The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that any security provided for the Future Senior Debt only (the
“Senior Notes Only Security”) shall rank and secure the Future Senior Debt, pari passu and without any
preference between them (but only to the extent that such Senior Notes Only Security is expressed to secure such
liabilities).

The Shareholder Liabilities, the Holdco Liabilities and the Intra-Group Liabilities (the “Subordinated
**Liabilities”) shall not be secured by the Transaction Security or the Senior Notes Only Security.**

If security is to be granted for certain future indebtedness (including Credit Facility Lender Liabilities (other than
with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility) (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Cash Management
Facility Liabilities, Future Pari Passu Debt, Future Second Lien Debt and Future Senior Debt) (“Future Debt”),
to the extent such Future Debt cannot be secured with the agreed ranking without the existing security first being
released, the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions that such Future Debt will (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional security documents securing the same assets
subject to the relevant security on a second or lesser-ranking basis and such Future Debt will nonetheless be
deemed and treated for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu
with corresponding liabilities which would otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated above and any
amounts to be applied towards such Future Debt shall be applied accordingly. In the event that it is not possible
to permit the recreation of additional security documents as referred to above, no amendments or release and

172


-----

retaking of security under the existing security documents shall be permitted without the consent of the required
creditors under the documents thereby secured unless permitted by such documents (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the retaking of any such security as required by the relevant secured document).

**_Payments and prepayments; subordination of Future Second Lien Debt_**

Prior to the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities, no Debtor and Third Party Security Provider may make
payments in respect of the Future Second Lien Liabilities without the consent of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as
that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) except as described in the foregoing paragraph or as
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement including the following:

Debt Document or (2) is paid on or after the final maturity of the Future Second Lien Liabilities; or

(ii) any other amount in respect of the Future Second Lien Liabilities which is not an amount of principal
or capitalized interest accrued due and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the Future
Second Lien Debt Documents (such other amounts including all additional amounts payable as a result
of the tax gross up provisions relating to the Future Second Lien Liabilities and amounts in respect of
currency indemnities in the relevant Future Second Lien Debt Documents);

(b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking payments in respect
of the Future Second Lien Debt (a “Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice”) is
outstanding; and

(c) no Senior Secured Debt Payment Default (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has
occurred and is continuing; or

(2) if the payment is pursuant to provisions contained in a Future Second Lien Debt Document that are
comparable to the following provisions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and no acceleration
event under the Senior Secured Debt Documents has occurred): (a) illegality, (b) right of cancellation and
repayment in relation to a single lender or issuing bank, (c) change of control and (d) replacement of a
lender;

(5) (for so long as a Future Second Lien Event of Default is continuing), if the payment is in respect of
commercially reasonable work fees and professional fees, costs and expenses for restructuring advice and
valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring
advisers) incurred by the Future Second Lien Debt Representative not covered by paragraph (3) above in an
aggregate amount to all such Future Second Lien Debt Representatives under this paragraph not exceeding
€5.0 (or its equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate until the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities;

(6) payments of amounts equal to any payment accrued pursuant to the Future Second Lien Debt immediately
after the period during which any Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice is outstanding or a
Senior Secured Debt Payment Default or a Future Second Lien Debt Payment Default ceases to be
continuing and which would otherwise have been a permitted payment pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) for so long as a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default is continuing certain payments as a result of the
Future Second Lien Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged in exchange for the issuance of shares
in any holding company of the Future Senior Issuer, subject to certain conditions;

(8) costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the
Future Second Lien Debt documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the
Future Second Lien Debt documents), subject to certain conditions;

(9) costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to)
any refinancing of the Future Second Lien Debt in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit
Facility Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Cash Management Facility Documents and any
Future Pari Passu Debt document;

(10) payments of certain reasonable and customary consent fees in connection with amendments to the Future
Second Lien Debt documents in proportion to any corresponding amounts paid in respect of the Super
Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities (to the extent such fees are paid or payable);

Credit Facility Documents, Cash Management Facility Documents, Senior Secured Notes documents and
Future Pari Passu Debt documents; or

(12) payment of any other amount not exceeding €2.5 million (or its equivalent) in aggregate in any financial
year of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried
forward and utilized in the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have been used first).

If an event of default (other than a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default) under the finance documents in respect
of the Senior Secured Liabilities (each a “Senior Secured Default”) has occurred and is continuing and the
Future Second Lien Debt Representative has received a Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice from
either the Credit Facility Agent, the Cash Management Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the
representative of the Future Pari Passu Debt, all payments in respect of the Future Second Lien Liabilities (other
than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and
those permitted by paragraph (2)(a), (3) and (5) above) are suspended until the earliest of:

(a) the date on which there is a waiver, remedy or cure of such Senior Secured Default in accordance with the
relevant finance documents;

(b) 120 days after the receipt by the Future Second Lien Debt Representative of the Future Second Lien Debt
Payment Blockage Notice;

(c) the repayment and discharge of all obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities;

(d) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Future Second Lien Debt Payment
Blockage Notice (and, if at such time a Senior Secured Default is continuing in relation to the Senior
Secured Liabilities (other than the Senior Secured Liabilities in respect of which the notice was given), the
Relevant Representative(s) in respect of those other Senior Secured Liabilities notify/ies (amongst others)
the Future Second Lien Debt Representative that the Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice is
cancelled;

(e) the date on which the Security Agent or Future Second Lien Debt Representative takes any Enforcement
Action against a member of the Group which it is permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(f) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Default is no longer continuing and if the relevant Senior
Secured Liabilities have been accelerated such acceleration has been rescinded (and if such acceleration
consisted solely of declaring the relevant debt payable on demand, such rescission can be effected by the
relevant majority creditors in respect of the relevant debt);

(g) provided no Senior Secured Debt Payment Default is continuing, the original scheduled maturity date of the
Future Second Lien Debt issued in the form of notes (provided that such maturity date is a date not earlier
than the later of the original maturity date of the Senior Secured Notes and the Termination Date (as defined
in the Credit Facility Documents) at the time of issuance of such Future Second Lien Debt); and

(h) if a Future Second Lien Debt Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at anytime after delivery of a
Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice, the date on which the Future Second Lien Debt
Standstill Period expires.

No new Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Future Second Lien Debt
Relevant Representative in respect of a Future Second Lien Debt Default unless 360 days have elapsed since the
immediately prior Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice. No Future Second Lien Debt Payment
Blockage Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default more than 60 days after the
date that the Relevant Representative received notice of that Senior Secured Default. No Relevant Representative
may serve more than one Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice with respect to the same event or
set of circumstances, and no Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice may be served in respect of a
Senior Secured Debt Payment Default notified to a Relevant Representative at the time at which an earlier Future
Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice was issued.

174


-----

If a Future Second Lien Debt Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be)
Senior Secured Debt Payment Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the relevant creditors/
creditor’s representative or remedied) the relevant debtor may then make those payments it would have otherwise
been entitled to pay under the Future Second Lien Debt and if it does so promptly any event of default under the
Future Second Lien Debt caused by such delayed payment shall be waived and any enforcement notice which
may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived. A Future Second Lien Debt Payment
Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then due.

**_Payments and prepayments-Obligors and Third Party Security Providers_**

The Obligors and the Third Party Security Providers may make payments and prepayments in respect of the
Credit Facility Documents, the Super Senior Hedging Agreements, the Pari Passu Hedging Agreements, and the
Senior Secured Notes at any time in accordance with their terms and may prepay or acquire the Senior Secured
Notes.

**_Payments and prepayments; subordination of the Future Senior Debt_**

Any Future Senior Issuer may make payments and prepayments in respect of the Future Senior Issuer Liabilities
(including by prepaying or acquiring Future Senior Debt) at any time in accordance with the terms of the Future
Senior Debt Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement provided that such payment is not made from assets
subject to Transaction Security and not financed by a payment from a member of the Group that was prohibited
at such time by any of the Debt Documents.

result of the tax gross up provisions relating to the Future Senior Liabilities and amounts in respect of
currency indemnities in the relevant Future Senior Debt Documents or Holdco Debt Documents);

Intercreditor Agreement;

year of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried
forward and utilized in the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have been used first).

Until the later of the discharge of all the Senior Secured Debt and the Future Second Lien Debt, if a Senior
Secured Debt Payment Default has occurred and is continuing or a Future Second Lien Payment Default has
occurred and is continuing, all payments in respect of the Future Senior Debt Liabilities (other than those
consented to by the Majority Super Senior Creditors. the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority
Future Second Lien Creditors and certain amounts due to any Future Senior Debt Representative for its own
account) will be suspended.

In addition, if either (x) a Senior Secured Default has occurred and is continuing and any Future Senior Debt
Representative has received a Future Senior Debt Payment Blockage Notice from either the Credit Facility
Agent, the Cash Management Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the representative of the

Lien Creditors and certain amounts due to the Future Senior Debt Representative for its own account and those

effected by the relevant majority creditors in respect of the relevant debt); or

(g) if a Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at anytime after delivery of a Future Senior Debt
Payment Blockage Notice, the date on which the Standstill Period expires,

_provided that none of the circumstances described in this paragraph, nor those described in the paragraph above_
shall prevent the Future Senior Issuer from making payments in respect of the Future Senior Issuer Liabilities in
accordance with the terms of the relevant documentation from its own assets (excluding at all times any assets
which are subject to Transaction Security) provided that such payment is not financed by a payment to the Future
Senior Issuer from a member of the Group that was prohibited by the Senior Secured Debt Documents and the
Future Second Lien Debt Documents.

No new Future Senior Debt Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative in respect of
a Senior Secured Debt Event of Default unless 360 days have elapsed since the immediately prior Future Senior
Debt Payment Blockage Notice. No Future Senior Debt Payment Blockage Notice may be served in respect of a
Senior Secured Debt Event of Default or a Future Second Lien Debt Event of Default more than 60 days after the

promptly any event of default under the Future Senior Debt Documents caused by such delayed payment shall be
waived and any enforcement notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be
waived. A Senior Secured Debt Payment Default and/or Future Second Lien Debt Payment Default is remedied

_Restrictions on enforcement by the Future Second Lien Creditors; Future Second Lien Debt Standstill_

Until the discharge of all the Senior Secured Liabilities, no Future Second Lien Creditor may take Enforcement
Action with respect to the Future Second Lien Debt, except that such restriction will not apply in relation to any
Future Second Lien Liabilities if:

(b) the Credit Facility Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities have received notice
of the specified event of default from the Future Second Lien Debt Representative;

**Lien Debt Standstill Date”) that the Future Second Lien Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice on**
the Credit Facility Agent, the Cash Management Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the

(a) the date falling (i) 90 days in the case of a non-payment of interest, principal or fees representing the Future
Second Lien Liabilities, (ii) 120 days in the case of a failure to make a payment of any other amount
representing the Future Second Lien Liabilities, and (iii) 150 days in the case of any other Future Second
Lien Debt Event of Default, in each case after the Future Second Lien Debt Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action (including the enforcement of any
Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that
the Future Second Lien Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action against the same entity as is
taken by the Security Agent and may not take any other action against any other member of the Group;

177


-----

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any Debtor owning Future Second Lien
Liabilities against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) in respect of Future Second Lien Debt issued in the form of notes, the date on which a Future Second Lien
Debt Event of Default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future
Second Lien Debt; and

(e) the expiration of any other Future Second Lien Debt Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that
the current Future Second Lien Debt Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or
permitted remedy thereof).

If the Security Agent has notified the Future Second Lien Debt Representative that it is enforcing Transaction
Security, no Future Second Lien Creditor may take any enforcement action against that Debtor, Third Party
Security Provider, or any subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider (as the case may be) while
the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Transaction Security where such action might be reasonably
likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom. If the Future
Second Lien Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require the enforcement of such
Transaction Security, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of the relevant Security by way of a
sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Restrictions on enforcement by the Future Senior Creditors; Future Senior Debt Standstill_

Until the later of the discharge of all the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Future Second Lien Liabilities,
neither any Future Senior Debt Representative nor the holders of any Future Senior Liabilities may take
Enforcement Action (including a Senior Only Distressed Disposal) with respect to the Future Senior Liabilities
(including any action against the Future Senior Issuer or the guarantors of any Future Senior Liabilities (if any))
or direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any relevant Transaction Security
or Senior Notes Only Security document without the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group (as
defined below), except that such restriction will not apply in relation to:

(1) any Future Senior Debt Guarantee Liabilities and Shared Security if:

(a) an event of default under the Future Senior Debt Documents is continuing;

(b) the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Future Second
Lien Debt Representatives, have received notice of the specified event of default from any Future
Senior Debt Representative (as the case may be);

(c) a Future Senior Debt Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Future Senior Debt Standstill Period; and

(2) any Future Senior Issuer Liabilities and/or the Senior Notes Only Security if:

(a) an event of default under the Future Senior Debt Documents is continuing;

(b) the RCF Agent and the other representatives of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Future Second
Lien Debt Representatives, have received notice of the specified event of default from any Future Senior
Debt Representative (as the case may be);

(c) a Future Senior Issuer Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the relevant event of default is continuing at the end of the Future Senior Debt Issuer Standstill Period,

A “Future Senior Debt Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that any Future Senior
Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice on the Credit Facility Agent, the Cash Management Facility
Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the representative of any Future Pari Passu Debt and the Future
Second Lien Debt Representative(s) until the earliest of:

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action (including the enforcement of any
Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that
any Future Senior Debt Representative and Future Senior Creditors may only take the same Enforcement
Action against the same entity as is taken by the Senior Secured Creditors and may not take any other action
against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of the Future Senior Issuer and/or any guarantor of
the Future Senior Liabilities against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

178


-----

(d) the expiration of any other Future Senior Debt Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the
current Future Senior Debt Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or
permitted remedy thereof).

A “Future Senior Issuer Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that any Future Senior
Debt Representative serves an enforcement notice on the RCF Agent, the Cash Management Facility Agent, the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the representative of any Future Pari Passu Debt and the Future Second Lien Debt
Representative(s) until the earliest of:

(a) 90 days after such date in respect of an event of default arising by reason of non-payment and 150 days after
such date in respect of any other event of default;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action in respect of the Future Senior Issuer
(including the enforcement of any Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement);

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of the Future Senior Issuer; and

(d) the expiration of any other Future Senior Issuer Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the
current Future Senior Issuer Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or
permitted remedy thereof).

If the Security Agent has notified any Future Senior Debt Representative that it is enforcing Transaction
Security, no other Future Senior Creditor may take any enforcement action against that Debtor, Third Party
Security Provider, or any subsidiary of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider (as the case may be) while
the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Transaction Security where such action might be reasonably
likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom. If the Future
Senior Creditors are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require the enforcement of such
Transaction Security, such Enforcement Action must require the realization of the relevant Security by way of a
sale or disposal conducted in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Curing of certain Events of Default and termination of Enforcement_**

If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made aware of such fact)
any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation relating to enforcement) relying
solely on that Event of Default shall cease to continue.

_Consultation_

Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Transaction
Security and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal and/or the release or disposal of claims or Transaction
Security on a distressed disposal (“Enforcement”), the relevant representative of the Senior Secured Liabilities and/
or Super Senior Liabilities (as applicable) shall notify the Security Agent and the creditor representatives for each of
the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors that the applicable Transaction Security has
become enforceable. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent
to solicit instructions to enforce security or take any other Enforcement Action given by the Super Majority Super
Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the
relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which, the Credit Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of
the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Cash Management Facility Agent, the representative of any Future
_Pari Passu Creditors and the Senior Secured Note Trustee will consult in good faith with each other and the_
Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter period
as the relevant parties may agree) with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an Instructing Group
and agreeing an enforcement strategy (the “Consultation Period”).

No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of the
Consultation Period), in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles
set forth below (“Qualifying Instructions”) where:

(a) any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting the
Future Senior Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a borrower or a guarantor, a Third Party Security
Provider (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or any Material Subsidiary (as that term is
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (each a “Relevant Company”); or

179


-----

(b) subject to no instructions having been given by an Instructing Group in the circumstances described below,
the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors determine in good faith
(and notifies each other representative agent of the Super Senior Creditors, each Cash Management Facility,
the Senior Secured Creditors, the Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Security Agent) that any delay caused
by such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level such
that (following application thereof in accordance with the Payments Waterfall described below) the Super
Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full or have a material adverse effect of the ability to effect an
enforcement or a distressed disposal and in this case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to
protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or, as the case may be, the Super Senior
Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in
accordance with the instructions first received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be instructed to implement
the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes silence is
deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received by the end of the Consultation Period, the Security Agent
shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security and/or take the
relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, in each case provided such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions
received by the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked.

If the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting reasonably)
consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security
Enforcement Principles, subject to (a) and (b) above, the relevant representative shall give notice to the other
representatives after which each such representative shall consult with the Security Agent for a period of 10 days
(or such lesser period as the relevant representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of
Enforcement, provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each
Enforcement Action.

For the purposes of Enforcement, an “Instructing Group” means:

(1) if prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date (as that term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement),
the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if:

(a) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been repaid in full in cash within six months of the end of the
Consultation Period (or within six months of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, where no consultation period is required);

(b) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other
Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within three months
of the delivery of a specified notice by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, where no consultation
period is required); or

(c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Relevant Company and the Security Agent has not
commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at that time with
respect to such Relevant Company,

then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by the Super
Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions) to the
exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any
instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and “Instructing Group” in
relation to such Enforcement shall mean the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors. Subject to the
foregoing, in the event of conflicting Enforcement Instructions, the “Instructing Group” shall mean the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors provided that such instructions from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors are Qualifying Instructions, it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction
Security or Distressed Disposal pursuant to such instructions will be determined by the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors;

(2) after the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

180


-----

(3) on or after the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date but prior to the Future Second Lien Debt Discharge
Date, the Majority Future Second Lien Creditors; and

(4) on or after the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date and the Future Second Lien Debt Discharge Date, the
Majority Senior Creditors.

Prior to the later of the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date: (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the
Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Shared Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from
an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the
Transaction Security which the Majority Future Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security
Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as described under the heading “Restrictions on
Enforcement by the Future Second Lien Creditors” above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time any
Future Second Lien Creditor or its Creditor Representative is then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions
to enforce the Transaction Security and the Majority Future Second Lien Creditors do not give such instruction
and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the
Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to
enforce given by the Future Second Lien Creditors or its Creditor Representative under the Intercreditor
Agreement and Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

Prior to the later of the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date and the Future Second Lien Debt Discharge Date:
(i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction
Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group
has not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent
shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Shared Security which the Majority Senior Creditors are then
entitled to give to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, as described under the
heading “Restrictions on Enforcement by the Future Creditors; Future Senior Debt Standstill” above.
Notwithstanding the paragraph above, if at any time any Senior Creditor or its Creditor Representative is then
entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Shared Security pursuant to the above and the
Majority Senior Creditors do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction,
then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Shared Security as the
Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce given by the Senior Creditors or its Creditor
Representative under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received
from the Instructing Group.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of the Senior Notes Only
Security in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement where the Security Agent will act in
accordance with and subject to the instructions of the Majority Senior Creditors (as that term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

_Security Enforcement Principles_

Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Super Majority Super Senior
Creditors, the Majority Cash Management Facility Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the
Senior Secured Notes Required Holders (as defined below) (if prior to the Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date),
the Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders (as defined below) (and to the extent relating to the definition of
Security Enforcement Objective or paragraph (a) below, the Majority Future Second Lien Creditors),
enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement
**Principles,” which are summarized as follows:**

(a) It shall, subject to any requirements of applicable law, be the primary and overriding aim of any
enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious
realization of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, the recovery by the Super Senior
Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors, the Future Pari Passu Creditors and the Future Second Lien
Creditors (to the extent that Transaction Security is expressed to secure the Future Second Lien Liabilities)
(the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(b) The Transaction Security will, subject to any requirements of applicable law, be enforced and other action
as to Enforcement will be taken such that either (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security
Agent in cash (or substantially all in cash) for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or
(ii) sufficient proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when

181


-----

the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid
and discharged in full (unless the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the other
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any requirements of applicable law, the time frame for the
realization of value from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) pursuant to Enforcement will be determined by the Instructing Group provided that it is consistent
with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(d) On a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security, the Security Agent shall (unless such
enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a
determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or
international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in
providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction
Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing
the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Principles and maximize recovery of any
such Enforcement Action, (B) that the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance
with the Security Enforcement Objective. Such Financial Advisor shall be selected by the Instructing Group
giving any enforcement instructions to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Agent shall be directed to appoint such Financial Adviser in any such enforcement
instruction.

(e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a
Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement and it has received
instructions as to the identity of such Financial Advisor from the Instructing Group. The liability of any
Financial Advisor in respect of the opinions referred to in paragraph (d) above may be limited to the amount
of its fees in respect of such engagement.

(f) The Financial Advisor’s opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has
been met and the Security Agent shall not be liable to any party as a result of having acted on the basis of
the instructions given to it by the Instructing Group, as opined on by the Financial Advisor.

(g) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares and such Enforcement
is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Group shall be entitled to participate in
such auction. There is no requirement in the Security Enforcement Principles that requires the Enforcement
of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction.

(h) In the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the relevant
Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds
that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an
“Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is
in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(i) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to
rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with this Agreement), a Financial
Advisor’s opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving
the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above
has been met.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of the Senior Notes Only
Security.

_Turnover_

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Senior Creditor, Cash Management Facility Creditor,
Super Senior Hedging Lender, Senior Secured Creditor, Future Pari Passu Creditor, Future Senior Creditor or
Future Second Lien Creditor receives or recovers the proceeds of any Enforcement of Transaction Security
(whether before or after an insolvency event) or any Senior Notes Only Security not permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement or applied other than in accordance with Payments Waterfall that it shall (subject to
certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and any Future
Senior Debt Representative, as applicable):

 - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount of that
receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities of that creditor (or, if less, the amount received or

182

recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that amount
to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and
(ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant
liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

 - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal
to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor

Creditors, Future Senior Creditors and Subordinated Creditors.

_Application of proceeds/Waterfall_

or any part of the Transaction Security (and, in relation to the Future Senior Creditors, Shared Security) or

**_Release and/or transfer of claims and liabilities in respect of the Future Senior Debt and the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes and the Transaction Security_**

_Non-distressed disposal_

In circumstances where a disposal or other transaction whereby a release, consent or other step in relation to,
Transaction Security is considered necessary or desirable by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in connection with
such transaction (including to reflect the Agreed Security Principles), is not being effected pursuant to a
Distressed Disposal and is otherwise permitted by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Credit
Facility Documents, the Cash Management Facility Documents, the Future Pari Passu Debt Documents, the
Future Second Lien Debt Documents and the Future Senior Debt Documents (as those terms are defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that (subject to certain conditions) the Security
Agent is authorized (i) to release relevant the Transaction Security or any other relevant claim (relating to a Debt
Document) over any relevant asset; (ii) where any relevant asset consists of all the shares in the capital of an
Obligor, to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over the assets of
that Obligor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries; (iii) to execute and deliver or enter into any
release of the Transaction Security or any claim described in (i) and/or (ii) above and issue any certificates of

action on behalf of the Secured Parties in connection with the same that is permitted under the relevant Debt
Documents provided that, to the extent that replacement Transaction Security is required from the transferee
under the terms of the Debt Documents, such Transaction Security shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be granted at the same time as (or before) the relevant disposal is
effected.

_Distressed Disposal_

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group or of a holding company
(including the Parent) which in each case is subject to the Transaction Security or any disposal of a Material
Subsidiary (as that term is defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as at the date of the Intercreditor
Agreement) or all or substantially all of the assets of a Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement as at the date of the Intercreditor Agreement) which is (a) being effected at the request of the
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable, (b) being effected by
enforcement of the Transaction Security, or (c) being effected, after the occurrence of a Distress Event (as

Creditor under the Debt Documents, both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly with any
other person or in any other capacity, together with any additional liabilities (the “Liabilities”); or (z) any

Liabilities, on behalf of, in each case the relevant Creditors, Obligors and Third Party Security Providers: and

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an Obligor or the holding company of an
Obligor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent decides to transfer to another Obligor or a holding

of that Disposed Entity in respect of (x) the Intra- Group Liabilities; (y) the Liabilities owed by any member

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected (provided that, for this purpose, a Distressed Disposal shall not be
deemed to include reference to any disposal of a Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) or all or substantially all of the assets of a Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement)) such that the Future Second Lien Liabilities’ and Transaction Security over shares in the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or assets of a Future Second Lien Guarantor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will

person invited that is a Primary Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) at the time of
such invitation), which may or may not be conducted through court or other legal proceedings,
and which is conducted with the advice of a Financial Advisor) in which the Future Second Lien
Creditors (or a representative acting on their behalf) shall be entitled to participate as bidder or
financier to the potential purchaser and shall be provided equal information rights as any other
bidder, subject to applicable securities law (and for the avoidance of doubt in which the Future
Second Lien Creditors or a representative acting on their behalf are also entitled to participate);

(II) pursuant to any process or proceedings approved or supervised by or on behalf of any court of law
which has jurisdiction and where there is a determination of value by or on behalf of such court;
or

(III) where a Financial Advisor has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the
amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account
all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement and the circumstances giving rise
to such sale, provided that the liability of Financial Advisor in giving such opinion may be limited
to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

If prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the
Majority Future Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company that is a member of the Group from any
Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any
Super Senior Creditor unless those Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities and any
other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating
to a Letter of Credit, Cash Management Facility LC, a Cash Management Facility or an Ancillary Facility, made
the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor), following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Future Senior Liabilities and Shared Security will be

If prior to the later of the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date and the Future Second Lien Discharge Date, a
Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Senior Creditors are entitled to give, and have
given, instructions, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company
that is a member of the Group from any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities owed
to any Senior Secured Creditor, Super Senior Creditor or Future Second Lien Creditor unless those Borrowing
Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Future Second
Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating to a Letter of
Credit, Cash Management Facility LC, a Cash Management Facility or an Ancillary Facility, made the subject of
cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor), following that release.

If a disposal of an asset subject to the Senior Notes Only Security is being effected (i) at the request of the

(including the release of any Senior Notes Only Security) and the net proceeds of the disposal shall be paid to the
Security Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Senior Notes Only Security Payments Waterfall provided
that, if such disposal occurs prior to the later of the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date and the Future Second
Lien Discharge Date, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding Company
that is a member of the Group from any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities or Other Liabilities owed

Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent Liability relating to a Letter of
Credit, Cash Management Facility LC, a Cash Management Facility or an Ancillary Facility, made the subject of
cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor), following that release.

_Application of proceeds of a Distressed Disposal_

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities) shall be paid to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set forth under “- Application of proceeds/
Waterfall’ as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent
that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if the disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

_Governing law_

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

**Itelyum Proceeds Loans**

On or about the Completion Date, the Issuer will make available to Itelyum Regeneration the Itelyum
Regeneration Proceeds Loan for an estimated aggregate principal amount of €82.3 million and to Itelyum
Purification the Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan for an estimated aggregate principal amount of
€68.1 million. The amounts borrowed by Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification under the Itelyum
Proceeds Loans will be used as described under “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”

Interest on the Itelyum Proceeds Loans will accrue at a rate that we anticipate will be generally consistent with
the rate applicable to the Notes. The maturity date of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans will be on or about the maturity
date of the Notes.

Subject to certain significant exceptions, the Itelyum Proceeds Loans documentation will prohibit the repayment,
reduction, extinction or equitization of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans. Such exceptions include, but are not limited
to, the repayment of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans to enable the Issuer to make payments of principal and interest
on the Notes. The Indenture will not include any restrictions on the Issuer, Itelyum Regeneration or Itelyum
Purification to amend the Itelyum Proceeds Loans documentation, including to permit the repayment of the
Itelyum Proceeds Loans in order to allow the Issuer to discharge other debt secured by the Collateral. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The principal amount of the receivables_
_forming part of the Collateral may be reduced as a result of prepayments of such loans prior to the maturity date_
_of the Notes.”_

The agreement governing the Itelyum Proceeds Loans will not provide for any undertakings or representations by
the parties. The Issuer’s interest in the receivables under the Itelyum Proceeds Loans will be subject to security
on a first-ranking basis as part of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The
agreement governing the Itelyum Proceeds Loans will be governed by Italian law.

191


-----

Upon completion of the Post Completion Merger, the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan will be terminated
and the security interest over the Issuer’s interest in the receivables in respect of the Itelyum Regeneration
Proceeds Loan will be extinguished by operation of law.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

Verde Bidco S.p.A. (formerly known as Noosa S.r.l.) (the “Issuer”) will issue €450.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of 4.625% Sustainability-Linked Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) under an
indenture to be dated as of October 1, 2021 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, Verde Midco
S.r.l. (“Holdco”), as third-party security provider, The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c., as trustee of the
holders of the Notes and common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to
Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code (the “Trustee”) under the Indenture, and UniCredit S.p.A., as
security agent under the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) and representative (rappresentante) of the
holders of the Notes pursuant to and for the purposes set forth under Article 2414-bis, 3rd paragraph of the Italian
Civil Code (the “Security Representative”) under the Indenture (the “Security Agent”). Definitions of certain
capitalized terms used in this “Description of Notes” are set forth under the heading “—Certain Definitions”
below. For purposes of this “Description of Notes,” “Issuer” means Verde Bidco S.p.A. (not including any of its
Subsidiaries) and any and all successors thereto (including, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo (as
defined below)).

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer. Prior to the Completion
Date, the Issuer will not control the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of Notes.” As such, the Issuer cannot
assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that
would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of
and from the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date.

If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date, pending
consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Initial
Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross
proceeds of this Offering of the Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the
terms of an escrow deed (the “Escrow Agreement”), to be dated the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee
and Bank of America, National Association, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). The release of the Escrowed
Property (as defined below) from the Escrow Account will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement within one
Business Day following the release of the funds from the Escrow Account. If the proceeds of the Notes are
deposited into the Escrow Account and the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property have not been
satisfied on or prior to January 31, 2022 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence of certain other
events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined herein). The Special Mandatory
Redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined herein). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

Upon release from escrow, the proceeds of the Offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the
Issuer, together with the Equity Contribution (as defined under “Summary—The Transactions—The Financing”)
and cash on balance sheet of the Target Group, to fund the purchase price for the Acquisition, repay certain
outstanding debt of the Target Group and pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, as
described further in this Offering Memorandum under “Use of Proceeds.”

This “Description of Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the Guarantees
and the Indenture. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the
Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights.
In addition, the following description refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. Copies
of such documents are available from us upon request as set forth under “Listing and General Information.”

The Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees thereunder will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important
to understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees.
Please see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the
material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The registered holder (a “Holder”) of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions. In addition, the Indenture will not be subject to, incorporate by reference or
otherwise include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

193


-----

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €450.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued on the Issue Date. After the Issue Date, we may issue an unlimited principal
amount of additional Notes having substantially identical terms and conditions as the Notes originally issued
(together with any notes issued under the Indenture of any other series as further described below, the
“Additional Notes”) under the Indenture. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance
with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness
(as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”).

Any such Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes originally issued, except in
respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (as defined below)
supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes may be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes may bear interest and, if
applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date
or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest may be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of
holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes may be denominated and the currency in which
cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the maturity date or dates of such Additional Notes, and the date or dates and price or prices at which, the
period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be
redeemed, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, any special mandatory redemption using
amounts released from any escrow account into which proceeds of the issuance of such Additional Notes are
deposited pending consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction (such
redemption, an “Additional Notes Special Mandatory Redemption”);

(7) the provisions relating to the escrow of all or a portion of the proceeds of such Additional Notes and the
granting of Liens described in clause (22) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee
solely for the benefit of the Holders of such Additional Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the
benefit of the Holders of any other Notes), together with all necessary authorizations for the Trustee to enter
into such arrangements; provided that, for so long as the proceeds of such Additional Notes are in escrow,
such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and shall not be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall not benefit from any security interest in the
Collateral;

(8) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes may be issued and redeemed;

(9) the status of registration with the SEC of such Additional Notes or the applicable exemption from such
registration pursuant to which such Additional Notes may be offered or sold; and

(10) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes, and the relevant clearing systems.

The Notes (together with any Additional Notes issued from time to time) will be treated as a single class for the
purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for a specific series. Unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, for all
purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes issued on
the Issue Date under the Indenture and any Additional Notes that are actually issued from time to time.
Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the Notes
issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other
series, and if so designated shall be deemed to form one series with such other series (it being understood that
any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other series of Notes but for
being subject to an Additional Notes Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially
identical to such series of Notes only following the date on which such Additional Notes Special Mandatory
Redemption provision ceases to apply).

194


-----

In the event that any Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes issued on the Issue Date for U.S. federal
income tax and/or Italian tax purposes, such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable
from such Notes.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will, on the Issue Date:

Collateral only after certain obligations entitled to receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in
priority to the Notes have been repaid in full, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain Hedging Obligations, if any.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Guarantee of each Guarantor will, at the time the relevant Guarantor grants such Guarantee:

 - be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

 - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not

senior guarantee given in favor of the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any;

The Issuer will issue €450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes will
mature on October 1, 2026. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Interest on the Notes will initially accrue at the rate of 4.625% per annum.
Interest on the Notes will:

 - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

 - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2022;

 - be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related
interest payment date (for Notes held in global form); and

 - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Notes will be subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”). If the due date for any
payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the
Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such
place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Sustainability Performance Targets Step-up Redemption Premium**

On or prior to each Sustainability Report Publication Date (as defined below), the Issuer intends to publish on its
website a Sustainability Report (as defined below) with respect to the Group’s performance in respect of the
Sustainability Performance Targets (as defined below) for the relevant financial year and an Assurance Letter (as
defined below).

In the event the Issuer redeems the Notes pursuant to (i) the second or fifth paragraph of “—Optional
_Redemption” at any time on or after June 30, 2022 (the “2021 Sustainability Report Publication Date”) and/or_
(ii) “—Redemption at Maturity” and, in each case, unless the Group has met both of the Sustainability
Performance Targets on the relevant Testing Date (as defined below), as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee
(with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an Officer’s Certificate, which shall also include an Assurance Letter, on or
prior to the relevant Certification Date, the applicable Step-up Premium (each as defined below) will be payable
in connection with the applicable redemption of the Notes in accordance with the second paragraph of
_“—Optional Redemption,” the definition of “Applicable Premium” or “—Redemption at Maturity,” as_
applicable.

The sole consequence under the Indenture and the Notes for failure by the Group to meet one or more
Sustainability Performance Targets on the relevant Testing Date or failure by the Issuer to deliver an Officer’s
Certificate or an Assurance Letter to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) on or prior to the relevant
Certification Date will be the payment of the relevant Step-up Premium in the circumstances described above.
Accordingly, for the avoidance of doubt, none of the following events shall constitute a Default or an Event of
Default under the Indenture: (i) the failure by the Group to meet one or more Sustainability Performance Targets;
(ii) the failure by the Issuer to publish on its website a Sustainability Report; (ii) the failure by the Issuer to
publish an Assurance Letter; or (iii) an Assurance Letter fails to confirm that either or both Sustainability
Performance Targets have been met by the Group on the relevant Testing Date.

Pursuant to the Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework (as defined in this Offering Memorandum), the
Sustainability Performance Targets will remain applicable for so long as any Notes remain outstanding,
regardless of any changes to the Group’s sustainability strategy. This includes any changes relating to the
Group’s general sustainability targets and ambitions. Moreover, any acquisition or divestment by the Group shall
be taken into account in the calculation but shall not result in a change of the calculation methodology or a
recalibration of the Sustainability Performance Targets or the SLB Baselines.

The CO2 Baseline has been calculated by the Itelyum Group in good faith but has not been independently
verified or audited by the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers or any other third party. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—No assurance or representation is given by us, the_
_Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, any second party opinion provider or any External Reviewer as to the suitability_
_or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of any opinion, report (including our Sustainability Reports and_
_Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework), certification or validation of any third party in connection with the_
_Offering or the Sustainability Performance Targets to fulfil any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked_
_and/or other criteria. The Notes are not “green bonds.” Moreover, the CO2 Baseline presented herein has not_
_been independently verified or audited by any third party. There will be limited consequences under the_
_Indenture for our failure to meet the Sustainability Performance Targets.”_

196


-----

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the Officer’s Certificate and
Assurance Letter from the Issuer, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Assurance
Letter or related Officer’s Certificate, verify the attainment of the Sustainability Performance Targets, or make
calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to the attainment of the Sustainability Performance
Targets or the Step-up Premium. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Issuer, any holder of
Notes or any other Person in acting in good faith on any Assurance Letter and related Officer’s Certificate. For
the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Step-up Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar.

Set forth below is a summary of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation of the Step-up
Premium:

“Step-up Premium” means (a) 0.300% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, unless the Group
has achieved the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target on the relevant Testing Date, plus (b) 0.300% of the
principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, unless the Group has achieved the Quantity of Waste for Circular
Treatments Target on the relevant Testing Date, in each case, as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee (with a
copy to the Paying Agent) in an Officer’s Certificate, which shall also include an Assurance Letter, on or prior to
the relevant Certification Date (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the Step-up Premium shall be 0% if
the Group has met both Sustainability Performance Targets on the relevant Testing Date, (ii) the Step-up
Premium shall not exceed 0.300% if either (x) the Group has met the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target on
the relevant Testing Date but has not met the Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target on the relevant
Testing Date or (y) the Group has met the Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target on the relevant
Testing Date but has not met the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target on the relevant Testing Date and (iii) in
no event shall the Step-up Premium exceed 0.600% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed (this
being the consequence of the Issuer failing to meet both Sustainability Performance Targets on the relevant
Testing Date or failure by the Issuer to deliver an Officer’s Certificate or an Assurance Letter to the Trustee (with
a copy to the Paying Agent) on or prior to the relevant Certification Date)).

“Assurance Letter” means a customary assurance letter from an External Reviewer confirming that the Gross
CO2 Avoided Emissions Target and/or the Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target has or have been
met on the relevant Testing Date.

“Certification Date” means the date that is 15 days prior to the applicable redemption date.

“External Reviewer” means a qualified provider of third-party assurance or attestation services appointed by the
Issuer to review the Group’s compliance with the Sustainability Performance Targets.

“Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target” means, for any Testing Date, a percentage increase in gross CO2
avoided emissions, measured in tons, during the financial year ending on such Testing Date of at least, as
applicable, (i) 4% on the First Testing Date, (ii) 8% on the Second Testing Date, (iii) 14% on the Third Testing
Date, (iv) 20% on the Fourth Testing Date or (v) 25% on the Final Testing Date, in each case of clauses
(i) through (v), compared to the baseline of 430,449.6 tons of CO2 as of December 31, 2020.

“Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target” means, for any Testing Date, a percentage increase in
the quantity of waste collected and delivered to circular treatments, measured in tons, during the financial year
ending on such Testing Date of at least, as applicable, (i) 4% on the First Testing Date, (ii) 8% on the Second
Testing Date, (iii) 14% on the Third Testing Date, (iv) 20% on the Fourth Testing Date or (v) 25% on the Final
Testing Date, in each case of clauses (i) through (v), compared to the baseline of 574,184 tons of waste collected
and delivered to circular treatments for the year ended December 31, 2020.

“Sustainability Performance Targets” means the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target and the Quantity of
Waste for Circular Treatments Target.

“Sustainability Report” means the relevant publication by the Issuer, covering each relevant financial year from
and including the financial year ending on December 31, 2021 to and including the financial year ending on
December 31, 2025, providing data and information relevant for the calculation of the Group’s performance
against the Sustainability Performance Targets.

“Sustainability Report Publication Date” means, as applicable, the 2021 Sustainability Report Publication
Date, the 2022 Sustainability Report Publication Date, the 2023 Sustainability Report Publication Date, the 2024
Sustainability Report Publication Date or the 2025 Sustainability Report Publication Date.

197


-----

“Testing Date” means, as applicable, (i) December 31, 2021 (the “First Testing Date”), if the applicable
redemption date is on or after the 2021 Sustainability Report Publication Date but before June 30, 2023 (the
“2022 Sustainability Report Publication Date”), (ii) December 31, 2022 (the “Second Testing Date”), if the
applicable redemption date is on or after the 2022 Sustainability Report Publication Date but before June 30,
2024 (the “2023 Sustainability Report Publication Date”), (iii) December 31, 2023 (the “Third Testing
**Date”), if the applicable redemption date is on or after the 2023 Sustainability Report Publication Date but before**
June 30, 2025 (the “2024 Sustainability Report Publication Date”), (iv) December 31, 2024 (the “Fourth
**Testing Date”), if the applicable redemption date is on or after the 2024 Sustainability Report Publication Date**
but before June 30, 2026 (the “2025 Sustainability Report Publication Date”) or (v) December 31, 2025 (the
“Final Testing Date”), in the event the applicable redemption date is after the 2025 Sustainability Report
Publication Date.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be
made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by
the Holder or Holders thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by bank transfer to the
person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and
_Registrar for the Notes.”_

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of
New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch and the initial Transfer Agent
will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and, together with the Transfer
Agent, will facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any
change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg
(which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or
Transfer Agent may also be published by the Issuer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Post Completion Merger**

We will use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by any
competent authority, to implement the Post Completion Merger in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and
following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of Italian law, with MergerCo being the
surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Completion Date. Failure to complete the Post
Completion Merger shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture. Following
consummation of the Post Completion Merger, all references in the Indenture to the “Issuer” shall refer to
MergerCo, unless the context otherwise requires. The Post Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions
and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—We may be
_unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

**Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain
significant limitations under Italian law, the Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) shall use commercially

198


-----

reasonable efforts to procure that, no later than 90 days from the earlier of (i) the Post Completion Merger and
(ii) in the event the Post Completion Merger does not occur, the date falling fifteen months after the Completion
Date (the “Cut-Off Date”), Itelyum Purification and, to the extent the Post Completion Merger does not occur,
Itelyum Regeneration will each guarantee the Notes. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification accounted for 29.0% and 35.7% of the Target Group’s revenue and 40.6%
and 24.3% of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (net of intercompany flows), respectively.

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the
Revolving Credit Facility, Public Debt or certain other Indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor,
shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

For the purposes of this “Description of Notes,” “Guarantor” means Itelyum Regeneration, Itelyum Purification
and any other Restricted Subsidiary that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture
after the Completion Date (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto).

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance
under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title
claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit
the amount that can be guaranteed by each relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Guarantees will be subject to
certain corporate law procedures being complied with. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to_
_the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and the_
_Collateral.” The Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that will_
apply to, and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Notes, which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if
any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of
these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

The Issuer is a holding company established in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating
operations of its own. As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will not have any Subsidiaries. Following the Completion
Date, substantially all of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries. As a result, prior
to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends and other payments from its
Subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its outstanding indebtedness service (including under the
Notes) and other obligations, and such dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the instruments
governing our indebtedness, including any financing agreements of our Subsidiaries. Our Subsidiaries may not
generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our
indebtedness, including the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to Our Structure and the Financing—The
_Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post_
_Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the operating companies of the Target Group to be able_
_to make payments on the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—We may_
_be unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority
stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including
Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors
(including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the
Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks

199


-----

_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the_
_existing or future indebtedness or obligations of all of the Issuer’s (or MergerCo’s) subsidiaries that do not_
_guarantee the Notes.” Prior to the granting of the Guarantees by the Guarantors, the Notes will be structurally_
subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including
the Target, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. After the granting of the Guarantee by the Guarantors
(and subject to the limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Notes. As of
June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s (or MergerCo’s, as applicable)
subsidiaries which are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had €11.6 million in outstanding financial
debt, €2.8 million of which was secured, which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the
Guarantees. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries, the
limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any
limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under
the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Releases of the Guarantees_**

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate:

 - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, dissolution or merger) of the Capital
Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture;

 - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

 - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations under the Notes Documents or upon
defeasance or discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction
_and Discharge;”_

 - pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(including as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—
_Release and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of the Notes and the Transaction Security—_
_Provisions following an IPO”);_

 - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”

 - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged
from its liability with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) would not otherwise be required at the
time of such release to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees;”_

 - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees;”_

 - in connection with one or more Permitted Reorganizations; or

 - as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” (including the
Post Completion Merger, to the extent applicable).

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall, upon request (and at the cost and expense) of the Issuer and delivery to
the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate, each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each
of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders (except to the
extent required under the fifth bullet above) or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one Business Day after the Issue Date, on the Issue Date
the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the
Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering of
the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be pledged on a

200


-----

first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to an escrow charge
dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds deposited in
the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and
payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

The Escrow Agent shall promptly release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), subject only to
receipt by the Escrow Agent of an Officer’s Certificate by the Issuer to the Escrow Agent with a copy to the
Trustee (upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall be able to conclusively rely without further
investigation), on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, to the effect that:

 - the Acquisition will be consummated within one Business Day following the Release, on substantially the
same terms as described in this Offering Memorandum under the section “Summary—The Transactions,”
except for any waivers, changes or other modifications that will not, individually or when taken as whole,
materially adversely affect the Holders or to which the Holders have consented; and

 - as of the date of delivery of the Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default under clause
(5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “—Events of Default” below with respect to the Issuer.

Upon the Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be paid out in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above does not take place on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date, (b) at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the
Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement
terminates at any time on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (d) Permitted Holders cease to beneficially own
or control a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer or (e) a Default or Event of Default
arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under “—Events of Default” on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date with respect to the Issuer (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer
will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Price”) equal to 100.0% of the issue price of the Notes, plus accrued interest and Additional**
Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined
below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below)).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, and will provide
that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by
the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”).
On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to
each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the
payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer. If the Completion Date is
anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date and the proceeds of the Notes are deposited
into the Escrow Account, pursuant to a shortfall agreement between the Issuer and Holdco to be entered on or
about the Issue Date (the “Shortfall Agreement”), Holdco will be required to contribute to the Escrow Account
an amount equal to the amount by which the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special
Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Transactions—If certain conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be_
_required to redeem the Notes, which means holders of the Notes may not obtain the return they expect on the_
_Notes. In addition, the Issuer might not have sufficient funds to pay all of the amounts due to the holders of the_
_Notes in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Holders of the Notes a security interest in the Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee of either an
Officer’s Certificate for the Release or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed
consent by the Trustee for the Release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special
Mandatory Redemption.

201


-----

If the gross proceeds of the Offering are not deposited into the Escrow Account on the Issue Date and the
Completion Date does not occur within one Business Day of the Issue Date, then, unless the Completion Date
occurs on the following Business Day, the Issuer will promptly either (i) redeem the Notes pursuant to a special
mandatory redemption in the case that (x) in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be
consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or (y) an Event of Default described under clause (5) of
the first paragraph under the heading titled “—Events of Default” below with respect to the Issuer occurs or (ii)
deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

Amounts of the Escrowed Property may be released from the Escrow Account prior to the Completion Date to
pay negative interest charged on the Escrow Account (if any) and to pay interest on the Notes and any Additional
Amounts on any interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the Release.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Escrow Longstop Date or the Issuer’s obligations to redeem the
Notes in connection with a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified with the consent of
Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

 - Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”); and

 - Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).

The Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book**Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the**
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of the United States and any other jurisdiction._

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions

202


-----

relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the
participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a
Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, the Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will not have any Subsidiaries. As of the Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s
Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture.

However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the
Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date and the proceeds
of the Notes are deposited into the Escrow Account, on the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the
Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the Escrowed Property. See “—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

On or about the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security interests granted on an equal and ratable
first-priority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

(1) 100% of the share capital of the Issuer;

(2) the material current bank accounts of the Issuer opened in Italy;

(3) certain material structural receivables owed to Holdco by the Issuer (if any); and

(4) certain material structural receivables owed to the Issuer by any members of the Target Group, including
receivables in respect of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans (collectively, the “Completion Date Collateral”).

203


-----

Within 30 Business Days after the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security interests granted on an
equal and ratable first-priority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

(1) 100% of the share capital of the Target (the “Target Share Pledge”); and

(2) subject to certain significant limitations under Italian law, 100% of the share capital of each of Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification (together with the Target Share Pledge, the “Post Completion Date
**Collateral” and, together with the Completion Date Collateral, the “Pre Merger Collateral”).**

No later than 30 Business Days following the completion of the relocation of the Target’s legal seat and tax
residence from Luxembourg to Italy, subject to and on the terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles,
the Issuer will reconfirm the Target Share Pledge or, to the extent required under Italian law, grant an Italian law
share pledge in respect of 100% of the share capital of the Target.

Following the Post Completion Merger, in the event that the Target or Itelyum Regeneration is the successor
company of the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo will, upon consummation of the Post Completion Merger,
assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture. Concurrently with the Post Completion
Merger and as a result thereof, the security interest over the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the Itelyum
Regeneration Proceeds Loan will be automatically terminated and depending on which entity will survive the
Post Completion Merger, certain other Pre Merger Collateral will be extinguished by operation of law and, in
particular, (a) in the event that the Issuer is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, the Target
Share Pledge and the pledge over the share capital of Itelyum Regeneration, will be extinguished by operation of
law; (b) in the event that the Target is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, the pledge over the
share capital of the Issuer and the pledge over the share capital of Itelyum Regeneration will be extinguished by
operation of law; and (c) in the event that Itelyum Regeneration is the successor company of the Post Completion
Merger, the pledge over the share capital of the Issuer and the Target Share Pledge will be extinguished by
operation of law.

In addition, subject to and on terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days following
completion of the Post Completion Merger:

(1) MergerCo will grant (or reconfirm, as applicable) (x) security over any shares held by MergerCo in any
Guarantor; (y) an Italian law pledge in respect of certain material current bank accounts of MergerCo
opened in Italy; and (z) security over certain material structural receivables owed to MergerCo by any
Guarantor (if any); and

(2) Holdco will grant or reconfirm, as applicable, (x) an Italian law share pledge in respect of 100% of Holdco’s
shares in MergerCo and (y) an Italian law security assignment agreement in respect of certain material
structural receivables owed to HoldCo by MergerCo (if any) (the Collateral described under clauses (1) and
(2), collectively, the “Post Merger Collateral”).

In the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure that the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,”_
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitation on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and_
_other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral,” by security interests granted on a first-priority basis over any shares held by_
each of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as applicable, in any Guarantors, certain material structural receivables
owed to each of the Issuer and the Guarantors by any Guarantor (if any) and certain material current bank
accounts of each of the Issuer and the Guarantors (collectively, the “Target Group Collateral”) within 90 days
of the Cut-Off Date to the extent such security interests have not already been provided as part of the Pre Merger
Collateral.

The Completion Date Collateral, the Post Completion Date Collateral, the Post Merger Collateral and the Target
Group Collateral, as applicable, together with any and all assets in respect of which from time to time a Security
Interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document to secure the obligations under the
Indenture or the Notes and/or any Guarantee, in each case as may be in existence from time to time, is referred to
herein as the “Collateral.”

204


-----

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are_
permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness, including any
Additional Notes issued by the Issuer as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be secured only to
_the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and other secured_
_indebtedness may be secured by assets that do not secure the Notes.” All Collateral will be subject to the_
operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain property, rights and assets (other than the Collateral described_
above in this section) may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the
Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed Security
Principles, a guarantee or security may not be given, or may be limited. The following is a summary of certain
terms of the Agreed Security Principles:

 - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance (including, without
limitation, pursuant to articles 2358 or 2474 of the Italian Civil Code), capital maintenance, corporate
benefit, equity subordination, fraudulent preference, limitations of the granting of guarantee by holding
companies, interest stripping, controlled foreign corporation, transfer pricing or thin capitalization rules,
exchange control restrictions, minority shareholder protection/equal treatment of shareholder rules, tax
restrictions retention of title claims and similar principles may prohibit, limit or otherwise restrict the ability
of a security provider to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be
limited by an amount or otherwise;

 - in certain jurisdictions, it may be impossible, impractical, or disproportionately costly to create guarantees
or security over certain categories of assets, in which event guarantees or security will not be taken over
such assets;

 - subject to certain conditions, any assets or security providers subject to third party arrangements which may
prevent those assets from being charged or assigned or those security providers from giving a security or
guarantee (or assets which, if charged or assigned, would give a third party the right to terminate or
otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the security provider in respect of those assets or
require any security provider to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (the “Group”) or any member of the Group) will be excluded from any relevant
security document and any requirement to give security or guarantee;

 - certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), minority shareholder
or another external body’s or person’s consent may be required to enable a security provider to provide a
guarantee or security;

 - no security provider will be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if (i) it is not within
the legal capacity of the relevant security provider to do so, (ii) it results in the security document being null
and void, or (iii) it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their or any affiliates’ directors, officers or
employees, contravene any legal, contractual or regulatory prohibition, or regulatory or contractual
condition or result in a risk of personal, contractual or criminal liability on the part of any director, officer or
employee;

 - security that requires payment in Italy of an ad valorem registration tax on the amount of the secured
obligations will not be taken (i) unless it can be executed by way of exchange of correspondence or in any
other form required under the applicable law (other than Italian law) governing the relevant security which
does not give rise to any such ad valorem registration tax, or (ii) if tax duty cannot be minimized upon
execution, including by securing only the relevant grantor’s own obligations as borrower;

 - no security provider that is subject to a license under any law or regulation that would prohibit or materially
restrict the granting of security or giving of guarantees shall be required to grant any security or give any
guarantees, provided that reasonable endeavours (not involving the payment of any material fees or the
incurrence of any material costs or expenses) to obtain consent or waivers from any relevant party shall be
used by the relevant security provider if, in the view of the Issuer (acting reasonably), granting such security
or giving such guarantee will have no material adverse impact on relationships with third parties or
otherwise force the relevant security provider or the Group to pay any material fees or incur any material
costs or expenses;

 - the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible, subject to any non-consensual liens and other liens
mandatorily preferred by any applicable law and permitted under the finance documents;

205


-----

 - security shall not be required to be granted over any trade receivables, intellectual property, livestock,
moveable plant, equipment, insurance policies, real estate assets or vehicles, and any security provider shall
be free to deal with such assets in the course of its business or as otherwise permitted or not prohibited
under the finance documents;

 - no guarantees or security will be required in jurisdictions other than Italy and any jurisdiction in which any
borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is incorporated (a “Guarantor Jurisdiction”);

 - security shall be limited to (i) security over the shares (or quotas or partnership interests, if applicable)
owned by: Holdco in the Issuer (or, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo); the Issuer in the
Target; the Target in Itelyum Regeneration; the Target and Itelyum Regeneration in Itelyum Purification;
and an obligor or a wholly-owned member of the Group incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction in a
wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction or Centro Risorse S.r.l. or
Castiglia S.r.l. which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same
basis as consolidated EBITDA) representing more than five (5) per cent. of consolidated EBITDA of the
Group (a “Material Subsidiary”), (ii) security over material bank accounts owned by the Issuer or a
Material Subsidiary which is an obligor that are opened in a Guarantor Jurisdiction and (iii) security over
material intercompany receivables that are structural intercompany receivables owed to an obligor, Holdco
or a wholly-owned member of the Group incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction by a Material Subsidiary,
in each case in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles;

 - all security (subject to certain exceptions) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located only in
the jurisdiction of incorporation of that security provider and where possible, the transaction security
documents governed by Italian law will be executed by way of exchange of correspondence (scambio di
_corrispondenza commerciale), or outside Italy, in order to minimize any documentary tax cost connected_
with their execution;

 - notification of security will only be given where required by local law to perfect the security;

 - transaction security will be granted on an “as is, where is” basis, and no security provider will be required to
procure any changes to or corrections of filings on external registers other than (for the avoidance of doubt)
to register transaction security under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement; and

 - no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where security providers are not incorporated but
perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of incorporation of one security provider in relation to
security granted by another security provider incorporated in a different jurisdiction.

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the
extent of the guarantees and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected
in any security taken.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure on a first-priority basis the liabilities under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, as well as certain Hedging Obligations (if any) and any Additional Notes
and may also secure certain future indebtedness; provided, however, that pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) and
providers of certain future indebtedness will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in
priority to the holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes. See “—Priority.” See also, “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and_
_counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the_
_terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are_
_entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes.”_

In the future, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations (if any) and any Additional Notes in certain circumstances may also benefit from security which
does not secure the Notes offered hereby.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a description of such limitations, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk_

206


-----

_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will_
_be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to_
_certain hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the_
_Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to_
_be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with respect to Security Interests among the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, secured by the Collateral, the Trustee, the
Security Agent, the Holders of the Notes and the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured
by the Collateral, respectively, is or will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility, such
Hedging Obligations, or other Indebtedness, as applicable. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among
other things, that the obligations under the Notes will receive proceeds on enforcement of security over the
Collateral only after the claims of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, and any
future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super priority basis in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, are satisfied.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” In addition, in connection with the Incurrence_
of certain Indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture to be secured on the Collateral, the Issuer may enter
into Additional Intercreditor Agreements in compliance with the Indenture on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Intercreditor
_Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound.”_

**_Security Documents; Enforcement of Security Interests_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of
the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into
by, among others, the relevant security provider, the Security Agent for itself and as agent for the secured parties
(and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by Italian law, also as Security Representative and legal
representative (mandatario con rappresentanza)), and, with respect to the Security Documents governed by
Italian law, the Trustee acting for itself and in its capacity as the Trustee under the Indenture and as common
representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the
Italian Civil Code. The Security Agent will also act in the name and on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the Security
Interests in favor of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests in the Collateral
until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests
with respect to the Notes may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) will have the right to enforce the
Security Interests in the name and on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. The Security Documents
will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the Security Agent (including in
its role as Security Representative). As a consequence of such contractual provisions and since the Holders are
not a party to the Security Documents, holders of the Notes will not, individually or collectively, be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent
(including in its role as Security Representative) or the Trustee (as applicable) under the Indenture. To the extent
permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture,
holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide instructions to the
Security Agent for the enforcement of the Security Interests. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will

207


-----

restrict the ability of the holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the
Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act in the
name and on behalf of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations, if any, in relation to the Security Interest in favor of such parties.

In the event that Holdco, the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees
_and the Collateral.”_

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain
exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all dividends,
distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of
the Collateral).

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be
deemed to have, appointed, also for the purposes of Article 1704 (mandato con rappresentanza) of the Italian
Civil Code, the Security Agent to act as its agent and mandatario con rappresentanza under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents.
Furthermore, each Holder will have deemed to have appointed the Security Agent as mandatario con
_rappresentanza pursuant to article 1704 of the Italian Civil Code to act on its behalf and as representative_
(rappresentante) pursuant to article 2414-bis of the Italian Civil Code. The creditors under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the Holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (if any) secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the
Security Agent under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (as applicable) to: (i) perform the duties
and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification,
amendment, confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or discharge expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent in its name and on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the
Holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to be bound by the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the provisions described under
“—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” (including, without limitation, the provisions
providing for foreclosure and release of the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including upon an
enforcement);

(2) authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered
into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements” and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and exercise their_
respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith;

(3) appointed and authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to give effect to the provisions in the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c. as common
representative (rappresentante comune) of the Holders pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code;

208


-----

(5) agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of UniCredit S.pA. as representative (rappresentante) of the
Holders for the purposes of Article 2414-bis, third paragraph of the Italian Civil Code; and

(6) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered
into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be released under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Security Interest in respect of
the share capital of the Issuer and, subsequent to the Post Completion Merger, the share capital of
MergerCo) to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction
subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not
violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock” or is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this_
clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable to a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing) unless the relevant
property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following
such transfer, sale or disposal;

applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) as permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests” or (other than the Security
Interest in respect of the share capital of the Issuer and, subsequent to the Post Completion Merger, the share
capital of MergerCo) “—Merger and Consolidation;”

(7) in connection with the Post Completion Merger with respect to Security Interests over the Completion Date

Merger Collateral is granted or reconfirmed, as the case may be, as described under “—Security—General”),
and in connection with one or more Permitted Reorganizations;

(8) in the case of any Security Interests over intra-group receivables, upon partial repayment or discharge
thereof, the Security Interests created over such receivables will be automatically reduced in proportion to
such partial repayment or discharge and, upon full repayment or discharge thereof, the Security Interests
shall be automatically and fully released and of no further effect;

(9) upon the contribution of any claim against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which is subject to a
Lien, to the equity of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that, such contribution is
made in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including, following consummation of the
Post Completion Merger, in connection with an IPO pushdown as described under “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or transfer of claims and liabilities in respect_
_of the Notes and the Transaction Security—Provisions following an IPO”)._

209


-----

The Security Agent and the Trustee will, upon request (and at the cost and expense) of the Issuer, take all
necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Security Document, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of
the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders (except to
the extent required under clause (3) above) or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall
be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate
(with effect from the date specified in such notice and provided that such date falls on or after the date on which
the Post Completion Merger is completed) as described in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or transfer of claims and liabilities in respect of the Notes and the_
_Transaction Security—Provisions following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required (at_
the expense of the Issuer) to enter into any amendment to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents required by the Issuer and/or take such other
action as is required by the Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by this
paragraph; provided that such amendment or other such actions will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There are circumstances other than the repayment or_
_discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be released automatically without your consent or the_
_consent of the Trustee or the Security Agent.”_

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption,” “—Post-Tender Redemption” and “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not_
redeemable until October 1, 2023.

On and after October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount), plus the applicable Step-up Premium, if any, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
redemption date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on October 1 of the years indicated
below:

At any time and from time to time prior to October 1, 2023, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice,
the Issuer may redeem in the aggregate up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated
after giving effect to any issuance of Additional Notes of the same series of Notes issued on the Issue Date) with
an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Issuer or any direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer, to the extent (in the case of an Equity Offering by a direct or indirect parent of the Issuer)
that such net cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the common equity capital of the Issuer or used to purchase
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer through an issuance of Capital Stock by the Issuer, at a
redemption price of 104.625% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to
or on the redemption date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount
of any Additional Notes of the same series of Notes issued on the Issue Date) remains outstanding

210


-----

immediately after each such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture concurrently with or following the Equity Offering); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time and from time to time prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may, at its option, during each twelvemonth period commencing on the Issue Date, redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes
(including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes of the same series of Notes issued on the Issue
Date), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal
amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

In addition, prior to October 1, 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes, plus the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

_General_

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes, any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent. If such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, the notice of redemption shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice
may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date,
or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10
days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

**Sinking Fund**

Except as set forth above under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”, the Issuer is not
required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. The Issuer
or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may be made
through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or
exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer
or any such Affiliates may determine.

**Post-Tender Redemption**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, any series of Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable series of Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such series of Notes in such tender or other
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender or other offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of
the applicable series of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of
the applicable series of Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and, accordingly,
the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to
redeem the applicable series of Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase,

211


-----

at a price equal to the highest price (excluding any tender premium or similar payment) offered to each other
holder of the applicable series of Notes in such tender offer (provided that such price shall not be less than 100%
of the principal amount), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On October 1, 2026, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and
cancelled at 100% of their principal amount, plus the applicable Step-up Premium, if any, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or
on the redemption date).

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) will
select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under
_“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection in_
accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system), unless otherwise required by law or applicable
stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the
Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in accordance with the
prevailing rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption
may instead be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and may also be
delivered in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in lieu of the
aforesaid mailing.

If the Notes are to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Notes shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new
Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered
Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global
Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to
the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for
redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
redemption date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as
a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols, or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in position regarding the application, administration or written interpretation
of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses
(1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any successor entity) with respect to any Guarantee, as the
case may be, is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional

212


-----

Amounts (but in the case of any Guarantor, only if such amount payable cannot be paid by the Issuer or another
Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or such Guarantor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable).

Such Change in Tax Law must not have been publicly announced before and must become effective on or after
the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after
the Issue Date, such later date). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with
the procedures described under “Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of
redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below)
would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given,
such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any
notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Registrar, the Trustee
and the relevant Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been
satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or
the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event
it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors or a successor of the Issuer or
Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made
free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Italy or any political subdivision or governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made by or on behalf of a
Payor (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent), or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor under or
with respect to any Note or Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if
any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding,
deduction or imposition (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not
be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or
Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts
will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the existence
of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant
Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) or the beneficial
owner of a Note and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising
solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Indenture or any Guarantee in respect thereof;

(2) any Tax, to the extent that such Tax is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor, a Paying Agent, or other person
acting as an agent for the Payor or a Paying Agent, addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least
30 days before any such withholding is payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other

213


-----

evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make
any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is
required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of all or part of such
Tax;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest, if any, on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent in a member state of the European Union;

(6) any Taxes imposed, withheld or deducted pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (or any amended or successor version of such sections that is substantially
comparable) (the “Code”), any current or future regulations thereunder, official interpretations thereof or
agreements (including any intergovernmental agreement or any laws, rules or practices implementing such
intergovernmental agreement) entered into in connection therewith or otherwise pursuant to any agreements
described in Section 1471(b) of the Code;

(7) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are for or on account of imposta sostitutiva (pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree
**No. 239”)) and any related implementing regulations, or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of**
November 21, 1997, as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree No. 461”) and any related
implementing regulations, provided that:

(i) Additional Amounts shall be payable in circumstances where the procedures required under Decree
No. 239 or Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption from imposta sostitutiva have not
been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Payor or their agents; and

(ii) for the avoidance of doubt, (A) no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to any Taxes to
the extent that such Taxes result from payment to a non-Italian resident legal entity or a non-Italian
resident individual which is subject to imposta sostitutiva by reason of not being resident in a country
which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (the “White List”) and (B) no
Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to Taxes to the extent such Taxes are for or on
account of imposta sostitutiva if the Holder becomes subject to imposta sostitutiva after the Issue Date
by reason of any change in Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 or any change in the White List; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the
Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such Tax resulting in Additional
Amounts would not have been imposed or such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of
Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies as soon as
reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will
be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each such certified copy of such
payments a certificate stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so
payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders
on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to

214


-----

the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as
practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of Notes” there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal,

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or a purchase of Notes,

(3) interest, or

(4) any other amount payable under or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges
or levies (including any related interest, penalties and any other reasonable expenses with respect thereto) or any
other excise, property or similar Taxes (including any related interest, penalties and any other reasonable
expenses with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery,
registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (other than in each case, (A) in connection with a transfer of the Notes after the Issue Date or (B) to the
extent that such stamp, issue registration court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar
taxes or similar charges or levies becomes payable upon a voluntary registration made by the Holder if such
registration is not required by any applicable law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any
Holder in relation to the Notes, any Guarantees, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto), and
the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, and any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized, incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes or any
Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency
thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “—Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or_
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in
whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall
not be obliged to repurchase the Notes as described under this heading, “—Change of Control,” in the event and
to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied
or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the
“Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of the Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest
on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the repurchase date) (the “Change of Control
**Payment”);**

215


-----

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that
any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow
in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so
tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount
of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order
to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by
the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal
amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such
exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date in a newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg
(which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post
such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such
Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer or repurchase any Notes as described under
this heading “—Change of Control” upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control
Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption with respect to the Notes has been
given pursuant to the Indenture as defined under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in
payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation
of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time
the Change of Control Offer is made.

216


-----

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer
may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control
Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described
above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of
the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding
the date of redemption.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a
mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or
its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or
require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of
their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of,
such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on
the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the
Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including financial resources of its Restricted Subsidiaries. There can
be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuer may not be able to
_repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset disposition offer. In addition, under_
_certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a_
_tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as
to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) for the Relevant Testing Period, the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and
guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of €92.0 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in

aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such refinancing;

(a) guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed is permitted to be Incurred
under the terms of the Indenture; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to
the Notes or a Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantee to
the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason
of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture;


(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

nor a Guarantor, such Indebtedness (except in respect of intercompany liabilities Incurred in the
ordinary course of business or in connection with cash pooling or cash management or tax positions of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) is (subject to the Agreed Security Principles and if and to the
extent required by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) unsecured and (if and to the extent
required by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and only to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the reasonable judgment of
directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or
criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness)), expressly subordinated
to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer,
or the applicable Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and
any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not
permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4)

(a) (x) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the related Guarantees
and any related “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, and (y) any “parallel debt” obligations related to any other Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred pursuant to the Indenture;

(b) an amount equal to any Indebtedness of the Target Group outstanding on the Completion Date after
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving
Credit Facility on the Completion Date (if any) or described in clause (4)(a) of this paragraph);

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clause (4)(a), (4)(b), this

(b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate a transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which (i) any Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) any assets are acquired and related liabilities are assumed by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause
(5) is in an aggregate amount then outstanding not to exceed (I) the greater of €23.0 million and 25% of
Consolidated EBITDA, plus (II) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving pro forma
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness, either (A) the

used for such purposes (provided that, in each case under this clause (B), such Indebtedness exists on the
date of such purchase, lease, rental, design, construction, installation or improvement, as applicable, or is
created within 365 days thereafter), in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken
together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7)(a) and then
outstanding, will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of €27.5 million and 30% of Consolidated
EBITDA; (b) in respect of Sale and Leaseback Transactions and any Indebtedness which refinances,
replaces, refunds or reimburses such Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this sub-clause (b); or (c) consisting

types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its

220


-----

sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only
be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the
clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be
deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be
reclassified;

(3) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any provision of this covenant or secured
pursuant to the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Liens” shall be deemed to include all
amounts necessary to renew, refund, redeem, refinance, replace, restructure, defease or discharge any
such Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions, including after giving effect to
additional Indebtedness in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts,
premia, tax gross-up amounts and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such renewal,
refund, redemption, refinancing, replacement, restructuring, defeasance or discharge. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this covenant or any provision of the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on
_Liens,” the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur and/or secure_
pursuant to this covenant and/or the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens” shall not be deemed
to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations
in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such
Lien will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such
refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue);

(4) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),
(11), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness (a) issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP and (b) shall be
the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness;

(9) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness (including
interest paid in kind), the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or
Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness
due to a change in GAAP will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the
covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness;” and

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (30) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” or any Permitted Collateral
Lien, the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or use of clauses
(1) through (15) of the preceding paragraph for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and
including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the
Issuer’s option, either: (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into
or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date)
or other Indebtedness, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio

221


-----

or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the
Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and
the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted
under this covenant and under “—Limitation on Liens” irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or
issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or re-borrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
**Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Leverage**
Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the
Indenture, and, to the extent the usage of clauses (1) through (15) of the preceding paragraph, shall be
deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such
amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and, in each case, the
Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default
of this covenant).

Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial Calculations” below, for purposes of determining compliance
with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal
amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first
committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred
under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the
definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the euro equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
(i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Issue Date and (ii) of the Target Group outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering
principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be
adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. Subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial
_Calculations” below, the principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if_
Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that
is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or
junior Lien basis.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any

instalment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase,

clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”));

defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than any

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person

succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

If any Investment or Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) would be permitted pursuant to one or more
provisions described in this covenant and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of
“Permitted Payment” or “Permitted Investment” (or any other definition used in this covenant or such
definitions), the Issuer may, at its sole discretion, divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment in
any manner that complies with this covenant or such definition and may later reclassify in whole or in part any
such Investment or Restricted Payment (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) in
whole or in part at any time, so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so reclassified) would be
permitted to be made in reliance on the applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any
cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment
shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors or an Officer acting in good faith. For purposes of
this covenant, the fair market value of property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be measured at the time received and shall not give effect to subsequent changes in
value.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether
owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom,
which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or
asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not
Permitted Liens if the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are directly secured, at least equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates or (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing such Indebtedness.

227


-----

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, prior to the Release, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien securing any Indebtedness
over the Escrow Account or the Escrowed Property, in each case other than Liens (x) granted to secure the
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture or (y) described in
clause (1) of the definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens.”

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock or other common equity interests and (y) the
subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility),
the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents, the Escrow Charge and the security documents relating to the
Revolving Credit Facility, (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case in effect at or entered into on
the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, or (c) any other agreement or instrument
with respect to the Target Group in effect at or entered into on the Completion Date;

Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by
or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or was
designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined
with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the
Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement
or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument (a) are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management) or (b) are customary in comparable financings and where, in the case of this sub-clause (b),
the Issuer determines at the time of incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions
would not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management);

228

mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations

acquired in the nature of clause (C) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant
to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital
Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all
or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that
are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,

covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility,
together with the security documents associated therewith, the Escrow Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement, together with the Security Documents associated therewith, in each case, as in effect on the
Issue Date (or, with respect to the Security Documents, the Completion Date) or (ii) as is customary in
comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or
(B) the Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management, are necessary or advisable to
effect such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that

(x) the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds.”
Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or other Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available
Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause
(8) above has been entered into), or such earlier time as the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds the greater of €18.5 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer will be required
within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent
the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal
amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the
case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and additional tax gross-up amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof in the case of Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any other purpose, subject to other
covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be repaid or repurchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal
amounts into their euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency
other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually
received by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion of the Net Available
Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than five
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business

231


-----

Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required
to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered
in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a
_pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness_
or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for
payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the
Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase,
and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or
deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to
any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount
with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or
transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any such compliance. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters
issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a
tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of €9.0 million
and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €23.0 million
and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been
approved or ratified by a resolution of the majority of the Board of Directors resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the second_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitations on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2) and (11) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Capital Stock, options, other equityrelated interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise
pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective
bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and

other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer,
any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation,

arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved
or ratified by the Board of Directors;

(3) any Management Advances or Parent Expenses and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any
Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether
directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors,
officers or employees);

(6) (a) the Transactions; (b) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement or any transaction pursuant to or contemplated
by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or
on the Completion Date or described in this Offering Memorandum under “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions,” as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified,_
supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other
terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect (as
determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors or any direct or indirect Parent
of the Issuer); and (c) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement or payment
pursuant to which the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is required or permitted
to file a consolidated or combined tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group
for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in
the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such
time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or
an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any
Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of
the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding
are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination;
(b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in
compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; and (c) entering into of any loan or the receipt by the Issuer of other
contribution of proceeds of any Incurrence of indebtedness by a Parent and any amendment or modification
thereof or the pledging of such loan or any Capital Stock of the Issuer and any transactions relating thereto;

(11) (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or

any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any
Parent) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other
investment banking activities (including, in each case, related costs, taxes and expenses), including in
connection with loans, capital market transactions, private placements, acquisitions or divestitures, joint
ventures or other investments, which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of
this clause (11)(b) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

-----

Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (a) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (b) on terms not materially less favorable than those that could
reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a
Person that is not an Affiliate;

(13) any contribution to the equity of the Issuer in exchange for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock) or any investments by any Permitted Holders in securities of any Restricted Subsidiary

as (i) the investment complies with clause (1) of the preceding paragraph, (ii) non Affiliates were also
offered the opportunity to invest in such Indebtedness or Preferred Stock on the same or more favorable
terms and (iii) in the case of securities, the investment constitutes less than 5% of the issue amount of such
securities, and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Preferred
Stock of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such transaction is with all holders of such class
(and there are such non Affiliate holders) and such Affiliates are treated no more favorably than all other
holders of such class generally.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31,
2021, and within 120 days after the end of each of the Issuer’s fiscal years thereafter, annual reports
containing: (i) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion
of the financial condition, results of operations and consolidated EBITDA and a discussion of liquidity and
capital resources, material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies of the Issuer;
(ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless
such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below);
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense or burden, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the
most recent fiscal year with comparative balance sheet information as at the end of the prior fiscal year and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two
fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal
years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (iv) a description of the
management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all
material debt instruments; and (v) a description of material risk factors and material subsequent events;
_provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided in the footnotes to the_
audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2021, March 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022, 90 days) following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Issuer, beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2021, quarterly financial statements containing the
following information: (i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such
quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter end
year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period,
together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to
which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided
only to the extent available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide,
in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iii) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations,
consolidated EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; and

234


-----

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer or any other material event that the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective
investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons
who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant on the Issuer’s website and, if and so
long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on
the Euro MTF Market and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, copies of such reports will also be made available on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s Consolidated EBITDA for the
Relevant Testing Period tested after giving effect to such transaction in the case of an acquisition and prior to
giving effect to such transaction in the case of a disposition.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of GAAP as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for
the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in GAAP, present earlier periods
on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or any
Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or
statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above
will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would (if it were restricted) constitute a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first
paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

Furthermore, the Issuer shall, in connection with the delivery of the reports set forth in clauses (1) and (2) of this
covenant, use commercially reasonable efforts to hold a conference call (or cause a conference call to be held) to
discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer or any Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed
with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or
information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the
Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent, as
applicable, is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon
complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

With respect to periods commencing prior to the Completion Date, to the extent comparable prior period
financial information of the Issuer does not exist, the comparable prior period financial information of the Target
or special purpose financial information of the Issuer (incorporating such financial information of the Target)
may be provided in lieu thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial
statements of the Issuer under this covenant by providing any financial statements or reports of any Parent or the

235


-----

Target, in which case references to the Issuer in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph hereof will be
deemed to be references to such Parent or the Target, as applicable.

To the extent that material differences exist between the financial condition or results of operations of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Parent that is the reporting entity or the Target (as the case may be), the
annual and quarterly reports shall include a reasonably detailed explanation of such material differences.

If and for so long as the equity securities of the Issuer, any Parent or IPO Entity are listed on Borsa Italiana or any
other internationally recognized stock exchange and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the
admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on any such
internationally recognized stock exchange, for so long as it elects, the Issuer will be entitled to deliver to the Trustee
such annual and quarterly reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO
Entity is, or would be, required to file with such internationally recognized stock exchange. Upon complying with
the foregoing sentence, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs in this covenant; provided that if such internationally recognized stock exchange does not require the
Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file quarterly reports with such internationally recognized stock
exchange, the Issuer shall additionally provide the reports set forth in paragraph (2) above.

Delivery of any reports, information and documents to the Trustee pursuant to this section will be for
informational purposes only, and the Trustee’s receipt thereof shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer’s
compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or documents related thereto.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions to, any Person (other than in connection with the Post Completion Merger), unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
**Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of a Permissible Jurisdiction, the United**
Kingdom, the United States of America, any State of the United States of America or the District of
Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not
the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if
the same had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor
Company, as applicable, would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Company, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture
and that all conditions precedent provided for therein relating to such transaction have been complied with
or satisfied, and that the assumption (if any) of obligations under clause (1) above constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Successor Company and that the supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and inding agreement enforceable against the
Successor Company in accordance with its terms, provided that in giving any Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively
on such Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be
Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction

236


-----

undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset_
Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and other than in connection
with the Post Completion Merger) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety
or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture
(pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee) and all obligations of that Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; and

(C) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and is continuing; or

(D) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case
other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this covenant shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with clauses (A) or (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of
any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or
another Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or

237


-----

consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, if any, to which it
is a party, and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (iv) the Post
Completion Merger; and (v) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an
Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating
such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that (other than
in respect of the Post Completion Merger) clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” and clause
(3) (other than clause (3)(B)(2)) under the heading “—Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such
transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Post Completion Merger and Further Assurances_**

The Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to any relevant approval and/or authorization by
any competent authority, to implement the Post Completion Merger in accordance with Articles 2501-bis and
following of the Italian Civil Code and other applicable provisions of Italian law, with MergerCo being the
surviving entity, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Completion Date. Failure to complete the Post
Completion Merger shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture. The Post
Completion Merger is subject to certain conditions and may not be completed. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Structure and the Financing—We may be unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the_
_anticipated time frame, or at all.”_

Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note will be deemed to agree, for the purposes of Article 2503-bis (et
seq.) of the Italian Civil Code, to the consummation of the Post Completion Merger and, in the event that the
Target or Itelyum Regeneration is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, the assumption by
MergerCo of all obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the relevant Security Documents in accordance with the terms of the Indenture upon completion of the Post
Completion Merger.

In the event the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, the Issuer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to procure that (i) the Guarantors guarantee the Notes and (ii) the Notes are
secured by security interests granted on a first-priority basis over the Target Group Collateral, in each case,
within 90 days of the Cut-Off Date and subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain significant
limitations pursuant to applicable laws as described under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to_
_the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_their validity and enforceability.”_

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
**Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:**
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation on Restrictions on
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—Limitation on Sales of_
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under_
“—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” “—Impairment of Security Interests” and the second, third and
fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” and, in each case, any related default provision
of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to Holdco, the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as applicable. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their
terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be
of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event,
and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” covenant and the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted_
Subsidiary” will be interpreted as if they have been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the

238


-----

continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of
the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any_
continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6)(b) of the second
paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” and (b) any encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any continuance of a Suspension Event shall be deemed to_
be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on
which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered
into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade
Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interests_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and Holdco shall not, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to
the Collateral), and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, and Holdco shall not
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (1) the Issuer, its Restricted
Subsidiaries and Holdco may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace
any Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (2) the Collateral may be
discharged or released or released and retaken in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and (3) the applicable
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified,
replaced or released and retaken, from time to time (i) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest
error or inconsistency therein, (ii) to comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) to add Collateral, (iv) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or
any Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation,” (v) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a_
successor Trustee or Security Agent, (vi) to effect any Permitted Reorganizations or the Post Completion Merger
or (vii) in any manner that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that,
except with respect to any discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement or modification,
replacement, release or release and retaking in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly
permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including
for the avoidance of doubt, clause (3) above), the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such
action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (i) a solvency opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from
an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the relevant Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, (ii) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant
Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or
replacement, or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise

239


-----

subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall guarantee the
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility
with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of €5.0 million or any Public Debt, unless such
Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such guarantee is Incurred and, if
applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture
pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted
Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of
such Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or
violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous
restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case
of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or
(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability
to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally)
or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Releases of the
_Guarantees.” A Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of_
such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue
Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been
designated as a Guarantor, or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred
after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of
such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security
Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance
with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives)
an intercreditor agreement or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor
Agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same
terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of Security Interests; provided that such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or,
in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement; it being
understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subject to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to be on substantially
similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights of the Holders
and will be permitted by this provision if, in each case, the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (and any Lien in its
favor) is permitted by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Limitation on
_Liens.”_

240


-----

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest
error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any
such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add
Restricted Subsidiaries or Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the
Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other
change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall
not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, except as otherwise permitted below under
“—Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into
any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect their
respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices, or the offices of the
Trustee.

**_Issuer Activities Prior to Post Completion Merger_**

The Indenture will provide that, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer may not engage in any business
trading activities or own any assets or Incur any Indebtedness, other than:

(1) (i) the entry into and performance of rights and obligations under and in connection with the Transactions,

connection therewith);

(7) administrative, managerial, legal, treasury and accounting services, arrangements with shareholders and the

(11) other transactions, activities and arrangements related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or

**_Financial Calculations_**

When determining or calculating the availability under any basket, threshold or ratio under the Indenture in
connection with any transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any Incurrence or
assumption of Indebtedness (including any Reserved Indebtedness Amount) or Liens, a Change of Control, the
making of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment, any Asset Disposition, any acquisition,
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination and any other transaction requiring the
testing of any basket or threshold based on the Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer), the date of determination of
such basket, threshold or ratio or the testing of any such transaction and of any Default or Event of Default shall,
at the option of the Issuer, be (A) the date the definitive agreements for such transaction are entered into, the date
of the relevant offer, notice or commitment or any other date (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of Senior Management) on which the definitive terms of such transaction are established
(any such date, the “Transaction Commitment Date”), and such baskets, thresholds or ratios shall be calculated
with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the

242


-----

definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such
transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for
purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket, threshold or ratio); provided that the Issuer may elect to redetermine compliance with
the Indenture in respect of the relevant transaction on any date on or prior to the date of its consummation, (but
following the Transaction Commitment Date), in which case such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the
Transaction Commitment Date in respect of the relevant transaction, or (B) the date of consummation of any
such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if any of such baskets, thresholds or ratios are determined to be in
compliance under sub-clause (A) above: (x) if such baskets, thresholds or ratios are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such baskets, thresholds or ratios (including due to fluctuations in the Indebtedness, Consolidated
Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or a business, asset or target company subject to such
transaction) subsequent to the Transaction Commitment Date and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
transaction, such baskets, thresholds or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted hereunder; (y) such baskets,
thresholds or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related transactions;
and (z) any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall
be deemed to have occurred on the Transaction Commitment Date for purposes of calculating any baskets,
thresholds or ratios under the Indenture after the Transaction Commitment Date and before the earlier of the date
of consummation of such transaction or the date such transaction is terminated or expires without consummation,
except that in the case of an acquisition, merger or consolidation, any calculation of Consolidated Net Income or
Consolidated EBITDA for purposes other than Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or the making of Restricted
Payments (not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall not reflect such transaction until it has
been consummated.

Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, for any relevant financial covenant or financial ratio or Incurrencebased permission, test, basket or threshold in the Indenture (each, an “Applicable Metric”) set by reference to a
fiscal year, a calendar year, a four-quarter period (including Relevant Testing Period) or any other similar annual
period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the
permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied
by the Issuer during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal
to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such
immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back
**Amount”); and**

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount;
(B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in
accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

**_Events of Default_**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, which
continues for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or, solely in connection with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests,” Holdco, to comply for 60 days
after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with
their respective agreements contained in the Indenture (other than a default in performance or breach of a
covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1) or (2) above);

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted

243


-----

Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other
than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or guarantee
now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates €18.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Holdco, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer or any other applicable reporting entity under the covenant described under
“—Certain _Covenants—Reports”),_ would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy
**provisions”);**

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or any
other applicable reporting entity under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports”),
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €18.0 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than (i) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture or (ii) caused by the action or inaction of the
Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of €9.0 million for
any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such
Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any Security Interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or Holdco, as applicable, shall assert in writing that any such
Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with
the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial
proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such
Default continues for 10 days.

However, a Default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify
the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such Default within
the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under
the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders
shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the
Indenture to be due and payable.

Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable
immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave
rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except
non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of
the Notes, have been cured or waived.

244


-----

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the applicable Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by
notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default
(except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, which may
only be waived with the consent of Holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding aggregate principal
amount of Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
(including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue
the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability
or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer
of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to
use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is
unduly prejudicial to the holders of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior
to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security
satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
The Indenture will provide that if a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60
days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium,
if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of
the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal
year ending after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any
Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the
Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which
would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed

245


-----

in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such
covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only
if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the
Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for
Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions and subject to compliance with the provisions described in “—Meetings of Holders
_of Notes” below, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent_
of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes); provided that (x) if any such
amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one series of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then
outstanding under the Indenture, then only the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of
the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such
amendment, supplement or waiver by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner that is different from and
materially adverse relative to the manner in which such amendment, supplement or waiver affects other series of
Notes, then the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then
outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall also be required. However, without the consent of Holders
holding not less than 75% of the principal amount of the Notes affected then outstanding, an amendment or
waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case, as described above under “—Optional Redemption;”

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to
such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a
way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any of the Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of such Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any of the Guarantors from any of their obligations under their respective Guarantees or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence,

246


-----

_provided that (x) if any such amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one series of Notes (or less than_
all series of Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture and does not or would not affect holders of the Notes
generally, then only the consent of the holders of not less than 75% in principal amount of the Notes of such
series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment,
supplement or waiver by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner that is different from and materially
adverse relative to the manner in which such amendment, supplement or waiver affects other series of Notes,
then the consent of the Holders of not less than 75% in principal amount of the Notes of such series then
outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall also be required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of any series of Notes, the Issuer, any
Guarantor, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement
any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under
the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of
Senior Management) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Indebtedness”_ or “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_
_Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes,_
or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to
or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for
under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision
of this “Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to
the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or the Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Lien in favor of the
Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility, in any property
which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue
Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is required to be granted to the Security
Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Lien in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that
the granting of such Lien is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interests” is complied with; or_

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” or “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interests.”_

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment pursuant to
subsections (3) and (6) in respect of providing for a Guarantee, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental
indenture or Guarantee of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such
additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee.

247


-----

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in
connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such
exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in
a newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such
notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its, its Restricted Subsidiaries’ and Holdco’s obligations under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under “—Events of Default,” the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the
cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries,
the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under
“—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant
Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with
certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal

248


-----

defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either
defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for
in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all such Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all such Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee
(or another entity directed, selected or designated by the Trustee for this purpose), euro or euro-denominated
European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be
paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee, the Paying Agent or other entity directed, designated or selected by the Trustee, as applicable, to apply
the funds deposited towards the payment of such Notes at Stated Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case
may be; provided that, if requested by the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or other entity directed,
designated or selected by the Trustee, as applicable, may distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders
prior to the maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be, provided, however, that the Holders shall have
received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which notice may be
contained in the notice of redemption); and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with,
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to_
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payments to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as
set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any other premium
on such amounts. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be liable to any Person for the distribution of funds
to Holders early as described in such paragraph.

**Meetings of Holders of Notes**

All meetings of Holders of the Notes will be held in accordance with Italian applicable laws and regulations.

In addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described above under “—Amendments and Waivers,” in
accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil Code, the Indenture will include provisions for the
convening of meetings of the Holders of the Notes to consider any matter affecting their interests, including,
without limitation, the modification or abrogation by extraordinary resolution of any provisions of the Notes or
the Indenture. A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, (ii) by the
Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least 5.0% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of the Holders of
Notes will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of more than

249


-----

one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any
further adjourned meeting, one or more persons that hold or represent Holders of at least two-thirds of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or further
adjourned meeting will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or represent Holders of
more than one-third of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes; provided, however, that the
Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the extent permitted under Italian law). Certain proposals,
as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item 2, and paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the
amendment of the economic terms and conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary
resolution passed at a meeting of Holders of the Notes (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons
present that hold or represent holders of not less than one-half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and to the
extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase the percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of the Italian Civil Code to pass an extraordinary
resolution with respect to such matters from 50% to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuer may amend
_the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all noteholders with the vote of_
_either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.” Any resolution duly passed at_
any such meeting shall be binding on all the holders of the Notes, whether or not such holder was present at such
meeting or voted to approve such resolution. To the extent provided by the Italian Civil Code, the resolutions
passed by a meeting of Holders of the Notes can be challenged by Holders pursuant to Articles 2377 and 2379 of
the Italian Civil Code.

The Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” will be in
addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers.” As such and
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to complying with the
provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” must also comply with the other provisions
described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative**

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes
on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the holders of the
Notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of UniCredit S.p.A., as representative (rappresentante)
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security Representative”) in order to
create and grant in its favor security interests and guarantees securing and guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to
exercise in the name and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes all their rights (including any rights before any
court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security interests and guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture each holder of the Notes from time to time, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to,
and accepted, the appointment of UniCredit S.p.A., as Security Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the Holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the “Noteholders’
**Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the Italian Civil Code by the Holders**
of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2418 of the Italian
Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Holders of the Notes. Pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes on the Issue
Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the holders of the Notes of the
initial appointment as of the Issue Date of The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c. as the Noteholders’
Representative. If the Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of the Holders of the Notes, the
Noteholders’ Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the Court where the Issuer has its registered office
upon request by one or more Holders of the Notes or upon request by the directors of the Issuer. The
Noteholders’ Representative remains appointed for a maximum period of three financial years but may be
subsequently reappointed thereafter.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their

250


-----

creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c. is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During
the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee
will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the
Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for certain losses, liabilities and
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be published on the official
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly
given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained
by the Registrar. However, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the
Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable, in lieu of the aforesaid mailing. Such notices may instead be published by the
Issuer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger
_Wort) or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper_
having general circulation in Europe.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

251


-----

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under
or in connection with the Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount
received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will
only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which
the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of
that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the
Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a
joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase.

For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein
for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a
separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note
or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any
Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, subject to the provisions set forth in “—Financial Calculations”
above, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the euro equivalent
amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness,
or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower euro equivalent) or made, as the case may be.

judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to
the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York,

Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) subsequent to the commencement of the
Relevant Testing Period but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is made (the “CNLR Calculation Date”) or has caused any Reserved
Indebtedness Amount to be deemed to be Incurred during such period, then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio

_forma effect as if they had occurred on the first day of the Relevant Testing Period; provided that, if_
definitive documentation has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction
causing a calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such Relevant Testing Period will be
calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Purchase as if such Purchase had occurred on the first day of
such Relevant Testing Period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date of
determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with GAAP, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business

Temporary Cash Investments received in connection with a subsequent payment, redemption, retirement, sale or
other disposition of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration. A particular item of Designated Non-Cash

repurchase or redeem any such Capital Stock pursuant to such provisions unless such repurchase or redemption
would not be prohibited under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” For purposes hereof,
the amount of Disqualified Stock which does not have a fixed repurchase price shall be calculated in accordance
with the terms of such Disqualified Stock as if such Disqualified Stock were purchased on any date on which
Indebtedness shall be required to be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is based upon, or

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

Certain defined terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture as
described in “Description of Notes.”

The Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf
of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator
of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered in the
name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

The Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”) under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common
Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the
Common Depositary.

Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered global form in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of the Offering
only against payment in immediately available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Restricted BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable
transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture governing the Notes and any applicable securities laws of any state of
the United States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to
own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of BookEntry Interests will not be considered the “holders” of Notes for any purpose under the Indenture.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its
nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream
and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any
rights of holders under the Indenture.

The Notes will be issued in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common
Depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial
redemption, the Common Depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return
the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such

287


-----

partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to
prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no
Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will,
in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in
accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such
participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar
will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear or
Clearstream) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of
their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

 - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

 - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

 - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to
holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor
any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any
commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding
effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more
participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes (as defined under “Description of Notes—Events of Default”), each of Euroclear and
Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form
(the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

288


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be
subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect
participants, which rules and procedures may change from time to time and will be settled in immediately
available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,
including to sell the Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will each bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements as discussed in
_“Transfer Restrictions.”_

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of
the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any
other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Restricted
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions,” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. Transfers of interests in the Global
Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with
their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to
time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any
of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

289


-----

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes if:

 - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary for
the Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor depositary;

 - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

 - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is
to request that the Issuer issues or causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of BookEntry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in
any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or
applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer
Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered
Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in
respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as
applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees
normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee will authenticate a
replacement Definitive Registered Note if such Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer and
the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity
bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent
appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note
is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such
Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered
Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which we expect to be the Luxemburger Wort).
Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable
at the office of the paying agent in Luxembourg so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry system**

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of
any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day may
find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used,
or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing information_**

We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The
international securities identification numbers and Common Codes for the Notes are set out under “Listing and
_General Information.”_

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the
respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar take any responsibility for these operations and
procedures and we urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

_Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and_
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

_Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account_
_holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect_
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that,
under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry

291


-----

Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give
or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant BookEntry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or
take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the
Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the
Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the

the applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered
and sold only to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and outside the United States in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and
agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees are being offered for resale in a
transaction not involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the U.S. Securities
Act, that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or any other applicable securities law, and that if in the future it decides to offer, resell, pledge or
otherwise transfer any of the Notes, such Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred

acquisition of Notes will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(ii) it is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent,
the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing any of them, have made any
representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information contained in
this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is
relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial
Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. It has had access to
such financial and other information concerning us, the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Notes as it has
deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to
ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a
fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts beat all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to
resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available
under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”) agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Rule
144A Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Rule
144A Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year after the later of
the date of the Issue Date and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such
Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has
been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that
purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being
made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in

293


-----

compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, or (v) pursuant to any other available
exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing
cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account
or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities
laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s, the Trustee’s and the
Registrar’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require the delivery of
an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of
the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES
LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY
INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED,
PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO,

ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY
AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF
THIS SECURITY) ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, (B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO
LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”), TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A
“QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS
OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM
NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A,
(D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, OR (E) PURSUANT TO

ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL AND IN
COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND ANY APPLICABLE
LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S, THE
TRUSTEE’S AND THE REGISTRAR’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER, SALE OR

(9) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and
others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties

any Guarantor or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in
any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be
subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution.”

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice currently_
_applicable in the European Union, Italy and the United States and does not purport to address the tax_
_consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences_
_of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium paid (if_
_any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, European Union, Italian or United States law as in_
_effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that may take effect_
_after such date, also on a retroactive basis. References in this section to holders of the Notes include the_
_beneficial owners of the Notes. Terms defined under each subsection related to European Union, Italian and_
_United States tax law below only have such meanings as defined therein for such respective section. The_
_statements regarding the Italian and United States laws and practices set forth below assume that the Notes will_
_be issued, and the transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the Indenture._

**Certain Italian Tax Considerations**

The statements herein regarding Italian taxation are based on the laws and published practice of the Italian tax
authorities in effect in Italy as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any changes in law
occurring after such date, which changes could be made on a retroactive basis. The following is a summary only
of the material Italian tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes for Italian resident
and non-Italian resident beneficial owners, although it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be,
legal or tax advice. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax
considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes and does not purport
to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in
securities or commodities) may be subject to special rules. Neither the Issuer nor any other entity belonging to
the Itelyum Group will update this summary to reflect changes in law or in the interpretation thereof and, if any
such change occurs, the information in this summary could be superseded.

**_Tax treatment of interest_**

Decree No. 239 sets forth the applicable regime regarding the tax treatment of interest, premium and other
income (including the difference between the redemption amount and the issue price, hereinafter collectively
referred to as “Interest”) deriving from Notes falling within the category of bonds (obbligazioni) and similar
securities (pursuant to Article 44 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended and
supplemented (“Decree No. 917”)), issued, inter alia, by:

(a) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are listed on a regulated market or on a
multilateral trading platform of EU Member States or States party to the European Economic Area
Agreement (“EEA State”) allowing a satisfactory exchange of information with the Italian tax
authorities as included in (i) the Ministerial Decree of September 4, 1996 as subsequently amended and
supplemented or (ii) once effective, any other decree that will be issued in the future under Article
11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239 (any of such decrees, the “White List”); or

(b) companies resident of Italy for tax purposes whose shares are not listed, issuing notes traded
(negoziati) upon their issuance on the aforementioned regulated markets or platforms; or

(c) if not traded on the aforementioned markets or multilateral trading platforms, when such notes are held
by “qualified investors” pursuant to article 100 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24,
1998.

For these purposes, securities similar to bonds (titoli similari alle obbligazioni) are securities that incorporate an
unconditional obligation for the Issuer to actually pay, at maturity (or at any earlier redemption), an amount not
lower than their nominal/face value/principal and that do not provide any right of direct or indirect participation
in, or control on, the management of the Issuer or of the business in connection with which they are issued.

**_Italian-resident Noteholders_**

_Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Where an Italian-resident beneficial owner of the Notes (a “Noteholder”) is:

 - an individual not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected;

 - a non-commercial partnership (società semplice) or a professional association;

 - a non-commercial private or public institution (other than Italian undertakings for collective investment); or

 - an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation,

then Interest derived from the Notes, and accrued during the relevant holding period, is subject to a tax withheld
at source (imposta sostitutiva), levied at a rate of 26%, unless the relevant Noteholder holds the Notes in a
discretionary investment portfolio managed by an authorized intermediary and has validly opted for the
application of the risparmio gestito regime under Article 7 of Legislative Decree No. 461 (see also “—Tax
_treatment of capital gains—Discretionary investment portfolio regime (risparmio gestito regime)” below)._

Subject to certain conditions (including a minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest,
premium and other income relating to the Notes (being financial instruments issued by an Italian resident
corporation) may be exempt from any income taxation (including the 26% imposta sostitutiva) if the Noteholders
are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to
Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes
are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set
forth in Article 1(100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 (“Finance Act 2017”), as subsequently
amended and supplemented and/or in Article 13-bis of Law Decree No. 124 of October 26, 2019 converted into
Law No. 157 of December 19, 2019 (“Decree No. 124”), as subsequently amended and supplemented.

_Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

In the event that the Italian-resident Noteholders mentioned above are engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to
which the Notes are connected, the imposta sostitutiva applies as a provisional tax. Interest will be included in
the relevant beneficial owner’s Italian income tax return and will be subject to Italian ordinary income taxation
and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a deduction from Italian income tax due.

Where a Noteholder is an Italian-resident company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in
Italy of a non-Italian resident company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited
with an authorized intermediary, Interest from the Notes will not be subject to the imposta sostitutiva. Interest
must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and is therefore subject to general
Italian corporate income taxation (i.e. IRES and, if applicable, any relevant additional surcharge, such as the
additional 3.5% surcharge for banks and certain financial institutions) and, in certain circumstances, depending
on the status of the Noteholder and also to the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”) (i.e.,
generally in the case of banks and financial institutions).

Effective as of the fiscal year following the fiscal year that was current on December 31, 2015, Article 1(550) of
Finance Act 2017 added paragraph 6-bis to Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, converted
into Law No. 214 of December 22, 2011. Under this new rule, the base upon which the “Aiuto alla Crescita
**Economica” benefit set forth in Article 1 of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011 (“ACE Benefit”) is**
computed shall be reduced by an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (i) the aggregate book
value of securities (titoli e valori mobiliari), including the Notes, other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s
financial statements for the relevant fiscal year and (ii) the aggregate book value of securities (titoli e valori
_mobiliari) other than shares reported in the taxpayer’s financial statements of the fiscal year that was current on_
December 31, 2010. Only Italian resident persons carrying on an entrepreneurial activity (such as the Italian
resident corporations) and Italian permanent establishments of non-Italian resident persons can enjoy the ACE
Benefit. The new restrictive rule enacted by Finance Act 2017 applies only to taxpayers different from those
carrying out financial and insurance activities falling into section K of the ATECO classification of economic
activities, other than non-financial holding companies.

_Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_

Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate investment funds and real estate
closed-ended investment companies (società di investimento a capitale fisso, or “SICAFs”), provided that the
Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Italian
authorized financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediary) are
subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or
the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to
income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or
shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real
estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders irrespective of any actual
distribution on a tax transparency basis.

_Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_

If an Italian resident Noteholder is a non-real estate open-ended or a closed-ended collective investment fund
(“Fund”) or an open-ended investment company (società di investimento a capitale variabile, or “SICAVs”) or a
non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF or
(ii) their manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an
authorized intermediary, Interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to imposta
_sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF._
The Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other
income tax at their level, but a withholding tax of 26% will be levied, in certain circumstances, by the Fund, the
non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV on proceeds distributed in favor of their unitholders or shareholders.

_Pension funds_

If an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian
Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an authorized intermediary,
Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but
must be included in the results of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period (which will be subject
to a 20% substitute tax). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and
limitations, Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the
Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the
requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017, as subsequently amended and supplemented
and/or in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 124, as subsequently amended and supplemented.

_Application of the imposta sostitutiva_

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, brokerage companies (società di
_intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio (“SGR”),_
stockbrokers and other entities identified by decrees of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (each, an
“Intermediary”).

An Intermediary must:

(a) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial
intermediary; and

(b) participate, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of
the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act,
either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in
a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited.

If the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the
relevant Italian financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial
intermediary) paying the Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian
resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes
are effectively connected are entitled to deduct imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

If the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident for tax purposes (without a permanent establishment in Italy to which
the Notes are effectively connected), an exemption from the imposta sostitutiva applies, provided that the
non-Italian resident Noteholder is:

(a) a beneficial owner of the payment of Interest and resident, for tax purposes, in a state or territory
included in the White List; or

(b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered
into force in Italy; or

(c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory
included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of
establishment; or

(d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must promptly deposit the Notes together with
the coupons relating to such Notes directly or indirectly with:

(i) an Italian or non-Italian resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the bank or
financial institution to be an EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the deposit of
the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as defined below); or

(ii) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM,
acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct relationships, via telematic
link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (the “Second Level Bank”).
Organizations and companies that are not resident of Italy, acting through a system of centralized
administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the Italian Ministry
of Economy and Finance (which include Euroclear and Clearstream) are treated as Second Level Banks,
provided that they appoint an Italian representative (an Italian resident bank or SIM, or the permanent
establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM, or a central depositary of financial instruments
pursuant to Article 80 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998) for the purposes of the
application of Decree No. 239. If a non-Italian resident Noteholder deposits the Notes directly with a
Second Level Bank, the latter shall be treated both as a First Level Bank and a Second Level Bank.

The exemption from the imposta sostitutiva for non-Italian resident Noteholders is conditional upon:

(i) the deposit of the Notes, either directly or indirectly, with an institution which qualifies as a Second Level
Bank; and

(ii) the submission to the First Level Bank or the Second Level Bank (as the case may be) of a statement of the
relevant Noteholder (autocertificazione), to be provided only once, in which it declares, inter alia, that it is
eligible to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva.

Such statement must comply with the requirements set forth by a Ministerial Decree dated December 12, 2001, is
valid until withdrawn or revoked (unless some information provided therein has changed) and does not need to
be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document for the same or equivalent purposes was
previously submitted to the same depository. The above statement is not required for non-Italian resident
investors that are international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements entered into
force in Italy referred to in point b) above or Central Banks or entities also authorized to manage the official
reserves of a State referred to in point d) above. Additional requirements are provided for “institutional
**investors” referred to in point c) above (in this respect see Circular Letters No. 23/E of March 1, 2002 and No.**
20/E of March 27, 2003).

The imposta sostitutiva will be applicable at a rate of 26% to Interest paid to Noteholders who do not qualify for
the foregoing exemption or do not timely and properly satisfy the requested conditions (including the procedures
set forth under Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules). Noteholders who are subject to the
_imposta sostitutiva – might, nevertheless, be eligible for full or partial relief under an applicable tax treaty,_
subject to timely filing of required documentation provided by Regulation of the Director of Italian Revenue
Agency No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.

**_Tax treatment of capital gains_**

_Italian-resident Noteholders_

_Noteholders not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity. Where an Italian-resident Noteholder is an individual not_
engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, any capital gain realized by such
Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be subject to a capital gain tax (“CGT”) levied at a
rate of 26%. Noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains.

In respect of the application of CGT, taxpayers may opt-under certain conditions-for any of the three regimes
described below.

_Tax return regime (Regime della dichiarazione). Under the tax return regime, which is the default regime for_
Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT
on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss)
realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals
holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains
realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss, in their annual tax return, and pay the CGT on
such gains, together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Within the same time limit, capital losses
in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax
years.

_Nondiscretionary investment portfolio regime (risparmio amministrato regime). As an alternative to the tax_
return regime, Italian-resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial
activity may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes
(regime del risparmio amministrato). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to:

 - the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediaries (including
permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediaries); and

 - an express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in a timely fashion by the
relevant Noteholder.

The depository must account for the CGT in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the
Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred
capital loss. The depository must also pay the CGT to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder,
deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by
the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting
from a sale or redemption or certain other transfer of the Notes may be deducted from capital gains subsequently
realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years, up until the
fourth tax year. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital
gains/losses realized within said regime in the annual tax return.

_Discretionary investment portfolio regime (risparmio gestito regime). In the risparmio gestito regime, any capital_
gains realized by Italian-resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity
and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized
intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued,
even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized
intermediary. Any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at the tax year-end may be carried forward
against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. Under the
_risparmio gestito regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized within said_
regime in its annual tax return.

Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on
the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26% CGT) if the Noteholders are Italian
resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative
Decree No. 509 of June 30,1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes are included
in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in
Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017, as subsequently amended and supplemented and/or in Article 13-bis of
Decree No. 124, as subsequently amended and supplemented. According to Article 1 (219-225) of Law No. 178
of December 30, 2020, under some conditions, capital losses realized by Italian resident individuals not acting in
connection with an entrepreneurial activity upon sale or redemption of the Notes if the Notes are included in

300


-----

certain long-term savings accounts (piani di risparmio a lungo termine) governed by Decree No. 124 that meet
specific requirements, give rise to a tax credit equal to the capital losses, provided that such tax credit does not
exceed the 20% of the amount invested in the long-term saving accounts (piani di risparmio a lungo termine).

_Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_

Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes will be treated as part of taxable business income
(and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the
production for IRAP purposes), if realized by an Italian company, a similar commercial entity (including the
Italian permanent establishment of non-Italian resident entities to which the Notes are connected) or Italian
resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected.

_Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian real estate investment fund or an Italian
real estate SICAF will be subject neither to CGT nor to any income tax at the level of the real estate investment
fund or the Real Estate SICAF (see “Tax treatment of interest—Real estate investment funds and real estate
_SICAFs”). However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income_
realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares.

Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate
SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax
transparency basis.

_Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is a Fund, a SICAF (other than a real estate SICAF) or a
SICAV will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of
the relevant fiscal year. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the SICAF or the SICAV, but
income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units /
shares may be subject to a withholding tax of 26%.

_Pension funds_

Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime
provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will be included in the result of
the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to 20% substitute tax. Subject to
certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes
may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings
account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of
Finance Act 2017, as subsequently amended and supplemented and/or in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 124, as
subsequently amended and supplemented.

_Non-Italian resident Noteholders_

A 26% CGT on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized on the sale or redemption of the Notes by
non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively
connected, if the Notes are held in Italy.

However, under Article 23(1)(f)(2) of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders
from the sale or redemption of notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets (which
term includes, for these purposes, also certain multilateral trading facilities) in Italy or abroad are not subject to
the CGT, subject to the filing of required documentation in a timely fashion (in particular, a self-declaration that
the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes and has no permanent establishment in Italy to which the
Notes are effectively connected).

Capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an
Italian resident issuer, even if the Notes are not traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these
purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), are not subject to the CGT, provided that the beneficial owner is:

(a) a resident, for tax purposes, of a state or territory included in the White List; or

301


-----

(b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered
into force in Italy; or

(c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory
included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of
establishment; or

(d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state.

In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set forth
above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree No. 239 (see “—Tax
_treatment of interest”)._

If none of the above conditions is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or
the redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets (which term
includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), may be subject to the CGT at the current rate of
26%. However, Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains
realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the State where the recipient is tax
resident, subject to certain conditions to be satisfied.

Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which
the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject
to the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation
on capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents Noteholders file in time with the
authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from
the competent tax authorities of their country of residence.

The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident
persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the
right to waive this regime.

**_Certain reporting obligations for Italian-resident Noteholders_**

Under Law Decree No. 167 of June 28,1990, as subsequently amended and supplemented, individuals,
non-business entities and non-business partnerships that are resident in Italy and, during the tax year, hold
investments abroad or have financial assets abroad (including possibly the Notes) must, in certain circumstances,
disclose these investments or financial assets to the Italian tax authorities in their income tax return (or, in case
the income tax return is not due, in a proper form that must be filed within the same time as prescribed for the
income tax return), regardless of the value of such assets (save for deposits or bank accounts having an aggregate
value not exceeding €15.0 thousand threshold throughout the year, which per se do not require such disclosure).
The requirement applies also where the persons above, being not the direct holder of the financial assets, are the
actual economic owners thereof for the purposes of anti-money laundering legislation.

No disclosure requirements exist for investments and financial assets (including the Notes) under management or
administration entrusted to Italian resident intermediaries (Italian banks, SIMs, fiduciary companies or other
professional intermediaries, indicated in Article 1 of Decree No. 167 of June 28,1990) and for contracts
concluded through their intervention, provided that the cash flows and the income derived from such activities
and contracts have been subjected to Italian withholding or substitute tax by the such intermediaries.

**_Italian inheritance tax and gift tax_**

The transfer of Notes by reason of gift, donation or succession proceedings is subject to Italian gift and
inheritance tax as follows:

(a) 4% for transfers in favor of the spouse or direct relatives exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of
€1.0 million;

(b) 6% for transfers in favor of siblings exceeding, for each beneficiary, a threshold of €0.1 million;

(c) 6% for transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree and to all relatives in law indirect line and
to other relatives in law up to the third degree, on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift; and

(d) 8% for transfers in favor of any other person or entity, on the entire value of the inheritance or the gift.

302


-----

If the heir/heiress or the donee is a person with a severe disability pursuant to Law No. 104 of February 5, 1992,
inheritance tax or gift taxes applied to the extent that the value of the inheritance or gift exceeds €1.5 million.

With respect to Notes listed on regulated markets (including multilateral trading facilities), the value for
inheritance and gift tax purposes is the average stock exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the
succession or of the gift (including any accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance
tax and gift tax purposes is generally determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar
features or based on certain elements as presented in the Italian tax law.

The mortis causa transfer of financial instruments included in a long-term savings account (piano individuale di
_risparmio a lungo termine), that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017, as_
subsequently amended and supplemented and/or in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 124, as subsequently amended
and supplemented, is exempt from inheritance taxes.

Italian inheritance tax and gift tax applies to non-Italian resident individuals for bonds issued by Italian resident
companies.

**_Wealth tax on financial products held abroad-direct holding_**

According to Article 19(18) of Law Decree No. 201 of December 6, 2011, Italian resident individuals, Italian
non-commercial entities, Italian non-commercial partnerships and similar Italian resident entities holding
financial products, including the Notes, outside Italy without the involvement of an Italian financial intermediary
are required to pay a wealth tax currently at the rate of 0.2% (the level of tax being determined in proportion to
the period of ownership). The wealth tax applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year or, in the
absence of a market value, on the nominal value or redemption value of such financial products held outside Italy
by Italian-resident individual. Taxpayers are generally permitted to deduct from the wealth tax a tax credit equal
to any wealth taxes paid in the State where the financial products are held (up to the amount of the Italian wealth
tax due).

The wealth tax cannot exceed €14.0 thousand per year for Noteholders other than individuals.

The wealth tax is due only in relation to financial assets held outside the Italian territory (and not through an
Italian intermediary). If the Notes are held through Italian intermediaries, the rules described in subsection
“Stamp taxes and duties—holding through financial intermediary” apply.

**_Stamp taxes and duties-holding through financial intermediary_**

Under Article 13(2bis-2ter) of Decree No. 642 of October 26, 1972, a 0.2% stamp duty generally applies on
communications and reports that Italian financial intermediaries periodically send to their clients in relation to
the financial products that are deposited with such intermediaries. The Notes are included in the definition of
financial products for these purposes. Communications and reports are deemed to be sent at least once a year
even if the Italian financial intermediary is under no obligation to either draft or send such communications and
reports.

The stamp duty cannot exceed €14.0 thousand for Noteholders other than individuals.

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of Economy and
Finance on May 24, 2012, the 0.2% stamp duty does not apply to communications and reports that the Italian
financial intermediaries send to investors who do not qualify as “clients” according to the regulations issued by
the Bank of Italy. Communications and reports sent to this type of investors are subject to the ordinary €2.0
stamp duty for each copy.

The taxable base of the stamp duty is the market value or, in the lack thereof, the nominal value or the
redemption amount of any financial product.

**_Registration tax_**

Contracts relating to the transfer of the Notes are subject to the registration tax as follows:

(a) public deeds and private deeds with notarized signatures (atti pubblici e scritture private autenticate)
are subject to fixed registration tax of €200.0; and

303


-----

(b) private deeds (scritture private non autenticate) are subject to fixed registration tax of €200.0 only in
the case of use or voluntary registration or occurrence of the so-called enunciazione.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes (as defined in “Description of Notes”) under the Indenture. Any
Additional Notes will be considered fungible for Italian income tax purposes with the initial Notes issued under
the Indenture only if the conditions set forth in Article 11(2) of Decree No. 239 are met, which requires in
particular that (i) the issuance of Additional Notes occurs within 12 months of the original issue of the initial
Notes, and (ii) the spread between (a) the issue price of the initial Notes and (b) the issue price of the Additional
Notes is less than 1 percent of the principal amount of the issuance multiplied by the number of full years until
the maturity date. If these requirements are not met, the Additional Notes will not be considered fungible for
Italian income tax purposes with the initial Notes issued under the Indenture.

**_General-payments by a Guarantor_**

According to a certain interpretation, payments on the Notes made by an Italian resident Guarantor under a
Guarantee should be treated, in certain circumstances, as payment by the Issuer and should be subject to the tax
regime described above. However, there are no Italian tax authorities’ guidelines directly regarding the Italian tax
regime of payments on notes made by an Italian resident guarantor. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
the Italian tax authorities will not assert an alternative treatment of such payments or that the Italian courts would
not support such an alternative treatment.

In particular, according to a different interpretation, if a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on
the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of principal under the Notes), it is
possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, pursuant to Presidential
Decree No. 600 of September 29, 1973, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This
discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of
FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any
U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local
or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, and all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have
been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the
IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition
of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder
in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt
entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities
or arrangements and investors therein, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a
jurisdiction outside the United States persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any
item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In
addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their
“issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors) and who
hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity

304


-----

taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a
partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding
Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the U.S. federal
Medicare tax on net investment income and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.

_Transactions related to the Acquisition_

If the conditions for the Post Completion Merger are met, it is expected that the Issuer and the Target will merge
with Itelyum Regeneration, with MergerCo being the surviving entity. MergerCo, as the surviving entity, will
assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Post Completion Merger.”
Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to do so)
that these transactions will not constitute a significant modification of the Notes and therefore will not be treated
as resulting in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Post Completion Merger and
the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by MergerCo as resulting in a deemed exchange for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If such a position were taken and sustained, if the fair market value of the Notes at
the time of the Post Completion Merger is less than the principal amount of the “new” Notes (by more than a
statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, U.S. holders may recognize gain in connection with such
deemed exchange (although any loss could be disallowed) and would have a new holding period and new tax
basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them
of the Acquisition and the Post Completion Merger. The balance of the discussion below assumes that the Post
Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligation under the Notes by MergerCo will not be treated as a
deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Effect of the IPO Debt Pushdown provisions_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description of
_Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange of the Notes for_
“new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders generally would recognize any
gain on such exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the “new” Notes could be treated as issued
with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes—Sustainability Performance Targets Step-up Redemption
_Premium,”“Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” “Description of_
_Notes—Withholding Taxes,” and “Description of Notes—Change of Control”), the Issuer may be obligated to_
redeem the Notes for an amount less than their stated principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest), or may
be obligated to redeem the Notes or to make certain payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and
interest. It is possible that the IRS could assert that the payment of such excess amounts is a “contingent
payment,” and that the Notes are therefore contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Under the applicable Treasury Regulations, however, for purposes of determining whether a debt
instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument, remote or incidental contingencies (determined as of the date
the notes are issued) are ignored. The Issuer believes that the possibility of making additional payments is, in the

305


-----

aggregate, remote and/or incidental, and that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. The
Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that
it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as
contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate different
than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. The balance of this discussion
assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt
instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of stated interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder
as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar
value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received)
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder
will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may
recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise
is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an
accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating
such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that
spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An
accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the
spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of
an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has
made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the
date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S.
holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued
interest income on the date such interest is received.

The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value
of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received) in
respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such
accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at
such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for
foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income
or expense.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered
“passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal
income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to
such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). The calculation of
foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular
circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

306


-----

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition
(less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income as
discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder. The
cost of a Note purchased with euro generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price
translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established
securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has
made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of
such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

If a U.S. holder receives euro on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note,
the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such euro translated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will
determine the U.S. dollar value of such euro by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the
settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the
purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.
An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement
date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note
generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or
expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder
disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at
the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest which
will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency
exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note in excess of euro exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or
loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals)
derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign
currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on the Notes and to the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder
unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer
identification number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply
with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

307


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses
in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in
respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return
disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

U.S. holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in
excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information
report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does not file a required
IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the
assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close
before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes generally will
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in
an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual
for purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements
to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”) and subject to
the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax
on certain “foreign passthru payments” made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as
attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the
date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal
Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the
Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a
significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that
are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years
after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.
Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S.
governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules
described herein. Holders should consult their tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in
the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes,
there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement among the Issuer, Holdco and the Initial
Purchasers dated as of the date of the final Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer has
agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have severally agreed to purchase from the
Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers are BofA Securities Europe SA, Credit
Suisse Bank (Europe), S.A., Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and UniCredit Bank AG. Sales in the United States may be
made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will
purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased. If an
Initial Purchaser defaults, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting
Initial Purchasers may be increased or the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover
page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their
affiliates. Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer and it will not effect any offers or sales of
any Notes in the United States unless such sale is through one or more U.S. registered broker dealers.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer will not, for a period of 60 days
after the Closing Date, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except the Notes and the Guarantees
thereof, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially
similar to the Notes without the prior written consent of the representative under the Purchase Agreement. The
Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the issue price indicated on the cover page hereof. After
the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the
Initial Purchasers without notice.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that:

 - The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration
requirements; and

 - During the initial distribution of the Notes, it will offer or sell Notes only to persons they reasonably believe
to be QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

 - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or
sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
does not apply to the Issuer;

 - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom;

 - to the extent it is also a “Manufacturer,” as defined in MiFID II, it has not offered, sold or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the
European Economic Area in compliance with the applicable provisions of MiFID II, the Insurance
Distribution Directive or the Prospectus Regulation relating to the offer and sale of securities to retail
investors; and

309


-----

 - to the extent it is also a “Manufacturer,” as defined in UK MiFIR, it has not offered, sold or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the UK in
compliance with the applicable provisions of UK MiFIR, FSMA or the UK Prospectus Regulation relating
to the offer and sale of securities to retail investors.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or
otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any securities to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently
no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPS Regulation.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Notes are not intended to
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the UK Prospectus
Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared
and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes (i) in any Member State of the
EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of Notes and (ii) in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus
Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such securities. This Offering Memorandum
is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where
such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of
this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date as
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the twelfth business day following the
date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being herein referred to as “T+12”). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the
U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless
the parties to any such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on
the date of pricing or the next nine succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes
initially will settle in T+12, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock_
Exchange and to have the Notes admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. However, the Issuer
cannot assure you that such listing will be accepted or maintained.

310


-----

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated
to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole
discretion. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S.
Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that a liquid trading market
will develop for the Notes or that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you
receive when you sell will be favorable. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market
price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount
from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our
operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading_
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp duty, taxes
and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions
involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price
of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering
transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or cause the
price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. Neither we nor
any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its
behalf, will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued
without notice. If the Stabilizing Manager engages in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, it may
discontinue them at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes
and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, provide currently
and may provide in the future, commercial lending and banking, investment banking, hedging, consulting and
financial advisory services to the Issuer, the Target and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have
received, and in the future may receive, customary fees, commissions and expenses. The Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates will also act as mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. In addition, each of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates have committed to provide bridge loan financing in respect of the
Transactions in the event the Offering is not consummated, and such entities will receive customary fees in
respect thereof. In addition, a portion of the proceeds from the Offering will be used to repay the Existing
Itelyum Debt. Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (or its affiliates) was a lender under the facilities agreements constituting
the Existing Itelyum Debt and received customary fees, commissions and expenses in connection therewith.

Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the
Notes for their own account.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer’s
affiliates (including the Notes). Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship
with the Issuer may hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, such Initial Purchaser and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in
securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices
of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer and no one else in connection with the Offering
contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. They will not regard any other person (whether or not a recipient of
this Offering Memorandum) as their client in relation to the offering of Notes contemplated by this Offering
Memorandum and will not be responsible to anyone for providing the protections afforded to a client nor giving
advice in relation to the Offering or any transaction or arrangement referred to herein.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

The validity of the Notes and certain other legal matters are being passed upon for us by Weil, Gotshal & Manges
(London) LLP with respect to matters of U.S. federal, New York State, and English and Italian law, and by
Gattai Minoli & Partners with respect to matters of Italian law. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the
Initial Purchasers by Latham & Watkins (London) LLP with respect to matters of U.S. federal, New York State,
English and Italian law and by Maisto e Associati with respect to matters of Italian tax law.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The consolidated financial statements of SSCP Green Holdings S.C.A., for each of the years ended December 31,
2020, 2019 and 2018, which were prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP, included in this Offering
Memorandum, have been audited by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A., independent auditors, as set forth in its report
included in this Offering Memorandum.

Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. is registered under No. 132587 in the Register of Accountancy Auditors (Registro dei
_Revisori Legali maintained by the Italian Ministry of the Economy and Finances in compliance with the_
provisions of Italian Legislative Decree No. 39 of January 27, 2010. Its registered office is at Via Tortona, 25,
20144 Milan, Italy.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is a joint stock company (società per azioni), and each of the Guarantors is a limited liability company
(società a responsabilità limitata), incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy. The Indenture, the Notes
and the Guarantees are or will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement are or will be governed by the laws of England and Wales.

**Service of Process**

None of the directors or executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are residents or citizens of the United
States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and their directors and executive
officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or
the Guarantors or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil
liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore,
although the Issuer and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will
submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes
and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
on such persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service
of process within other jurisdictions (including Italy) upon those persons or the Issuer or the Guarantors provided
that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or the Guarantors, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court
judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the Guarantors or the
Collateral are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to
enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Enforcement of Judgements in Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments obtained
in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not
require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of
May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato) the following conditions are met:

 - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of
jurisdiction;

 - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S.
law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been violated;

 - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of the defendant
party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law;

 - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

 - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

 - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter which
commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

 - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered by a U.S.
court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is necessary, then a
proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The
competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfillment of
all the conditions set out above. In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities
or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought
before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain
substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory, and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions
or grant some of the remedies sought (punitive damages) if their application violates any Italian public policies
and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and of the_
_security interests and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in Italy the jurisdictions where each of_
_the Issuer and Guarantors are organized, and Luxembourg, the jurisdiction whose law will govern the security_
_interests in respect of the share capital of the Target prior to the relocation of the Target’s legal seat and tax_
_residence from Luxembourg to Italy. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a_
_similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future_
_guarantor or a future security provider of the Notes and it does not purport to be complete or to discuss all the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes or the Guarantees or_
_security interests being provided for the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions_
_could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to_
_enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes and the security interests in the Collateral._
_Prospective investors should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

The Issuer is and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Member States of the European Union (the
“EU”).

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to
insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions).

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the
company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its
“centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have
differing and conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined
for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time
of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is
presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That
presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the
three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption
of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s
central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and
where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by
third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management
of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into
consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are
held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the centre of the
company’s operations.

If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU
member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main
insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency
proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the
Insolvency Regulation.

If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2)
of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction
(subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company
only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the
Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any
insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect,
secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An
“establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in

315


-----

the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic
activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU
member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which
the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can
only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency
proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated
under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a
creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request
the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori
concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency
proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main
proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant
EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder
appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the
powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove
assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary
further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets.

The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the
commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to
facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation
with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of
companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency
Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the
insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the
coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the
security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**Italy**

**_Limitation on granting of security interests and on enforcement under Italian law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of a
guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its
by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization
and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the
context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also
be triggered.

**_Corporate benefit_**

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive
a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such
company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and
determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors
and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of

316


-----

the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for
downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial
obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and
effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an
entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for
the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may
derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an
up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may
include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other
members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely
untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such
transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed
by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or
indirect economic benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a
security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a
conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the
subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor
if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within
the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate
benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising
control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control.
Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be
declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and
such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees
or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the
meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”),
whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with
the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null
and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph
3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for
the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial
activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of
the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the
above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group
of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

**_Financial assistance_**

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which
would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of
the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give
financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or
subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls
the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or
subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation
of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions
is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the
company.

**_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_**

Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor is issued to
guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum

317


-----

amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by
reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees granted
by an Italian guarantor must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount
must be indicated in the guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor.
It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is the risk that the
guarantee could be declared void.

**_Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial assistance, the
maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (each, an “Italian Guarantor”) may
be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject
to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee.

In particular, as regards to any Italian Guarantor, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial
assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed at any time an
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans advanced from time to time to
the relevant Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the
Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, and
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee and/or of security granted by such
Italian Guarantor, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee
under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the
enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided further that no Italian
Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian
Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso orsurrogazione)
arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by any Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed 120% of the outstanding principal amount
of the Notes;

(iii) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor
will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of the Notes equal
to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that
time; and

(iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations
of any of the Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest
qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded
in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the
Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively.

In the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-off Date, as regards to Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, given the above limitation in relation to Italian financial assistance law
and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Guarantee and security interests to be granted by Itelyum Regeneration will only guarantee and secure
the 1ssuer’s obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes and shall not
exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including
the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan) advanced from time to time to Itelyum Regeneration (or any of its
direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether

318


-----

directly or indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement
of the relevant Guarantee and/or of security granted by Itelyum Regeneration, in each case net of any
proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/
or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by
Itelyum Regeneration; provided that Itelyum Regeneration shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of
any amounts in excess of the amount that Itelyum Regeneration is entitled to set-off against its claims of
recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by Itelyum
Regeneration under its Guarantee;

(ii) the Guarantee and security interests to be granted by Itelyum Purification will only guarantee and secure the
1ssuer’s obligations under Tranche C (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes and shall not exceed at
any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans (including the
Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan) advanced from time to time to Itelyum Purification (or any of its direct
or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or
indirectly) on or following the Completion Date, and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the
relevant Guarantee and/or of security granted by Itelyum Purification, in each case net of any proceeds
already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by Itelyum
Purification; provided that Itelyum Purification shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts
in excess of the amount that Itelyum Purification is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or
subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by Itelyum Purification
under its Guarantee;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Itelyum Regeneration, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche B
(as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, in each case and from time to time, by an
amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied
by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche B (as defined in “Use
_of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes;_

(iv) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Itelyum Purification, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche C
(as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, in each case and from time to time, by an
amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied
by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche C (as defined in “Use
_of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes;_

(v) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by Itelyum Regeneration
and Itelyum Purification, respectively, will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of
a principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by
Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, respectively, at that time;

(vi) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory
provisions of Italian law in relation to (a) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and
article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (b) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian
Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations
of each of Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not
extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on
overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil
Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and

(vii) any guarantee, indemnity, obligation and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee
and/or security interest by:

(A) Itelyum Regeneration does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment
obligations under Tranche B under the Notes; and

(B) Itelyum Purification does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or payment
obligations under Tranche C under the Notes.

319


-----

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the
relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of, respectively,
Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian
financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in
Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate
the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to
support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, Itelyum Regeneration
and Itelyum Purification. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests granted by, respectively, Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions
regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such
Guarantee and/or security interests could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if
and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance,
including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to each of Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification will be deemed to have no
liability thereunder and the respective Guarantee shall not be in force and effect.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than Itelyum
Regeneration and Itelyum Purification) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental
indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian
Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among
others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to
pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant
security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably
concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security
provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or
the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari
_passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice_
versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and
the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/
or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents
related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the
transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of
any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate
basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the
guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover
limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security.

**_Trust_**

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative
(rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code.
Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and
guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a
representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and
on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to
the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the
rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis,
paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither
directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries.

320


-----

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the
appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that
therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured
by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and
enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and
the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such,
untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian
Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that,
where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement
are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante
_comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_
appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of
such appointment may not be upheld by a court.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be
created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties
to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates
and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept
of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and
powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

**_Certain considerations in relation to guarantees and security interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect
creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in
case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises
management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management
and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy
as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior
only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the
borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the
borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior
to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to
shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be
interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions
summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to
companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans
that are a società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may
apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the
relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian
subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should
any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have
a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes
is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created
over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian
subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

321


-----

However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the provisions summarized
above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the
company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity
subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a
company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) during the period
between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable
subordination” rule.

**_Certain limitations on enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially in a
liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary goals of
the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction
of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security
interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the
appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback
of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions
made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed
explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see
“—Certain Italian insolvency law considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the
security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.
To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there
are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have
a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may
be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

 - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

 - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

 - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party
can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own
obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil
Code;

 - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law
concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or
become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

 - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible
assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

 - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its
opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on
reasonable grounds;

 - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited
by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the
fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles
and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian
law;

322


-----

 - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to
all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment
might not be held to do so;

 - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto);

 - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be
subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the
provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

 - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not
binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other
provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the
parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or
instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

 - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code
are satisfied;

 - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations
of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined
by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

 - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under
the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue
individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic
stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee
is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

 - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the
date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/
attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to
interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the
forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

 - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the
relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa);
the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an
indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is
witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document;

 - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance
waivers or forfeitures;

 - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian
law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory
provisions;

 - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

 - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation;

 - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing
enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and

 - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge
could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a
consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would
be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/
shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be
brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a

323


-----

declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act
that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to
make the two following findings:

 - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or,
if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for
the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

 - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act
was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent
design.

**_Certain Italian insolvency law considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with
which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court
procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be
more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities
nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved.

Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are
expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative
Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19,
2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency
matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate,
_inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency_
**Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38-Suppl.**
Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term
“bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)
with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of
the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial
insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) the adoption of definition of debtor’s
“center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to
the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern
proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized
courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code
aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been originally
postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020 (“Liquidity
**Decree”), converted into law on June 5, 2020 no. 40 and has now been postponed to May 16, 2022 (except for**
the section pertaining to preventive alert and mediation phase, which will entry into force on December 31,
2023), pursuant to Article 1 of the Law Decree No. 118 dated August 24, 2021 (the “Law Decree 118/2021”).
For now, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16,
1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”). Therefore, the practical consequences of the implementation and
potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings of the Insolvency Code and/or of Law Decree 118/2021
cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the
provisions set forth therein.

In addition to the postponement of the entry into force of the Insolvency Code, the main innovations of the Law
Decree 118/2021 are the following: (i) introduction (effective as of November 15, 2021) of a new negotiated
composition procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi) and of a simplified court-supervised pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio); and (ii) amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law (effective as of August 25, 2021), including: (a)_
the possibility to extend the effects of debt restructuring agreements pursuant to Article 182-bis to all nonadhering creditors, provided that creditors representing 75% in relevant classes have adhered to it and certain

324


-----

other requirements are met; and (b) a new Article 182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been introduced
which regulates a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) that can be entered into between a debtor and
creditors representing 75% of the same class and which, at certain conditions, can also bind non-adhering
creditors.

Law Decree 118/2021 needs to be converted in law within 60 days from its publication in the Gazzetta Ufficiale,
otherwise it will cease to be effective; in the context of the conversion process changes and amendments—which
cannot be foreseen—may be included and impact the above new provisions.

Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may
be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts.
In this respect, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian
bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree
containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree
83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6,
2015, effective August 21, 2015 and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law
Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law
No. 232 of December 11, 2016.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill
of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis”
procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by
the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses
being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue
procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses
and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency
(insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more
creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to
regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of
insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial
distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard
the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent
insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a
state of crisis and for insolvent companies.

_Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor
and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are
vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases
where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court
arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian_
_Bankruptcy Law_

Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento attestati)
prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial
condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring
plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval
to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet
the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of
misrepresentation or false certification.

325


-----

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,
therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt
restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all
outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement
proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any
protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or
acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to
certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of
certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed
(although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain
tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court
pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi_
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_

The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount
of claims or debts outstanding, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by
the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare
and that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied
within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court (omologazione),
in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the
relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at
the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is
insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to
insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication.
Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any
conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and
cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law
does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The
plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third
party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs
and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for
the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e.,
prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium
request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The
court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing
within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the
moratorium to the creditors. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition
to the agreement. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for
anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may
be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and
sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the
expert must be deposited.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an
application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the
moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication
of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate
the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

326

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the
outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are
entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at
least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement
binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to
certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other
available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations
and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the
remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed
down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of
the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria)
entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial
indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been informed
of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith and (ii) an
independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law certifies that the non-participating financial creditors have legal status and economic interests similar to
those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The purpose
is to prevent banks with modest credits from block restructuring operations involving more exposed bank
creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors
who did not participate in the agreement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within 30 days of receipt of the
application.

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (as amended by the
Law Decree 118/2021) shall impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of
the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-adhering creditors.

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors
(e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a
scheme.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the
approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy
priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders,
but only up to 80 percent of such financing). Financing granted in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition
for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be
granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority
is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the
agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. The same provisions apply to financings granted by
shareholders up to 80% of their amount.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6,
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
(in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors procedure described below) may
authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such
indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by
the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione),
declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay
pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided
that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure
the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended
by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional
documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

327


-----

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called
_prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_
company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing;
(ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail
an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.

_Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal
to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its
business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such
composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds:
(i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three
preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of
the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor
company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a
restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the
truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato
_preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_
date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the
creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed.
During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title
arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the
court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato
_preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment
of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least
20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going
concern (concordato con continuity aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or
affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and
debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition
for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013
(“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements
from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their
respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant
documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the
preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable
grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9
of the Liquidity Decree, provides that the debtor company which has been granted such extension by the Court,
can, before the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days, even if it has been filed an appeal for a
declaration of bankruptcy. The petition provides for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension
with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Court,
acquired the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the

328


-----

application is based on reasonable grounds. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for
the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the
court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to
overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims,
declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which,
upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting
and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for
the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato
_preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bilancio)._

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years
without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant
requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried
out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the
restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and-if appointed-the judicial commissioner,
reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the
court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness
authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application
pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs
related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law
132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action
provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority
of the claims-which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for
the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)-is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the
term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding
opened with the filing of the preliminary petition.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the
debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuity aziendale). In these
cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as
a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of
the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition
proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide
for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition
agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge
(who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry

329


-----

out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may
be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the
debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of
(a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan
provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is
approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015
abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and
those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are
deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise
their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the
minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be
deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the
_concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to_
meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in
the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of
holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has
however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest - as could be the case
of disenfranchised noteholders - to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit
in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and
to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full
satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert),
in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also
approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if:
(i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors
would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of
the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a
creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato
_preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of_
the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the
aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy
agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular,
that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti
_chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio),_
or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based
on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuity aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a
prebankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy
agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their
interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least
20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going
concern (concordato con continuity aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant
special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by
taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by
Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the
debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may
request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of
the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by
the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

330


-----

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public
prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.

Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be
authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti),
except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment
agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti
_preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di_
_locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_
application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after
admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a
period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to
receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such
indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the deadlines for the
fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione
omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six months. In the procedures for the validation
(omologazione) of concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for_
the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato in
accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court
assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a
_concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities_
were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_

A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial
liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor
when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no
longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by
the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises
(imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_
had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

 - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within
a defined period;

 - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their
claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the
secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale
price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be
considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors
may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore
_fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the_
relevant timing in his or her decision;

 - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver
(curatore fallimentare);

 - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the
company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors;

 - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain
cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made
through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and

331


-----

 - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration
are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of
the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by
Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge
(giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of the creditors,
and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from
the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a
considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect,
Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements
applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is
shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including
employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under
mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as
those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian
bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are
satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below
indicated.

 - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate**
prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be
filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy,
whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such
declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account
(stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless
and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive
full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent
expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The
petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among
the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition
may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be
approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if
classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court
confirmation is also required.

 - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be**
different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions.
Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated
according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the
insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are
privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims.
Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of
preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of
rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and
claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to
secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively,
provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured
creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are
distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these
priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on
equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when
distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a
single asset. In particular, article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation
shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims
originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims
which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’
claims.

332


-----

 - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or**
avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the
granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance
provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made
with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be
particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six
months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the
context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to
three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or
transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request
of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

 - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain**
limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if
entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset
subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes
part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of
bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any
interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and
(ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the
insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-a-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt
entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

 - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/ court commissioner.**

(a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed
back (revocati) vis-a-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

(i) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of
the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the
consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration;

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which not yet due at the time the new security was
granted; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new
security was granted.

(b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period
specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the
non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

(i) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into
or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and

(ii) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency
declaration.

(c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the
bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian
Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is
intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of

333


-----

kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the
purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually
exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out
therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan
(piano attestato) under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato
**_preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione_**
**_del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_**

(vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work
carried out by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity
be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for
by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions
whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective
with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction
was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently
entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a
transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and,
if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person
participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified”
clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the
aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start
enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/
nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without
consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo
_patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by_
the creditor against the third party purchaser.

Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese
_in stato di insolvenza)._

The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must
be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in
the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of
its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during
its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the
public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and
creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to
those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary
administration procedures involve two main phases-a judicial phase and an administrative phase.

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is
insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario
_giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization._
The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian
Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the
company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy.

334


-----

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and
interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the
extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide
either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the
“Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years
(unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors
(concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary
commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan;
however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt.

_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_
_insolvenza)_

Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law
No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is
complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative
phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those
from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry
assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a
Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be
completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery
Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public
interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial
institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these
companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special
insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant
administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered
not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant
legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or
serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario
_liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee_
(comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other
insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of
the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and
includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with
respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up.

_Interim financing_

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain
authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines
(linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy
Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilita) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_

335


-----

expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the
relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such
finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of
the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the
principal creditors.

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilita) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato
_preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_
expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is
provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.

_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_

In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year
(six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that
certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period
of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency
proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any
future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or
by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian
Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the
debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to
(i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency
at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the
value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in
kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into
after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of
the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior
to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent
creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into,
and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously
to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the
insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The
transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the
granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are
challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the
relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the
insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions,
all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis -a-vis creditors if
entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or
thereafter are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to
insolvency.

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union.

**ANNEX A: SUMMARY OF CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ITALIAN GAAP AND IFRS**

This Offering Memorandum contains historical financial information derived from the Consolidated Financial
Statements, prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP.

The information below summarizes certain differences between Italian GAAP and IFRS that may be material to
the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum. We have not prepared a qualitative or
quantitative reconciliation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnote disclosure between
Italian GAAP and IFRS; accordingly, we cannot assure you that this summary is complete. In making an
investment decision, you must rely upon your examination of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries and the
financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own
professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between Italian GAAP and IFRS and how those
differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum.

The differences highlighted below reflect only those differences in accounting policies in force at the time of the
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. All the differences indicated below are applicable to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. No attempt has been made to identify future differences between Italian
GAAP and IFRS, as the result of prescribed changes in accounting standards, transactions or events that may
occur in the future. Regulatory bodies that promulgate Italian GAAP and IFRS have significant ongoing projects
that could affect future comparisons, such as this one between Italian GAAP and IFRS. Future developments or
changes in Italian GAAP and IFRS may give rise to additional differences between Italian GAAP and IFRS,
which could have a significant impact on the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries.

**1.** **INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

_a)_ _Acquisition related costs_

**Italian GAAP**

Accounting for acquisition related costs are not specifically addressed by Italian GAAP. According to the
common accounting practice, acquisition related costs can be considered part of the consideration transferred or
capitalized under intangible assets.

**IFRS**

Acquisition related costs such as finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting and other professional fees are not part
of the consideration transferred and they are accounted for as an expense when the acquirer consumes the related
services.

_b)_ _Transaction costs related to capital increase_

**Italian GAAP**

According to Italian GAAP, costs directly attributable to the equity transaction may be directly recorded in the
income statement or capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the expected period of utilization, which
cannot however exceed five years starting from the year in which the costs were incurred.

**IFRS**

Costs directly attributable to the equity transaction, such as fees paid to lawyers, accountants, and investment
bankers for a capital increase, are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax benefit.

_c)_ _Goodwill_

**Italian GAAP**

Goodwill must be amortized over its estimated useful life or, if the estimated useful life cannot be estimated, over
a maximum of ten years. For the existing goodwill recognized prior to July 1, 2016, the previous accounting
criteria described in the previous paragraph can be maintained until the end of the amortization period.

**IFRS**

Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling
interest recognized and the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill should not be amortized but should be reviewed for impairment at least annually at the cashgenerating-unit level.

A-1


-----

_d)_ _Amortization_

**Italian GAAP**

The amortization method used for intangible assets shall be disclosed for each class of intangible assets together
with the useful life. Furthermore, under Italian GAAP, the amortization period of certain assets category (such as
start-up costs, development costs) cannot exceed five years.

**IFRS**

The amortization method used for intangible assets with finite useful lives, shall be disclosed for each class of
intangible assets.

**2.** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

**Italian GAAP**

Under OIC tangible assets are measured with a cost model meaning costs less any accumulated depreciation and
any accumulated impairment. Under OICs and according to the Civil Code, revaluations permitted only if
authorized by specific laws. In such cases the revaluation does not represent a gain to be accounted on Profit or
Loss but it will be credited into a specific reserve (“III - Riserve di Rivalutazione”) within equity.

**IFRS**

IFRS provides two measurement models:

i) the cost model, in which an asset is recognised at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses, and

ii) the revaluation model, in which items of property, plant and equipment are measured at fair value. If an
entity opts for the revaluation model, it shall apply that model to the entire class of property, plant and
equipment.

Whichever accounting policy is selected, it is required to be applied to entire classes of property, plant and
equipment. Please note that according to IFRS the revaluation of assets is never permitted if the cost model is
adopted by the company, even if authorized by specific laws.

**3.** **INVESTMENT IN NON-CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES**

**Italian GAAP**

According to Italian GAAP, all investments in subsidiaries are consolidated except when not significant, when
financial data are not available on timely manner and without significant costs or when the investment is to be
sold in the upcoming 12 months.

**IFRS**

In accordance with IFRS, all investments in subsidiaries are consolidated.

**4.** **INVENTORY**

**Italian GAAP**

According to Italian GAAP, inventory can be evaluated with the following methods: FIFO (first it first out),
LIFO (last in first out) and average costs.

**IFRS**

IAS 2 does not allow the LIFO method in the inventory valuation. Only FIFO or Weighted Average Cost can be
applied.

**5.** **PROVISIONS FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE INDEMNITIES (TFR)**

**Italian GAAP**

Provisions for employee severance indemnities (TFR) includes the indemnity to be paid on termination of the
employees, calculated in conformity with regulations and the collective contracts in place. TFR is not discounted
and it is calculated as if all the employees left the Target Group at the balance sheet date.

A-2


-----

**IFRS**

According to IAS 19, Provisions for employee severance indemnities (TFR) must take into consideration the
estimated provision to be paid to the employees when they effectively will leave the company. This provision
needs to be discounted appropriately, based on the personnel rotation, the expected interest rate and the life
expectation.

Following the implication of the Italian law No. 296 of December 27, 2006, TFR can be split into two different
parts: i) TFR from 1 January 2007 onward is considered a Defined Contribution Plan and no actuarial calculation
is necessary; and ii) TFR accrued since 31 December 2006 is a Defined Benefit Plan and an actuarial calculation
is required.

**6.** **DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS**

**Italian GAAP**

According to Italian GAAP, loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Debt
issuance costs are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and consequently amortised as interest
expenses through income statement over the term of the loan. For the existing debt issuance costs recognized
prior to July 1, 2016, the previous accounting criteria that included the capitalization of costs can be maintained
until the end of the amortization period.

**IFRS**

According to IFRS, loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Debt issuance
costs are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and consequently amortised as interest expenses
through income statement over the term of the loan. Obtaining a waiver from lenders with respect to a change of
control would be considered a cost related to a debt modification. Under IFRS 9, the company must perform the
10% test to determine if it is an extinguishment. This fee may be included or excluded from the calculation based
on the company’s accounting policy. Per IFRS 9, “if the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an
extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the
remaining term of the modified liability.”

**7.** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

**Italian GAAP**

According to Italian GAAP, business combination accounting criteria requires separate recognition of the
acquirer’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition. These
assets and liabilities must be recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. However, in accordance with
Italian GAAP, there is no specific guidance related to the definition of a business combination. Classification of a
business combination is largely dependent on the legal form of the vehicle which has been acquired.

In addition, accounting for business combinations under common control is not specifically addressed by Italian
GAAP. According to the common accounting practice, assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value
in the financial statements. Goodwill arises as the difference between the price and the fair value of the net assets
acquired.

**IFRS**

IFRS 3 Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”) outlines the accounting when an acquirer obtains control of a
business, such as an acquisition or merger. Such business combinations are accounted for using the ‘acquisition
method’, which generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values at
the acquisition date. A business combination is a transaction or event in which an acquirer obtains control of one
or more businesses. A business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being
conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return directly to investors or other owners, members or
participants (IFRS 3 Appendix A).

IFRS 3 is not applicable to business combination under common control, where the business is ultimately
controlled by the same parties both before and after the business combination. There is currently no guidance in
IFRS on the accounting treatment for combinations among entities under common control. In this case,
management shall develop a policy that is relevant to the decision- making needs of users and that is reliable. For
these cases, according to common principles normally used, no assets and liabilities are restated to their fair
values but they are incorporated at the predecessor carrying values and no new goodwill arises.

A-3

**8.** **REVENUE RECOGNITION**

_a)_ _Recognition criteria_

**Italian GAAP**

Accounting treatment is mainly based on the legal form of the transaction. In particular, revenue recognition
focuses on the concept of realization, transfer of legal right and of risk of asset ownership and on performance of
services and, under a broader approach, the revenues recognition must fall under the general assumptions for the
preparation of the Financial Statements (i.e. accrual and costs/revenues correlation principles)

**IFRS**

The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. This core principle is delivered in a five-step model framework:

    - Identify the contract(s) with a customer;

    - Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

    - Determine the transaction price;

    - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;

    - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

**9.** **LEASE**

**Italian GAAP**

Rental costs, in the Separate Financial Statements, are accounted for on accrual basis. Whereas Rental costs in
the Consolidated Financial Statement level are accounted for in accordance with the former provisions of IAS 17,
thus including the accounting under the financial method for Financial Lease.

**IFRS**

IFRS 16 specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard
provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless

(i) the lease term is 12 months or less or

(ii) the underlying asset has a low value.

Upon lease commencement a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs
incurred by the lessee.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the lease term,
discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, the lessee shall use their incremental borrowing rate (i.e. the rate of interest that a lessee would have
to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a
similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment).

**10. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS**

**Italian GAAP**

Deferred tax assets are classified without provide disclosure of current and non-current.

**IFRS**

Deferred tax assets are classified within non-current assets.

A-4


-----

**11. PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS**

IFRS requires for certain elements of the financial statements to provide wider and more detailed presentations
and disclosures than Italian GAAP. Major differences relate to:

    - a comprehensive income statement is not required under Italian GAAP;

    - a statement of comprehensive income basic and diluted earnings per share for profit or loss from
continuing operations attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and for profit or
loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity for each class of ordinary shares is
not required under Italian GAAP;

    - the disclosure requirements of IFRS 9/IFRS 7 in relation to Financial Instruments (including
receivables, payables and loans). For example, IFRS requires the inclusion of information about ageing
of receivables, while Italian GAAP does not;

    - segment information which is not required under Italian GAAP.

**EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE HALF-YEARLY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021**

Note 1. General information about the Group

SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA (the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on December 14, 2015, and is
organised under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société en commandite par actions for an unlimited period, with
registered office at 8, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Senningerberg, Luxembourg, whose controlling shareholder is
the company STIRLING SQUARE CAPITAL PARTNERS.

SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) operate in the regeneration of waste oil, the
purification of waste solvents, and the responsible management of a wide range of industrial waste. Through
advanced technologies and continuous investments, the Group helps safeguard natural resources and improve
quality of life, with sustainable processes, products and solutions for waste management and the optimization of
served markets. It has more than 50 years of industrial history founded on the principles of the circular economy
starting before it was considered the economy of the future, involving customers, suppliers, institutions, local and
global communities in creating economic, environmental and social value.

Note 2. Basis of presentation

The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in
Shareholders’ Equity, the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the Explanatory Notes which were
approved by the Board of Directors of SSCP Green Holdings SCA on September 3, 2021. These Half-yearly
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting standard
issued by the Italian Accounting Organization (Organismo Italiano di Contabilità, O.I.C.) and in particular OIC
30 pursuant to the provision of the Italian Civil Code. In preparing the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements, however, the Directors reclassified and renamed certain line items in order to render them
more easily comparable to the financial information of entities that apply IFRS. These Half-yearly Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP.

The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the same
principles of consolidation and accounting policies described in the last Consolidated Financial Statements (see
the related report for more information). Consistently with the requirements of OIC 30, the Half-yearly
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include selected explanatory notes.

Current income taxes have been calculated based on the estimated taxable profit for the interim period. Current
income tax assets and liabilities have been measured at the amount expected to be paid from the taxation
Authorities, using tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and
the tax rates estimated on an annual basis.

The items reported in the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are stated in accordance
with the general principles of prudence and accruals and in accordance on going concern basis and taking
account of the economic function of the assets and liabilities.

The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are shown in Euro, which is the functional
currency of the Group and its subsidiaries. All amounts shown in this document are expressed in millions of
Euro, unless otherwise specified. Certain numerical figures set out in this Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements, including financial data presented in millions and certain percentages, have been subject to
rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in columns or rows of tables in this Half-yearly
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information.

_Covid-19 pandemic_

In 2020, the national and international scenario was characterized by the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and
the consequent restrictive measures for its containment by the public authorities of the countries concerned.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced and, since then, has spread around the globe, including
in Italy. The resulting disease, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In

response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide
quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures, the Group transitioned
a portion of its workforce to remote working and experienced operational difficulties; the plants in Pieve
Fissiraga and in Ceccano were closed for several weeks between April and June 2020 resulting in a decrease of
volume of waste oil processed of approximately 68% compared to the corresponding period of 2019;
furthermore, the collection, transportation and storage activities of Environment business unit experienced a
slowdown between March and June 2020.

Additionally, even though the nationwide quarantine in Italy was lifted on May 4, 2020, significant restrictions
and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall Italian economy
and, in turn, Group’s operations and Group’s customers’ operations.

These circumstances have created a context of uncertainty that has distorted the pursuit of the strategic objectives
set in place by the Group in recent years, and have created significant impacts on the results of 2020, both in
terms of revenues and margins in particular in the segment of Regeneration during the lockdown imposed by the

The Group has not suffered financial tensions in net working capital management following the spread of
Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the reduction in revenues and margins, Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. during
2020 agreed with financial institutions an amendment to the financial covenants related to its medium-long term
loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the following years.

Note 3. Scope of consolidation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements

The global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions continued in 2021 to varying degrees.
The progress made by many countries in administering vaccines to their populations had a positive effect, while
the emergence of new variants of the virus led to a renewed rise in infections at a national level. Compared with
the prior year period, the global economy recorded positive growth. Performance during the first half of 2021 is
in part dependent on the extent to which the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic were already
materializing and the degree of intensity applied to the measures taken to contain the spread.Scope of
consolidation and presentation of the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 4. Consolidation accounting principles

The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of
the accounting standard OIC 17.

The subsidiaries are included in the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the date in
which the Parent Company acquires control and are no longer consolidated from the date in which the Parent
Company loses control.

The financial statements of companies included in the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
are consolidated on a line-by line basis. The main consolidation criteria, consistently applied year over year
described herein, are as follows:

   - the carrying amount of investments in consolidated subsidiaries is eliminated against the corresponding
net equity; positive differences are allocated, where possible and gross of the related tax effect, to the
subsidiaries’ assets;

   - Any non-attributable residual amount calculated at the date of acquisitions, represents goodwill and is
recognized as intangible assets and amortized over its estimated useful life. Any negative residual, if it
is attributable to the forecast of unfavorable results, is recognized in the “Consolidation provision for
future risks and charges”; in the event that there is no such forecast of future results, it is entered in a
line of consolidated shareholders’ equity, labelled “Consolidation reserve”;

   - all payables, receivables, revenue and costs, including any unrealized profit and losses, with the related
tax effect, deriving from transactions between subsidiaries and the parent company or between
subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation;

   - deferred or prepaid taxes are calculated on the temporary differences between the taxable income and
the economic result of the companies included in the consolidation;

F-10


-----

   - the portion of the Profit/(loss) for the period attributable to non-controlling interest is recognized on the
basis of the corresponding percentage of Shareholders’ equity not owned by the Parent Company;

   - the portion of the Equity attributable to non-controlling interests is recognized on the basis of the
percentage not owned by the Parent Company.

**Use of estimates**

The preparation of the current Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management’s
estimates and assumptions on the values of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements and on the
information relating to the assets and potential liabilities at the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement
date. The estimates and assumptions used are based on past experience and other factors considered relevant.
However, actual results could differ from the estimates.

Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the impacts of any resulting changes are recognized
directly in the income statement in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision impacts only that
period, or also in future periods, if the revision impacts both the current and future periods. The most significant
accounts concerned by these uncertainties are (i) the valuation of goodwill; (ii) the evaluation of the recoverable
value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets after the execution of the
impairment test exercise and (iii) the depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of
Goodwill and Other intangible assets; (iv) the environmental liabilities; (v) the bad debt provision; (vi) the
provision for risks and charges; (vii) the inventory obsolescence provision.

_Valuation of Goodwill_

With reference to the valuation of Goodwill, it involves a complex procedure that requires the application of
various valuation methods, including the identification and measurement of the fair value of the assets acquired
and the liabilities taken on. These methods use the following inputs: historical information, forecasts based on
estimates or on observation of the market e.g. the royalty rate for the use of comparable assets, the discount rate,
the residual useful life of the assets acquired, etc.

_Evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_

With reference to the measurement of the recoverable value of the goodwill, other intangibles assets and
property, plant and equipment, the Directors, conducted three different impairment tests, one for the
Regeneration, one for the Purification and one for Environmental as of December 31, 2020. The aforementioned
impairment tests were still considered applicable as of June 30, 2021 considering both the plan and the forecasts
used - for which no events emerged that could materially modify the validity - and the stress tests carried out.
The forecasts are based on the assumptions characterized in any case by intrinsic uncertainty, both with reference
to macroeconomic and sector conditions as well as specific conditions tied to the Group, also based on the
current status and knowledge of the pandemic crisis available at the time the estimate was made, which is
inherently uncertain, any change of which—currently unpredictable—might result in final results that are
different than what is estimated, which might require at consolidated level an impairment loss.

_Depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets_

With reference to the depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other
intangible assets, the depreciation rates of the Property, plant and equipment and the amortization rates of
Goodwill and Other intangible assets are calculated based on the best estimate of the residual useful life of the
assets linked to production made by the Group’s technicians and Directors.

As detailed in Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, in 2020, the Group
exercised the option provided by art. 110 of Italian Law Decree 104/2020, converted into Law no. 126 of
October 13, 2020, and registered the revaluation of selected Property, plant and equipment. The subsidiaries
which carried out the revaluations in 2020 are: Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l., S.E.P.I. Ambiente S.r.l., De Luca
Servizi Ambiente S.r.l., Intereco S.r.l., Carbo-Nafta Ecologia S.r.l., Rimondi Paolo S.r.l., Neda Ambiente FVG
S.r.l., Idroclean S.r.l., Agrid S.r.l., Labiolab S.r.l., Itelyum Purification S.r.l., Imtras S.r.l., Centro Risorse S.r.l.,
Innovazione Chimica S.r.l., Keoma S.r.l. and Ferolmet S.r.l..

As of December 31, 2020, on the basis of the expert estimate, the Group has entered higher values in Property,
plant and equipment for € 168.5 million. The expert estimate attests that the net book value after revaluation does

-----

not exceed the recoverable amount likely to be attributable in relation to the production capacity and the
possibility of using the abovementioned Property, plant and equipment by the companies and in relation to its
current value.

For the purposes of the revaluation, the Group used the accounting technique of increasing the historical cost
(gross amount) up to the level of fair value of the asset and for the difference by reducing the accumulated
depreciation, taking into account, however, that, in the case where the fair value of the asset was equal to or less
than the gross amount of the asset, the relative accumulated depreciation was decreased, while in the case where
the fair value of the asset was higher the gross amount has been increased.

As a result of the assessment carried out, the Group also choose to an extension of the period of the original
depreciation, resulting from an assessment by the Directors of the residual useful life of the assets, also on the
basis of the aforementioned expert estimate.

_Environmental liabilities_

The Group is subject, in relation to its activities, to numerous laws and regulations on environmental protection
at European, national, regional and local level, including the laws which implement international conventions
and protocols relating to the activities carried out.

The measurement of future liabilities in connection with reclamation and restoration obligations in relation to
sites and/or land on which the Group carries out its business is a complex process based on technical and
financial assumptions made by the Group’s management and supported by independent experts where necessary.
The estimates are reviewed annually to verify that the amounts recorded are the best reflection of the costs the
Group will face. If any significant variations are found, the amounts are adjusted. The key factors for revising
cost estimates are the developments in the Group’s operations, technologies and the environmental regulations.

Measurement of environmental liabilities recorded in the financial statements take into account the
environmental legislation currently in force. However, this measurement could be subject to variations, even to a
significant extent, in relation to: (i) the possibility of further contamination arising; (ii) the results of current and
future refurbishment and the other possible effects arising from the application of the laws in force; (iii) the
possible effects of new laws and regulations for environmental protection; (iv) the effects of any technological
innovations for environmental cleansing; and (v) the possibility of disputes concerning the environmental
liability for specific sites and the difficulty of determining the potential consequences of this, including in
relation to the liability of other parties and any indemnity.

_Provisions for risks and charges and bad debt provision_

Regarding the provisions for risks and charges and the bad debt provision, the Half-yearly Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements reflects the estimate of liabilities and the collectability of the assets based on
the best knowledge of solvency of the counterparts and the state of litigation, using the information provided by
the legal and tax advisors, who assist the Group as well as considering outstanding contracts with the
counterparts. The estimate of the risks is subject to uncertainties and it cannot be excluded that in future fiscal
years, costs which cannot currently be estimated, might arise due to a worsening of the state of litigation and the
level of counterparts’ solvency.

_Inventory obsolescence provision_

The inventory obsolescence provision reflects the management’s estimate of the Group’s expected losses in
value, determined on the basis of past experience. Abnormal market price trends could have repercussions in
future inventory write-downs.

environmental legislation.

utilization for the purchase of CO2 quotas in the six months, net of the estimate of quotas to be purchased based
on the production of the period.

Note 36. Derivative financial instruments

As previously described, the Group undertook forward operations in derivative financial instruments in order to
hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuations relating to the bank loans.

**_Financial risk management_**

As the Group is operative on global markets, it is exposed to a range of financial risks, including those regarding
interest, currency rate and cash flow movements. In order to minimize these risks, the Group therefore uses
derivative instruments for ‘‘risk management’’, while derivative instruments or similar are not utilized for
trading purposes.

**_Currency risk_**

The Euro is the functional currency used for the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements;
however, the Group carries out operations in currencies other than the Euro, principally in US Dollars, with an
exposure therefore to currency risk.

The risk management policy seeks to reduce the impact on Group margins and cash flows from currency
movements, minimizing at the same time protection costs against these events in terms of the pre-chosen hedging
instruments. For commercial or financial transactions in currencies other than the Euro, the currency risk
managed concerns fluctuations in the exchange rate between the agreement of the commercial/financial operation
and its receipt/payment.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The exposure to interest rate risk relates essentially to loans agreed at variable rates. This risk concerns the
possibility that an increase in market rates results in higher interest charges.

This type of hedge seeks to minimize interest rate changes generated by loans at variable rates. The exposure to
interest rate risk is calculated on the basis of the loan repayment plans and the parameters used to calculate
interest.

Specifically, the Group - in accordance with the requirements of accounting standard OIC 32 - accounted for
hedging transactions according to the hedge accounting criterion for the management of the following financial
risks:

As of June 30, 2021 Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. has in place an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) for a notional total
amount of € 48.6 million (€ 48.5 million as of December 31, 2020) with Banca Intesa San Paolo and Banco BPM
with maturity on December 31, 2021, in order to hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuations relating to the loan.
The IRS derivative contracts are used to convert floating rate loans to fixed rate loans.

As of June 30, 2021 Itelyum Purification S.r.l. has in place an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) for a notional total
amount of € 34.0 million (€ 35.8 million as of December 31, 2020) with Banca Intesa San Paolo and Banco BPM
with maturity on December 31, 2022, in order to hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuations relating to the loan.
The IRS derivative contracts are used to convert floating rate loans to fixed rate loans.

**EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR**
**THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018**

Note 1. General information about the Group

SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA (the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on December 14, 2015, and is
organised under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société en commandite par actions for an unlimited period, with
registered office at 8, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Senningerberg, Luxembourg, whose controlling shareholder is
the company STIRLING SQUARE CAPITAL PARTNERS.

SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) operate in the regeneration of waste oil, the
purification of waste solvents, and the responsible management of a wide range of industrial waste. Through
advanced technologies and continuous investments, the Group helps safeguard natural resources and improve
quality of life, with sustainable processes, products and solutions for waste management and the optimization of
served markets. It has more than 50 years of industrial history founded on the principles of the circular economy
starting before it was considered the economy of the future, involving customers, suppliers, institutions, local and
global communities in creating economic, environmental and social value.

Note 2. Basis of presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement and the Explanatory Notes which were approved by the Board of Directors of SSCP Green Holdings
SCA on September 3, 2021. These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the
accounting standards issued by the Italian Accounting Organization (Organismo Italiano di Contabilità, O.I.C.)
pursuant to the provision of the Italian Civil Code. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, however,
the Directors reclassified and renamed certain line items in order to render them more easily comparable to the
financial information of entities that apply IFRS. These Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in
accordance with Italian GAAP, but do not constitute the Company’s statutory consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.

The items reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements are stated in accordance with the general principles
of prudence and accruals and in accordance on going concern basis and taking account of the economic function
of the assets and liabilities.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are shown in Euro, which is the functional currency of the Group and its
subsidiaries. All amounts shown in this document are expressed in millions of Euro, unless otherwise specified.
Certain numerical figures set out in this Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial data presented in
millions and certain percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data
in columns or rows of tables in this Consolidated Financial Statements may vary slightly from the actual
arithmetic totals of such information.

_Covid-19 pandemic_

In 2020, the national and international scenario was characterized by the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and
the consequent restrictive measures for its containment by the public authorities of the countries concerned.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced and, since then, has spread around the globe, including
in Italy. The resulting disease, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide
quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures, the Group transitioned
a portion of its workforce to remote working and experienced operational difficulties; the plants in Pieve
Fissiraga and in Ceccano were closed for several weeks between April and June 2020 resulting in a decrease of
volume of waste oil processed of approximately 68% compared to the corresponding period of 2019;
furthermore, the collection, transportation and storage activities of Environment business unit experienced a
slowdown between March and June 2020.

Additionally, even though the nationwide quarantine in Italy was lifted on May 4, 2020, significant restrictions
and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall Italian economy
and, in turn, Group’s operations and Group’s customers’ operations.

F-36


-----

These circumstances have created a context of uncertainty that has distorted the pursuit of the strategic objectives
set in place by the Group in recent years, and have created significant impacts on the results of 2020, both in
terms of revenues and margins in particular in the segment of Regeneration during the lockdown imposed by the
Italian government.

The Group has not suffered financial tensions in net working capital management following the spread of
Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the reduction in revenues and margins, Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. during
2020 agreed with financial institutions an amendment to the financial covenants related to its medium-long term
loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the following years.

The global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions continued in 2021 to varying degrees.
The progress made by many countries in administering vaccines to their populations had a positive effect, while
the emergence of new variants of the virus led to a renewed rise in infections at a national level. Compared with
the prior year period, the global economy recorded positive growth. Performance during the first half of 2021 is
in part dependent on the extent to which the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic were already
materializing and the degree of intensity applied to the measures taken to contain the spread.

Note 4. Consolidation accounting principles

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standard
OIC 17.

The subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date in which the Parent
Company acquires control and are no longer consolidated from the date in which the Parent Company loses
control.

The financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are consolidated on a
line-by-line basis. The main consolidation criteria, consistently applied year over year described herein, are as
follows:

   - the carrying amount of investments in consolidated subsidiaries is eliminated against the corresponding
net equity; positive differences are allocated, where possible and gross of the related tax effect, to the
subsidiaries’ assets;

   - Any non-attributable residual amount calculated at the date of acquisitions, represents goodwill and is
recognized as intangible assets and amortized over its estimated useful life. Any negative residual, if it

F-38


-----

is attributable to the forecast of unfavorable results, is recognized in the “Consolidation provision for
future risks and charges”; in the event that there is no such forecast of future results, it is entered in a
line of consolidated shareholders’ equity, labelled “Consolidation reserve”;

   - all payables, receivables, revenue and costs, including any unrealized profit and losses, with the related
tax effect, deriving from transactions between subsidiaries and the parent company or between
subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation;

   - deferred or prepaid taxes are calculated on the temporary differences between the taxable income and
the economic result of the companies included in the consolidation;

   - the portion of the Profit (loss) for the year attributable to non-controlling interest is recognized on the
basis of the corresponding percentage of Shareholders’ equity not owned by the Parent Company;

   - the portion of the Equity attributable to non-controlling interests is recognized on the basis of the
percentage not owned by the Parent Company.

Note 5. Significant accounting policies

The most significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in
accordance with legislative requirements, are the following:

**Revaluation as allowed by Italian Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020**

In 2020, the Group exercised the option provided by art. 110 of Italian Law Decree 104/2020, converted into
Law no. 126 of October 13, 2020, and registered the revaluation of selected Property, plant and equipment. The
subsidiaries which carried out the revaluations in 2020 are: Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l., S.E.P.I. Ambiente S.r.l.,
De Luca Servizi Ambiente S.r.l., Intereco S.r.l., Carbo-Nafta Ecologia S.r.l., Rimondi Paolo S.r.l., Neda
Ambiente FVG S.r.l., Idroclean S.r.l., Agrid S.r.l., Labiolab S.r.l., Itelyum Purification S.r.l., Imtras S.r.l., Centro
Risorse S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l., Keoma S.r.l. and Ferolmet S.r.l..

The value of Property, plant and equipment was determined by comparing the Fair value of the assets, as
indicated in the expert estimate prepared by PRAXI S.p.A., with registered office in C.so Vittorio Emanuele 3 Torino, with the residual net book value, after the depreciation for the year 2020.

In particular, the Fair value of the assets was determined by applying an evaluation process based on its
hypothetical replacement with a new similar asset. This way, its “maximum value” has been determined and it is
identifiable with the cost the Group would incur to replace it or with its exact replica (“new construction cost”)
or, alternatively, if less, with that of an assets with equivalent characteristics and production capacities
(“replacement cost”).

Subsequently, the maximum value of the assets has been reduced to take into account the loss of value from the
“physical depreciation” and from the “functional obsolescence” which measure their loss of value with respect to
a new one.

On the basis of the expert estimate, the Group has entered higher values in Property, plant and equipment for
€ 168.5 million. The expert estimate attests that the net book value after revaluation does not exceed the
recoverable amount likely to be attributable in relation to the production capacity and the possibility of using the
abovementioned Property, plant and equipment by the companies and in relation to its current value.

For the purposes of the revaluation, the Group used the accounting technique of increasing the historical cost
(gross amount) up to the level of fair value of the asset and for the difference by reducing the accumulated
depreciation, taking into account, however, that, in the case where the fair value of the asset was equal to or less
than the gross amount of the asset, the relative accumulated depreciation was decreased, while in the case where
the fair value of the asset was higher the gross amount has been increased.

As a result of the assessment carried out, the Group choose to an extension of the period of the original
depreciation, resulting from an assessment by the Directors of the residual useful life of the assets, also on the
basis of the aforementioned expert estimate.

F-39


-----

All the subsidiaries have also opted to the substitute tax, equal to 3% of the revaluation, to recognize it for tax
purposes. Tax recognition begins, for what concern the deductibility of depreciation, from the year following that
in which the revaluation has been made (2021 fiscal year), while in the case of transfer with consideration the
higher values are recognized from January 1, 2024.

The accounting counterpart of the increase in the value of Property, plant and equipment is an equity reserve,
labelled as “Revaluation reserve – Italian Law Decree 104/2020”, for a total amount net of the aforementioned
substitute tax of € 163.4 million. The “Revaluation reserve –Italian Law Decree 104/2020” is subject to particular
civil constraints better explained below and it is a reserve under “suspension of tax” which, when distributed to
the Shareholders, contributes to the formation of the Group’s taxable amount and the taxable income of the
recipient. Although this reserve is in the nature of a reserve under suspension of tax, by way of derogation from
the general rule and as provided for in document OIC 25 (par. 64), the Group has not entered the deferred tax
liability because, from the historical trend in the distribution of dividends from the subsidiaries to the Parent
Company, the likelihood of future distributions of these reserves to the shareholders was considered to be low.

The substitute tax was therefore entered in Tax and social security payables for € 5.1 million (of which
€ 1.7 million due on 2021 and € 3.4 million in due on 2022 and 2023).

The table below shows the effect of the revaluation mentioned above for each category of the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.

**(in millions of €)** **Revaluation**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **163.4**

It should also be noted that the Group intends to exercise the option provided by paragraphs 7 and 8 of art. 110 of
the Law Decree 104/2020, converted into Law no. 126 of October 13, 2020, which refer to articles 11, 13, 14 and
15 of Law n. 342/2000, Italian legislation, to recognize for tax purposes the higher book values compared to the
fiscally recognized values of Property, plant and equipment and Goodwill and other intangible assets, by paying
a substitute tax equal to 3% of the revaluation,.

These higher values as of December 31, 2020, net of amortization, amount to € 4.4 million.

An equity reserve, net of substitute tax, will be recognized as a result of the tax recognition of these higher
values. This provision must be made under “suspension of tax” on the equity reserves or, in the event these are
insufficient, pursuant to art. 10 co. 4 of Italian Ministerial Decree 162/2001, on a corresponding part of the Share
capital.

**Goodwill and Other intangible assets**

Goodwill includes the amounts paid in this regard in relation to business acquisitions or other corporate
operations and are amortized over their useful life. The useful life is estimated starting from the initial
recognition of goodwill and is not modified in subsequent years. Where it is not possible to estimate the useful
life, goodwill is amortized over a period of 10 years.

Other intangible assets are recorded at purchase or production cost, increased by directly allocated acquisition
costs, adjusted by the relative amortization provision and increased by any monetary revaluations in accordance
with law.

Other intangible assets are recorded with the approval of the Board of Statutory Auditors in the cases established
by law.

Start up and formation expenses are amortized over five years, with straight-line amortization applied.

Development costs are amortized according to their useful life, in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to
reliably estimate their useful life, they are amortized over a period not exceeding five years. Until the

F-40


-----

amortization is completed, dividends can be distributed only if sufficient reserves remain available to cover the
amount of the unamortized costs. The costs incurred for basic research are charged to the income statement in the
year in which they are incurred.

Advertising costs are entirely recognized to profit and loss in the period in which they incur.

Industrial patent and similar intellectual property rights are amortized based on their estimated useful life, which
has been assessed in a 3-5-year basis starting from the fiscal year in which the process of economic utility
initiated.

In the event that, independently of the amortization already recorded, there is a permanent loss of value, the asset
is derecognized; if, in subsequent years, the reasons justifying the write-down cease, the original value is
restored, within the limits of the value that the asset would have had without the impairment loss, except for the
item ‘‘Goodwill’’ and ‘‘Deferred charges’’.

Goodwill and Other intangible assets amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, in accordance with the following amortization schedule:

**Asset** **Estimated useful life**

Goodwill 5/10 years
Start up and formation expenses 5 years
Development costs 5 years
Industrial patents and similar intellectual property rights 5 years
Concessions, licenses, trademark and similar rights 5 years
Other (leasehold improvements, finance costs, other Duration of underlying contract (residual mortgage or
deferred) rental duration)
Intangible assets under construction Such asset are not amortized until the improvements
are completed.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at purchase price, including accessory costs directly attributable to
the asset, the direct and indirect costs for the portion reasonably attributable to the asset and are shown net of the
related accumulated depreciation. The activities carried out by internal staff for engineering development and for
the coordination of the construction of the plant are capitalized at cost.

The gross amount of Property, plant and equipment is revalued when specific Italian laws allow or require the
revaluation of the Property, plant and equipment to align them, even only partially, to their higher normal value
determined on the basis of their residual useful life.

In particular, in the financial statements of some subsidiaries, revaluations were made in accordance with Italian
laws n. 576/1975, n. 72/1983, n. 413/1991, n. 342/2000, n. 448/2001, n. 266/2005, n. 2/2009 and n. 126/2020.
For further information regarding the revaluation made in 2020, please refer to paragraph “Revaluation as
allowed by Italian Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020” above.

The depreciation rates of the Property, plant and equipment are calculated based on the residual utilization value,
on the basis of rates considered adequate to represent the usage and/or consumption of the assets and their
reduced usage over time.

The estimated useful life of the Group assets are as follows:

**Asset** **Estimated useful life (in years)**

Land and buildings 10, 18, 33
Plant and machinery 8, 10, 11
Industrial and commercial equipment 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10
Other assets 4, 5, 7, 8

For Property, plant and equipment acquired during the year, the above-mentioned rates are reduced by half,
considered as representative of the lower utilization of these assets, presuming that their participation in the
production process is on average half of the year.

-----

**Impairment of Property, plant and equipment, Goodwill and Other intangible assets**

When events occur leading to the assumption of impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill or other
intangible assets, their recoverability is tested by comparing the book value with the related recoverable value,
which is the fair value adjusted for disposal costs or the value in use, whichever is greater.

The fair value is the amount that may be received for the sale of an asset or that may be paid for the transfer of a
liability in a regular transaction between market operators as at the valuation date (i.e. exit price). The fair value
of an asset is determined by adopting the valuations that market operators would use to determine the price of the
asset.

The value in use is determined by discounting projected cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and, if they
are significant and can be reasonably determined, from its sale at the end of its useful life, net of any disposal
costs. Cash flows are determined based on reasonable, documentable assumptions representing the best estimate
of future economic conditions which will occur during the remaining useful life of the asset, with a greater
emphasis on outside information. Discounting is done at a rate reflecting current market conditions for the time
value of money and specific risks of the asset not reflected in the estimated cash flows. The valuation is done for
individual assets or for the smallest identifiable group of assets which, through ongoing use, generates incoming
cash flow that is largely independent of those of other assets or groups of assets (“cash-generating units” or
CGUs).

The CGUs identified by the Group are the following: Regeneration, Purification and Environment. If the reasons
for impairment losses no longer apply, the assets (except for goodwill) are revalued, and the adjustment is posted
to the income statement as a revaluation (recovery of value). The recovery of value is applied to the lower of the
recoverable value and the book value before any impairment losses previously carried out, less any depreciation
that would have been recorded if an impairment loss had not been recorded for the asset.

**Financial assets**

Investments in subsidiaries not consolidated and associates are accounted for at cost. Investments in other
companies are accounted for at cost.

Receivables recorded under financial assets are measured using the amortized cost method.

**Inventory**

Inventories of consumables and spare parts are valued on the basis of the FIFO criterion at the lower of the cost
incurred and the net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes the purchase cost, and any ancillary
charges. Ancillary charges, as they are fungible, are calculated as the weighted average cost of the year.

Inventories of raw materials, work in progress and finished products are also valued on the basis of the FIFO
criterion at the lower of the purchase or production cost and the net realizable value. The production cost
includes ancillary charges, costs directly attributable to the product and other costs, for the reasonably
attributable portion, relating to the manufacturing period.

In the Landriano Plant, (i) raw materials of pharmaceutical products and alcohol are valued at the last purchase
cost; work in progress pharmaceutical products and alcohol are valued at specific cost, which consists in the
attribution to the individual physical units of the costs specifically incurred for them; (ii) finished products are
valued at production cost. In the Rho Plant, raw materials are valued at the last purchase cost and finished
products are valued at the weighted average cost of the year.

Inventories are subject to devaluation in the balance sheet when the realizable value inferable from the market
trend is lower than the relative book value. Obsolete and slow-moving stocks are written down in relation to their
possibility of use or realization.

Where it is no longer possible to estimate the goods at incurred cost as determined by the above criteria, due to
lower selling prices, depreciated goods, obsolescence, slow moving or possibility of use, the net realizable value
determined by the market performance is applied Inventories.

F-42


-----

**Trade receivables**

Receivables are recognised according to the amortised cost criteria, taking into account the timing and the
expected value. The amortised cost criteria is not applied where the effects are insignificant or where the
settlement costs, commissions paid between the parties and any other difference between the initial value and the
value on maturity is insignificant or where the receivables are short-term (i.e. with maturity of less than 12
months).

The value of receivables, established as above, is adjusted where necessary by a write-down provision, presented
as a direct reduction of the value of the receivables to their expected realisable value. The write-down to the
consolidated financial statements is equal to the difference between the book value and the value of estimated
future cash flows, less amounts which are not expected to be received. The write-down is recognised in the
Income Statement.

Receivables from factoring, with no draw back options, are eliminated from the Balance Sheet. Receivables from
factors with draw back options, remain recorded in the Balance Sheet and a financial liability is recorded
following the advance received.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are stated at nominal value.

**Accruals and deferrals**

Prepayments and accruals include the costs and revenues accruing in the year but due in subsequent years.

**Provisions for employee severance indemnities**

The Provisions for employee severance indemnities recorded in the financial statements represent the actual debt
of the Group with its employees at the reporting date, net of any advances to employees and payments to the
complementary pension funds indicated by the employees or to the INPS Treasury Fund, pursuant to Article 1,
paragraph 755 and thereafter of Law No. 296/06, Italian legislation.

It shall be noted that as of 1 January 2007, for companies with at least 50 employees, the Italian Finance Law and
related implementing decrees introduced significant changes in the regulation of provisions for employment
termination benefits, including the employee’s choice concerning the allocation of severance indemnities
accruing (to the supplementary pension funds or the “Treasury Fund” managed by INPS - national social welfare
institution). The amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements is therefore net of payments to the
funds mentioned.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recorded based on the principles of prudence and accruals and include provisions made to cover
losses and debts of a certain nature and of a certain and probable existence, with uncertain amount and
occurrence date. The provisions reflect the best estimate on the basis of available information at the reporting
date. Potential liabilities which are only considered possible are described in the notes.

Provisions are recognized in the relevant line item of the income statement. Whenever the nature of the provision
is not feasible with the relevant line item of the income statement, the provisions are entered in the “Provision for
risk and charges” line item of the income statement.

Provisions for environmental liabilities are recorded following changes in terms of regulations or environmental
regulations or litigation for violation of these rules, including rules on safety on construction sites and in the
workplace. The estimate of the amount of the Provision is made considering the costs that it is presumed to incur
in relation to the existing situation, also taking into account any technical developments and future legislation,
which are known at the balance sheet date. The incurring of the costs indicated is presumed reasonably certain
when a new legislative provision is certain and obliges the Group to remedy the damage caused or there have
been administrative measures or legal proceedings, except in cases in which the disputes are deemed unfounded
or the relative negative outcome is deemed unlikely.

F-43


-----

Provision for Emission Trading CO2 are recorded to deliver the emission allowances to the competent national
authority on an accruals basis, in the year in which the obligation arises, in proportion to the emissions of
greenhouse gases produced during the year itself. When preparing the consolidated financial statements, the
Group records a liability to the competent national authority, in counterpart to the recognition in the income
statement of the related costs accrued for the year.

Provisions for future charges relating to future flows on derivatives are discounted if they derive from a certain
and reasonably estimated obligation and the disbursement is expected to take place over a period of time that
makes the present value of the provision significantly different from the its estimated value.

**Loans, trade and other payables**

Loans, trade and other payables are recognised according to the amortised cost criteria, taking account of their
timing ant the net realizable value. The amortised cost criteria is not applied to loans and payables where the
effects are insignificant. Effects are considered insignificant for short-term loans and payables (i.e. with maturity
of less than 12 months), or when the transaction costs, the commissions paid between the parties and any other
difference between the initial value and the value at maturity are not significant. The breakdown by geographical
area is not provided, as it is not significant.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivative financial instruments are financial assets and liabilities, recognized at fair value.

Derivatives are classified as hedging instruments only when, on the initiation of hedging, a strict and documented
correlation exists between the characteristics of the hedged item and those of the hedging instrument, this
hedging connection is formally documented and the effect of the hedge, periodically verified, is high.

Where derivatives hedge a risk of changes in future cash flows of the hedged instrument (cash flow hedge), the
effective portion of profits or losses of the derivative financial instrument are suspended to net equity. The
ineffective portion of the profits and losses associated with a hedge are recognized to the income statement.
When the related transaction is realized, the accumulated gains and losses that have been recorded to equity are
recognized in the income statement (to adjust or supplement the income statement accounts affected by the
hedged cash flows). The Group applies hedge accounting to cover the fluctuation of cash flows due to exchange
rates and interest rates.

Therefore, the changes of the relative fair value of derivative hedging financial instruments are recognized to a
separate net equity reserve (‘‘Reserve for future cash flow hedging operations’’) in the case of the hedging of
cash flows in a manner which offsets the effects of the cash flows hedged (the ineffective component, in addition
to the change in the time value of options and forwards, is classified to the income statement).

**Recognition of revenues and costs**

Revenues and costs are recognized based on the accruals principle, independently of the receipt or payment date,
net of returns (also through the recording of a provision under liabilities), allowances and bonuses. In particular:

    - revenues from the sale of goods are recognized when the substantial and non-formal transfer of the title
of ownership has occurred, assuming the transfer of risks and benefits for the substantial transfer;

    - revenues from the sale of products and goods or from the provision of services relating to core business
are recognized net of returns, allowances and bonuses, as well as taxes directly connected with the
products sold and the services provided;

    - revenues for services provided are recognized upon their completion and/or maturity;

    - transactions with related parties are carried out at normal market conditions;

    - financial income and expenses are recognized on an accrual basis;

    - costs relating to the disposal of receivables for any reason (with or without draw back options) and of
any nature (commercial, financial, other) are charged on an accrual basis.

F-44


-----

**Income taxes**

Income taxes are registered based on the estimate of taxable income in accordance with law provisions and
taking into account the applicable exemptions and the tax credits. The related payables are registered within “Tax
payables” net of any payments made and of any withholding taxes. Any positive balance is registered within
“Tax receivables”.

Deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets are calculated on the temporary differences between the values of
assets and liabilities and the corresponding values recognized for tax purposes. Their valuation is carried out
taking account of the tax rate that the Group expects to incur in the year in which such differences will be used to
calculate taxable income, considering the rates in force or already enacted as of the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, if there is a reasonable certainty of
the existence of taxable income in the years in which the differences will reverse. On the other hand, deferred tax
liabilities are recorded on all taxable temporary differences. Deferred taxes relating to tax-suspension reserves
are not recorded if there is a low likelihood that these reserves will be distributed to Shareholders.

The Group has two different tax consolidation agreements with its subsidiaries, relating to taxes on income in
Italy, pursuant to Article 117 et seq. of Italian Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986 (Testo Unico
delle Imposte sui Redditi):

    - From the year ended December 31, 2013, the company Itelyum Purification S.r.l., acts as the
consolidating company and calculates a single assessable base for the companies of the Group Itelyum
Purification adhering to the tax consolidation and therefore benefits from the possibility of offsetting
assessable income with assessable losses in a single tax declaration.

    - From the year ended December 31, 2016, the company Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l., acts as the
consolidating company and calculates a single assessable base for the companies of the Group Itelyum
Regeneration adhering to the tax consolidation and therefore benefits from the possibility of offsetting
assessable income with assessable losses in a single tax declaration.

The companies involved in the tax consolidation agreements transfer to the consolidating company its assessable
income (assessable income or tax loss); the consolidating company recognises a receivable equal to the IRES to
be paid (the consolidated company recognises a payable to the consolidating company).

**Criteria for converting items in foreign currencies**

Receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies are accounted for at the value in Euro
based on the exchange rate at the time of their formation; the exchange differences, realized on the date of
collection or payment, are recorded in the income statement. As of the balance sheet date, receivables and
payables in foreign currencies are adjusted to the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date; consequently, any
accrued exchange differences are recognized in the income statement under item “Foreign exchange gains /
(losses)”. Any net profit resulting from the change in foreign currency items as of the balance sheet date must be
accounted to a specific non-distributable reserve.

**Use of estimates**

The preparation of the current Consolidated Financial Statements requires management’s estimates and
assumptions on the values of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements and on the information relating
to the assets and potential liabilities at the Consolidated Financial Statement date. The estimates and assumptions
used are based on past experience and other factors considered relevant. However, actual results could differ
from the estimates.

Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the impacts of any resulting changes are recognized
directly in the income statement in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision impacts only that
period, or also in future periods, if the revision impacts both the current and future periods. The most significant
accounts concerned by these uncertainties are (i) the valuation of goodwill; (ii) the evaluation of the recoverable
value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets after the execution of the
impairment test exercise and (iii) the depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of
Goodwill and Other intangible assets; (iv) the environmental liabilities; (v) the bad debt provision; (vi) the
provision for risks and charges; (vii) the inventory obsolescence provision.

_Valuation of Goodwill_

With reference to the valuation of Goodwill, it involves a complex procedure that requires the application of
various valuation methods, including the identification and measurement of the fair value of the assets acquired
and the liabilities taken on. These methods use the following inputs: historical information, forecasts based on
estimates or on observation of the market e.g. the royalty rate for the use of comparable assets, the discount rate,
the residual useful life of the assets acquired, etc. The Directors also utilized the work of independent experts.

_Evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_

With reference to the measurement of the recoverable value of the goodwill, other intangibles assets and
property, plant and equipment, the Directors, conducted three different impairment tests, one for the
Regeneration, one for the Purification and one for Environmental as of December 31, 2020 2019 and 2018.

In order to perform such impairment tests for the Regeneration and the Purification the value in use was
determined on the basis of economic and financial projections of each CGU for a period of 5 years and a terminal
value based on the perpetuity method, considering a growth rate (g-rate) not higher than 2%.

These cash flows were discounted using a discount rate (WACC), taking into account the specific risks of the
business and which reflects the current market valuations of the cost of money. The calculation of the weighted
average cost of capital, led to a value of 9.0% for Regeneration and to a value of 8.4% for Purification.

For Environmental the impairment test was performed on the basis of fair value, determined considering the
amount that may be received for the sale of an asset or that may be paid for the transfer of a liability in a regular
transaction between market operators as at the valuation date (i.e. exit price).

No impairment emerged from the impairment tests, resulting in the value in use obtained significantly higher
than the net invested capital.

The forecasts—including the level of investments and the change in net working capital—are based on the
assumptions characterized in any case by intrinsic uncertainty, both with reference to macroeconomic and sector
conditions as well as specific conditions tied to the Group, also based on the current status and knowledge of the
pandemic crisis available at the time the estimate was made, which is inherently uncertain, any change of
which—currently unpredictable—might result in final results that are different than what is estimated, which
might require at consolidated level an impairment loss.

_Depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets_

With reference to the depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other
intangible assets, the depreciation rates of the Property, plant and equipment and the amortization rates of
Goodwill and Other intangible assets are calculated based on the best estimate of the residual useful life of the
assets linked to production made by the Group’s technicians and Directors.

_Environmental liabilities_

The Group is subject, in relation to its activities, to numerous laws and regulations on environmental protection
at European, national, regional and local level, including the laws which implement international conventions
and protocols relating to the activities carried out.

The measurement of future liabilities in connection with reclamation and restoration obligations in relation to
sites and/or land on which the Group carries out its business is a complex process based on technical and
financial assumptions made by the Group’s management and supported by independent experts where necessary.
The estimates are reviewed at each balance sheet date to verify that the amounts recorded are the best reflection
of the costs the Group will face. If any significant variations are found, the amounts are adjusted. The key factors
for revising cost estimates are the developments in the Group’s operations, technologies and the environmental
regulations.

Measurement of environmental liabilities recorded in the financial statements takes into account the
environmental legislation currently in force. However, this measurement could be subject to variations, even to a
significant extent, in relation to: (i) the possibility of further contamination arising; (ii) the results of current and

future refurbishment and the other possible effects arising from the application of the laws in force; (iii) the
possible effects of new laws and regulations for environmental protection; (iv) the effects of any technological
innovations for environmental cleansing; and (v) the possibility of disputes concerning the environmental
liability for specific sites and the difficulty of determining the potential consequences of this, including in
relation to the liability of other parties and any indemnity.

_Provisions for risks and charges and bad debt provision_

Regarding the provisions for risks and charges and the bad debt provision, the consolidated financial statements
reflects the estimate of liabilities and the collectability of assets based on the best knowledge of solvency of the
counterparts and the state of litigation, using the information provided by the legal and tax advisors, who assist
the Group as well as considering outstanding contracts with the counterparts. The estimate of the risks is subject
to uncertainties and it cannot be excluded that in future fiscal years, costs which cannot currently be estimated,
might arise due to a worsening of the state of litigation and the level of counterparts’ solvency.

_Inventory obsolescence provision_

The inventory obsolescence provision reflects the management’s estimate of the Group’s expected losses in
value, determined on the basis of past experience. Abnormal market price trends could have repercussions in
future inventory write-downs.

Note 38. Derivative financial instruments

As previously described, the Group undertook forward operations in derivative financial instruments in order to
hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuations relating to the bank loans.

**_Financial risk management_**

As the Group is operative on global markets, it is exposed to a range of financial risks, including those regarding
interest, currency rate and cash flow movements. In order to minimize these risks, the Group therefore uses
derivative instruments for ‘‘risk management’’, while derivative instruments or similar are not utilized for
trading purposes.

**_Currency risk_**

The Euro is the functional currency used for the consolidated financial statements; however, the Group carries
out operations in currencies other than the Euro, principally in US Dollars, with an exposure therefore to
currency risk.

The risk management policy seeks to reduce the impact on Group margins and cash flows from currency
movements, minimizing at the same time protection costs against these events in terms of the pre-chosen hedging
instruments. For commercial or financial transactions in currencies other than the Euro, the currency risk
managed concerns fluctuations in the exchange rate between the agreement of the commercial/financial operation
and its receipt/payment.

F-70


-----

**_Interest rate risk_**

The exposure to interest rate risk relates essentially to loans agreed at variable rates. This risk concerns the
possibility that an increase in market rates results in higher interest charges.

This type of hedge seeks to minimize interest rate changes generated by loans at variable rates. The exposure to
interest rate risk is calculated on the basis of the loan repayment plans and the parameters used to calculate
interest.

Specifically, the Group—in accordance with the requirements of accounting standard OIC 32—accounted for
hedging transactions according to the hedge accounting criterion for the management of the following financial
risks:

As of December 31, 2020 Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. has in place an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) for a notional total
amount of € 48.5 million (€ 52.5 million and € 56.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively)
with Banca Intesa San Paolo and Banco BPM with maturity on December 31, 2021, in order to hedge the risk of
interest rate fluctuations relating to the loan. The IRS derivative contracts are used to convert floating rate loans
to fixed rate loans.

As of December 31, 2020 Itelyum Purification S.r.l. has in place an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) for a notional total
amount of € 35.8 million (€ 38.9 million and € 41.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively)
with Banca Intesa San Paolo and Banco BPM with maturity on December 31, 2022, in order to hedge the risk of
interest rate fluctuations relating to the loan. The IRS derivative contracts are used to convert floating rate loans
to fixed rate loans.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

**To the Board of Directors of**
**SSCP Green Holdings SCA**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of SSCP Green Holdings SCA and its subsidiaries (the
“Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and the
consolidated cash flow statement for the years then ended and the explanatory notes.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated
financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and of its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with the Italian GAAP.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
_Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of SSCP Green Holdings SCA (the “Company”)_
in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**Emphasis of Matter**

We draw attention to note 5 “Significant accounting policies - Revaluation as allowed by Italian Law n. 126 of
October 13, 2020” of the consolidated financial statements, which describes the effects of the revaluation of
selected property, plant and equipment carried out as at December 31, 2020 by certain Italian subsidiaries of the
Group. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Responsibilities of the Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance the Italian GAAP and, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as the
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless they have identified the existence of the conditions for the liquidation of the
Company or the termination of the business or have no realistic alternatives to such choices.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

    - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

    - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.

    - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a
going concern.

    - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

    - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA
Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
