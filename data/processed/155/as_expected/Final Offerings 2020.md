You are reminded that the offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a
person into whose possession the offering memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the
laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the
offering memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer
or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires


-----

that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the
Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be
made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the respective Issuer in such jurisdiction.
Under no circumstances shall the offering memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an
offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is
for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments
(being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’)), (ii) are persons
falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (‘‘high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.’’) of the
Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation
or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as ‘‘relevant
persons’’). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or
relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons. No part of this offering memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or
otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000)
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which
Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us.

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, nor any of
their directors, officers, employees or agents, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of
any difference between the offering memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy
version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes described in the attached offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that:
(i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined
in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling
or recommending such Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered or sold and should not be offered or sold to any retail investor in
the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the ‘‘Prospectus
**Regulation’’). No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the**
‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors
in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the
basis that any offer of such debt securities in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
such debt securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of Notes
which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Managers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the
Managers have authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of Notes in circumstances in
which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Managers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

# Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH E500,000,000 3.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2027

Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH, organized as a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung) under the laws of the Federal
Republic of Germany (the ‘‘Issuer’’ or the ‘‘Company’’), is offering (the ‘‘Offering’’) A500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% senior
secured notes due 2027 (the ‘‘Notes’’). The gross proceeds from the Offering together with cash on hand will be used to (i) repay certain of our
existing indebtedness (including accrued and unpaid interest as well as premiums, prepayment fees and breakage costs, if any), (ii) finance the
purchase price for the Sake Acquisition (as defined herein) and (iii) pay costs, fees and expenses related to the Transactions (as defined herein).

The Notes will mature on February 11, 2027. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.500% per annum and the Issuer will pay interest on the Notes
semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15, commencing August 15, 2020. Prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to
redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date and the applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ premium, as described in this
offering memorandum (the ‘‘Offering Memorandum’’). Some or all the Notes may also be redeemed at any time on or after February 15, 2023 at the
redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem at its option up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 103.500% plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided that at least 60% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes (as defined herein)) remains outstanding after the redemption.
Prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem in each calendar year up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including any
Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any.

If the Issuer experiences a change of control (as described in this Offering Memorandum), the holders of the Notes will have the right to require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase all the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if
holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase at a price equal to the highest price (excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) paid to each other holder of such Notes. In
addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer
that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis with limited recourse
by CheplaFinance 2 GmbH (the ‘‘Parent Guarantor’’), the immediate holding company of the Issuer (the ‘‘Guarantee’’). The Parent Guarantor also
guarantees certain obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined herein) on a pari passu basis. As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be
secured by (i) a first-priority pledge over all the shares in the Issuer, (ii) a first-priority assignment of claims under shareholder loans granted by the
Parent Guarantor to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (iii) a first-priority assignment by the Issuer of payment claims against its Restricted
Subsidiaries, (iv) a first-priority pledge over the Issuer’s bank accounts kept in Germany and (v) a first-priority pledge over certain stock in listed
companies held by the Issuer for investment purposes (the ‘‘Collateral’’). The validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and the security interests
over the Collateral and the liability of the Parent Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and Security Interests’’ The security interests in favor of the Notes and the Guarantee_
may be released under certain circumstances. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness or other obligations of
the Issuer that are secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
indebtedness or other obligations, will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes, and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of any subsidiaries of the Issuer.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the ‘‘Authority’’)
for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’). There can be no
assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained.
**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 24.**

**Price for the Notes: 100.0% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date**

The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. We expect that
the Notes will be delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear System (‘‘Euroclear’’) and Clearstream Banking, soci´et´e anonyme (‘‘Clearstream’’)
on or about February 11, 2020 (the ‘‘Issue Date’’).

**This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or**
**solicitation is unlawful. The Notes and the Guarantee have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the**
**‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The offering of the Notes is being made only in the United States to qualified**
**institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’) and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance**
**on Regulation S under the Securities Act (‘‘Regulation S’’) to persons other than retail investors in the European Economic Area, each defined as a**
**person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); or (ii) a**
**customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a**
**professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as**
**amended, the ‘‘Prospectus Regulation’’). For a description of certain restrictions on the transfer of the Notes, see ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’ and ‘‘Transfer**

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or
purchase any of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any
person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to
permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose. Accordingly,
the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and this Offering Memorandum may not be
distributed, in any jurisdiction except in accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such
jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws that apply to you in any place in which you buy, offer or sell any
Notes or possess this Offering Memorandum. You must also obtain any consents or approvals that you
need in order to purchase any Notes. Neither we nor Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan
Securities plc, HSBC Bank plc or UniCredit Bank AG (the ‘‘Initial Purchasers’’) is responsible for your
compliance with these legal requirements. See also ‘‘—Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors’’, ‘‘—Notice to

Offering Memorandum is, or should be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the Initial
Purchasers, the trustees, or any other agents acting with respect to the Notes as to the past or the future.

By receiving this Offering Memorandum, you acknowledge that you have not relied on the Initial
Purchasers or their respective directors, affiliates, agents or advisors in connection with your investigation
of the accuracy of this information or your decision whether to invest in the Notes. By purchasing the
Notes, you will be deemed to have acknowledged that you have reviewed this Offering Memorandum and
have had an opportunity to request, and have received all additional information that you need from us.
No person is authorized in connection with any offering made by this Offering Memorandum to give any
information or to make any representation not contained in this Offering Memorandum or any pricing
term sheet or supplement and, if given or made, any other information or representation must not be
relied upon as having been authorized by us or the Initial Purchasers.

The information contained in this Offering Memorandum is as of the date hereof. Neither the delivery of

Memorandum.

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘‘SEC’’), any state securities commission nor

The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, and has submitted this Offering

required to update the information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in our business,
financial condition or results of operations and prospects. We cannot guarantee that the application for the
Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved as of the settlement date for the
Notes or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not conditional on obtaining this listing.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**_European Economic Area_**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in a
Member State of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum
may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Managers to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation in relation to such offer. Neither
the Issuer nor the Managers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Managers to publish a prospectus for such
offer. The expression ‘‘Prospectus Regulation’’ means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended.

**_Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling
or recommending such Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target

iv


-----

market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered or distributed to and should not be offered or sold to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. No key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

**_Germany_**

The Offering is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Notes may not be offered
and sold in the Federal Republic of Germany except in accordance with the provisions of the Securities
Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended, the ‘‘German
**Securities Prospectus Act’’), of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, and any other laws applicable in Germany. This**
Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved
by, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f¨ur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht)
(‘‘BaFin’’). BaFin has not obtained and will not obtain a notification from another competent authority of
a Member State, with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Section 17 Para. 3 of
the German Securities Prospectus Act. The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a
public offer, public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this Offering Memorandum and any other
document relating to the Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public
in Germany or used in connection with any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in Germany.
Consequently, in Germany the Notes will only be available to, and this Offering Memorandum and any
other offering material in relation to the Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors
(qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 6 of the German Securities Prospectus Act. Any
resale of the Notes in Germany may only be made in accordance with the German Securities Prospectus
Act and other applicable laws.

**_Switzerland_**

The Notes may not be publicly offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in or from Switzerland.

Neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Notes
constitutes a prospectus as such term is understood pursuant to article 652a or article 1156 of the Swiss
Code of Obligations or a listing prospectus within the meaning of the listing rules of the SIX Swiss
Exchange or any other regulated trading facility in Switzerland, and neither this offering memorandum nor
any other offering or marketing material relating to the Notes may be publicly distributed or otherwise
made publicly available in Switzerland.

Neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the offering
nor the Issuer nor the Notes has been or will be filed with or approved by any Swiss regulatory authority.

supervision by such authority.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws
of certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all
statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Offering Memorandum, including,
without limitation, those regarding our future financial position and results of operations, our strategy,
plans, objectives, goals and targets, future developments in the markets in which we participate or are
seeking to participate or anticipated regulatory changes in the markets in which we operate or intend to
operate. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as ‘‘aim’’,
‘‘anticipate’’, ‘‘believe’’, ‘‘continue’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘estimate’’, ‘‘expect’’, ‘‘forecast’’, ‘‘guidance’’, ‘‘intend’’,
‘‘may’’, ‘‘plan’’, ‘‘potential’’, ‘‘predict’’, ‘‘projected’’, ‘‘should’’, or ‘‘will’’ or the negative of such terms or
other comparable terminology.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.
We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based
on numerous assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and
liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be
more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this
Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and
liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking
statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative
of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that
could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:

- the ability to operate in competitive markets with significant price pressure;

- cost-containment reform measures by government health authorities;

- compliance with regulatory environment in various markets;

- risks associated with our business model, including our ability to acquire new products;

- the ability to integrate new products into manufacturing, distribution and sales processes;

- the ability to implement planned improvements and achieve operational excellence;

- the dependency on third parties for the manufacture, storage, distribution and marketing of products;

- default and counterparty risk of major third-parties;

- the ability to maintain the strength of our brands;

- risks associated with product liability and licensing;

- risks related to compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to
our business;

- risks related to proprietary rights and other litigation or claims;

- risks associated with insurance policies;

- tax risks associated with tax audits and tax legislation;

- ability to service our debt obligations and finance future operations;

- the covenants contained in the Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, which limit our
operating and financial flexibility;

- risks related to our group structure;

viii


-----

- other risks associated with the transaction, our financial profile, the Notes, our structure and the
financing; and

- other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

The risks described in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other
sections of this Offering Memorandum include additional factors that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. New risks may also emerge from time to time, and it is not
possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the
extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled ‘‘Risk Factors,
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, ‘‘Industry’’ and
‘‘Our Business’’ for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and
the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking
events described in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. Accordingly,
prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date on which the statements were made. In addition, from time to time we and our
representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking
statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited
to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other communications.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable,
there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statement or risk
factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and
contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

is not guaranteed. We believe such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this Offering
Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by the
above-listed third-party sources, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced

the industry in which we operate and our position within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or
verified externally. While we assume that our own market observations are reliable, we give no warranty

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin,
EBITDA before non-recurring items, EBITDA before non-recurring items margin, Adjusted EBITDA,
Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion Rate, Financial Indebtedness, Net Financial Indebtedness, As adjusted
Net Financial Indebtedness, capital expenditure, net working capital and sales.

We define ‘‘EBITDA before non-recurring items’’ as results of operating activities before amortization,
depreciation and impairments and certain adjustments as described under footnote (1) of ‘‘Summary—
_Summary Financial and Other Information—Summary Other Financial Data’’._

We define ‘‘EBITDA margin’’ as EBITDA divided by revenue.

We define ‘‘EBITDA before non-recurring items margin’’ as EBITDA before non-recurring items divided
by revenue.

We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as EBITDA before non-recurring items as adjusted for the estimated
EBITDA of the Recently Acquired Products, which we acquired at various points of time between
October 1, 2018 and the date of this Offering Memorandum, as if they had occurred on October 1, 2018.

We define ‘‘Free Cash Flow’’ as EBITDA before non-recurring items plus/less decrease/increase in
inventories, plus/less decrease/increase in trade receivables, plus/less decrease/increase in other current
assets, plus/less increase/decrease in trade payables, plus/less increase/decrease in other liabilities, plus/less
change in financial assets less acquisitions of property, plant and equipment.

We define ‘‘Cash Conversion Rate’’ as Free Cash Flow divided by EBITDA before non-recurring items.

We define ‘‘Financial Indebtedness’’ as the sum of current and non-current other financial debts and
mezzanine loan notes.

We define ‘‘Net Financial Indebtedness’’ as Financial Indebtedness less securities and bank balances and
cash-in-hand.

We define ‘‘As adjusted Net Financial Indebtedness’’ as Net Financial Indebtedness adjusted to give effect
to the Transactions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2019.

We define ‘‘capital expenditure’’ as the sum of additions to intangible assets and additions to property,

We define ‘‘net working capital’’ as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables.

We define ‘‘sales’’ as revenues before deducting rebates and (cash) discounts.

The non-IFRS financial measures and related ratios contained in this Offering Memorandum should not
be considered in isolation and are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and
should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, profit or loss for the period or any other
performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating,
investing or financing activities or any other measure of our liquidity derived in accordance with IFRS.
Non-IFRS financial measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available
for cash requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations. These non-IFRS financial
measures are neither audited nor reviewed.

In addition, certain non-IFRS financial measures, as we define them, may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures used by other companies. We believe that EBITDA and the other non-IFRS
financial measures presented in this Offering Memorandum represent useful indicators of our financial
performance when read in addition to IFRS financial measures indicating our financial performance. You
should exercise caution in comparing the non-IFRS financial measures as reported by us to such measures,
similar measures or adjusted variations thereof reported by other companies.

-----

In particular, our EBITDA-based measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider
them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS
as set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These limitations include, among other things:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; and

- other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash
available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations, including under the Notes. You should rely primarily on our results reported under
IFRS and use these non-IFRS financial measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance.

The unaudited consolidated statement of income information and the other financial information
presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 have been derived by subtracting the
comparative financial information of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Company’s internal accounting system for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the financial
information of the 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Issuer’s internal accounting
system for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, and adding the financial information of the
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company’s internal accounting system for
the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The unaudited consolidated income statement information
and the other financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 have been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily representative of our results of operations
for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. This data has been prepared solely for
the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial
reporting and has not been audited or reviewed.

**Non-Financial Operating Data**

Certain non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum are derived from
management estimates, are not part of our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements or financial accounting records, and have not been audited or
otherwise reviewed by our auditors or other outside consultants or experts. Our use or computation of
these terms may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by
other companies. Any or all these terms should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure
of performance.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information presented
in millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding
adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary from the actual
arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods
relating to financial and other information set forth in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations’’ are calculated using the numerical data (in thousands) in the_

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary contains basic information about us and this offering and is qualified by, and should be_
_read in conjunction with, the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._
_This summary is not complete and does not contain all the information that you should consider before_
_investing in the Notes. For a more complete understanding of this offering, we encourage you to read this entire_
_Offering Memorandum carefully, including ‘‘Risk Factors’’, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, ‘‘Business’’, ‘‘Regulation’’ and our financial statements and_
_the notes to those financial statements contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Overview**

We are a leading specialty pharmaceuticals company headquartered in Greifswald, Germany, with an
international footprint and a broad portfolio of more than 90 products across more than ten therapeutic
areas, including cardiology, oncology and infectious diseases. We focus on acquiring well established,
off-patent, branded legacy and niche originator pharmaceutical products with predictable cash flows from
large pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies regularly seek to dispose of these products to
reduce the complexity of their product portfolio and because these products no longer fit their business
model, even if still profitable. They seek reliable and experienced buyers, such as us, to dispose of these
products given that maintaining market supply is paramount to mitigate potential reputational risk. We
have a strong track record of ensuring uninterrupted supply, and are typically able to generate additional
value from these well established, off-patent branded legacy and niche originator products by reducing
complexity and costs throughout the value chain. We achieve that due to our lean setup, including
outsourced manufacturing, as well as through our outsourced global distribution capabilities. Since our
inception in 1998, we have established relationships with more than ten different pharmaceutical
companies by acquiring their products. We believe that our track record of successful acquisitions and our
proven ability to integrate new products into our business in a timely and seamless manner make us a
preferred partner for many large pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb
and Roche.

We operate a lean business model focused on (i) selecting and acquiring suitable off-patent, branded niche
or legacy originator products or product portfolios that fit our disciplined acquisition criteria, (ii) managing
the transfer of the required approvals to market them across various countries and (iii) integrating them
into our established value chain of contract manufacturing organizations (‘‘CMOs’’) and distributors. With
no own manufacturing facilities or sales force, our asset light business model typically enables us to reduce
production as well as sales and marketing costs by outsourcing production and distribution of our products
to third parties. Our large network of CMOs allows us to choose the partner which is able to offer the
lowest production costs and best quality for a specific product or pharmaceutical form. In addition, we may
be able to achieve economies of scale and negotiate favorable terms with CMOs by bundling the
production of various products with the same CMO.

We distribute our products in more than 120 countries across six continents, predominantly through our
extensive network of distribution partners, with many of whom we have long-standing relationships. Not
maintaining our own distribution capabilities in the majority of the countries we operate in allows us to
choose local distribution partners who we believe are best suited for a specific product and to focus on the
most efficient distribution channel. At the same time, we may be able to realize efficiencies by bundling the
distribution of various products with the same distribution partner.

Given our business model and the off-patent status of our products, we do not develop products and have
no research and development (‘‘R&D’’) activities of our own. Therefore, we are not exposed to the
significant risks and upfront investments that are associated with the development of new pharmaceutical
products. In addition, given that our products have typically been on the market and off-patent for a
prolonged time, there is a very limited need to invest in product improvements, line extensions or similar
measures.

8JAN202011315651

- Shares in sales of Xenical�, Lexotan�, Cymeveme� and Visudyne� in Switzerland as well as of Atacand� in Sweden are
influenced by the geographic location of sellers under the transitional services agreements (Roche and Novartis in
Switzerland and AstraZeneca in Sweden).

As a result of this diversification, we are not dependent on a single product or geography. Our products are
used by a diverse customer base including consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, mail-order
companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as well as
public or private health insurance organizations. We estimate that our primary customer groups are
physicians, hospitals and patients paying for their products ‘out-of-pocket’. Our products typically also
benefit from a loyal customer base which has used or prescribed the product for many years and, therefore,
is less likely to switch to a different product. We believe that these ‘‘pull factors’’ are particularly
characteristic of prescription drugs, sales of which represented approximately 94% of our sales for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 with approximately 5% being generated from the sale of OTC products.
Finally, competition for our products is often limited or well-known. Our products have typically been
off-patent for several years and the competitive landscape has settled by the time we acquire the products.
This is because generic products are typically launched immediately after patent protection for the
originator product expired. Accordingly, the sales decline for an originator product is most severe
immediately following expiry of patent protection and hence, by the time we acquire a branded originator
product, the risk of new products entering the market is relatively low, driven by non-compelling
economics for new entrants given the niche or legacy nature of the sub-segment of the pharmaceutical
industry in which we operate.

Our business has grown significantly in recent years. We have increased our revenues and EBITDA before
non-recurring items from A132.5 million and A69.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2016 to A460.6 million and A253.9 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.
During the same period, we achieved an average EBITDA before non-recurring items margin of 53.4%. In
addition, our asset light business model allowed us to realize a Cash Conversion Ratio of 64.1% for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We believe that the future growth of our business is supported by a number of favorable long-term trends.
We expect that there will continue to be attractive acquisition candidates available to us as a result of large
pharmaceutical companies reducing the complexity of their portfolio and focusing on newer patented
products. This expectation is underpinned by a substantial proportion of currently marketed
pharmaceutical products for which patent protection will expire by 2024, a trend expected to continue in
later years as ‘‘blockbuster’’ and other drugs lose patent protection, as well as the continuing trend toward
mergers & acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry, which we expect will result in the realignment of
product portfolios. At the same time, we expect that the broader pharmaceutical industry will continue to
grow in the future as a result of rising medical needs driven by a growing and ageing population, the
availability of new and innovative products addressing previously unmet medical needs, the expansion in
the awareness and availability of healthcare and increasing national income in emerging markets.

**Our Strengths**

**_Differentiated and low-risk business model given proven, mature products with a stable competitive_**
**_environment and an established customer base_**

We focus on acquiring original, well established, off-patent branded legacy and niche originator
pharmaceutical products which have been on the market for many years and for which patent protection
expired several years ago. We believe such products offer attractive opportunities with limited risk, given
the long prescription track record, well understood side effects and lower litigation risk. Such products are
also characterized by stable customer bases and visibility on revenue streams, long phase-out periods and a
strong ‘‘pull effect’’ (i.e., limited to no marketing required as brands are well established and have a high
degree of loyalty or familiarity with the prescriber or end user). We believe that these factors also reduce
the risk of new competitors entering the market for our products, given the non-compelling economics for
a new entrant, as the competitive landscape has settled and introducing a new product would entail
significant costs.

Our product portfolio comprises well established, off-patent branded ‘‘legacy’’ originator products and
‘‘niche’’ originator products, sales of which each represented approximately half of our sales for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019. Niche products benefit from limited or no competition due to the
overall limited market size and scale constraints for generic companies and are unlikely to be replaced by
new treatment alternatives. Legacy products are frequently higher volume drugs covering broader market
segments and diseases, face more competition from generic products, as compared to the competition
faced by niche products, given larger market size and earnings potential, but benefit from a strong ‘‘pull
effect’’ due to the long track record in the market as the originator product. Our products are also
predominantly prescription drugs and we believe that the ‘‘pull effect’’ is more prevalent for prescription
drugs.

Given our products’ long time in market and safety history, combined with sticky customer bases, high
brand awareness and long phase-out periods, such branded niche and legacy originator products generate
more predictable revenue and cash flows compared to new pharmaceutical products, while having limited
drug-specific downside risks, such as litigation. As we do not engage in R&D, we are neither exposed to
R&D risk nor to the upfront investments associated with R&D activities.

**_Leading position in most relevant markets and a preferred partner for global pharmaceutical companies with_**
**_the ability to execute and integrate complex product acquisitions_**

With our extensive track record of acquisitions, ability to swiftly negotiate and execute acquisitions, global
distribution partner network and knowledge of regulatory and pharmacovigilance matters, we believe we
are a preferred partner for leading global pharmaceutical companies seeking to divest off-patent
pharmaceutical products. Since 2003, when we were acquired by the Braun family and our current Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer joined the Group, we have established relationships with
more than ten different pharmaceutical companies by acquiring their products, including AstraZeneca,
GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Teva, Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb. We believe that we have particularly
strong relationships with Roche and, more recently, AstraZeneca as we have acquired multiple products or
products bundles from each of them during the last years.

These relationships are further strengthened by our ability to swiftly negotiate and execute acquisitions due
to fast decision making processes, our dedicated team of experts and our long track record. We follow a

3


-----

disciplined, standardized and proven acquisition process with acquisition criteria that have been largely
unchanged for more than 15 years. Given our lean structures and the fact that our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Scientific Officer are also our shareholders, we are in a position to evaluate and agree
acquisition opportunities quickly.

Large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focused on divesting product bundles—across product
types, therapeutic areas and geographies—instead of single product divestments. We believe that we are
one of only a few companies with the knowhow and experience necessary to execute such complex product
portfolio acquisitions in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, our global distribution network helps to
ensure ongoing product availability in existing markets, which is a central decision-making factor for sellers
seeking to minimize reputational risk from stock-out situations.

Due to these relationships and our track record of acquisitions, we believe we have been able to acquire
products with strong positions in relatively large markets, in particular through our acquisitions of
Xenical� (which we acquired in 2016), Dilatrend� (which we acquired in 2017), Atacand� (which we
acquired in 2018) and Lexotan� (which we acquired in 2019), which we estimate to have market shares in
the countries in which we distribute the relevant product of approximately 33%, 40%, 20% and 56%,
respectively in the territory in which we market the respective product.

**_Ability to integrate new products into global network and create value_**

With over 80 acquisitions spanning a time period of more than 20 years, we have an extensive track record
of integrating acquired products into our network thereby optimizing product potential and contribution
margins. We have a large team of scientific and regulatory experts, which we have continued to expand in
recent years in line with our growth. As of September 30, 2019, over 60% of our full time equivalent
employees were active in our core functions regulatory, pharmacovigilance and quality control. This team
of in-house experts manages the transfer of required marketing authorizations in a timely manner and
enables us to integrate newly acquired products into our existing network of CMOs and distributors
efficiently. We believe that this track record, combined with our strong in-house capabilities in critical core
areas, make it relatively difficult for new entrants to replicate our business model.

We generate additional value from newly acquired products through a number of key levers, typically
including reduced overhead costs (such as sales and marketing expenses) and complexity (for example
through centralized marketing authorization management), lower production costs (by outsourcing
production to CMOs), optimized manufacturing arrangements and active pricing strategies. Product cost
optimization through outsourced production by CMOs and, in turn, reduced production costs is the most
important value lever and typically accounts for most of the cost savings we are able to achieve.

Our distribution platform comprises global partners with distribution capabilities in more than 120
countries, which allows us to ensure product availability across existing markets. We are also able to realize
additional potential from our products by choosing a distributor who is best suited for a given product or
bundling the distribution of several products with the same distributor.

**_Diversified revenue base and good revenue visibility_**

Our diversified revenue base helps to limit our exposure to regulatory risk in individual healthcare markets
by geography and therapeutic area. We estimate that approximately one-third of our revenues are linked to
products for which patients pay out-of-pocket. In addition, our focus on prescription pharmaceutical
products, which accounted for approximately 94% of our sales for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, provides us with good revenue visibility based on the established nature of the product in the market,
the relative stability of prescription patterns and the more limited substitution risk due to physicians’ and
patients’ familiarity with the product. Moreover, we estimate that more than half of our revenues are
generated by sales of ‘‘niche’’ products with limited or no competition in the market.

**_Asset light business model with limited capital expenditure requirements and strong cash flow generation_**

We operate an asset light business model characterized by no own manufacturing operations and no
involvement in R&D activities. In addition, we outsource a significant portion of our distribution to third
parties under long-term contracts, which allows us to maintain a low fixed cost base with limited capital
expenditure requirements beyond investments in selective acquisitions of new products.

The combination of our low fixed cost base and limited capital expenditure requirements support a
scalable business model and high EBITDA margins and cash conversion rates. In the financial years ended
December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our EBITDA margin
amounted to 52.5%, 56.2%, 58.4% and 53.9%, respectively. For the same periods, our Cash Conversion
Rate was 79.8%, 69.2%, 56.2% and 76.1%, respectively.

We also believe that our business model is scalable and able to generate significant economies of scale. The
complexity of integrating and managing new products is primarily driven by the number of marketing
authorizations that are required to be transferred in each country that the product is sold in and the need
to ensure uninterrupted supply rather than the sales volume of the acquired product. Our expertise,
experience and knowhow in the transfer of marketing authorizations as well as our existing global
distribution network therefore allows us to efficiently integrate new products at relatively low additional
fixed costs. Since 2016, we have successfully transferred approximately 475 different marketing
authorizations to us.

**_Highly qualified and committed management team with excellent track record_**

Our senior management team has been instrumental in the success of our buy-and-build strategy, with a
track record of more than 90 successful acquisitions with a cumulative acquisition value exceeding
A1.8 billion since the acquisition of Cheplapharm by the Braun family in 2003. Our senior management
team is supported by dedicated managers who have significant experience in regulatory and
pharmacovigilance affairs and a team of highly-qualified personnel, approximately 55% of which have an
academic degree.

We are also a family-owned company and benefit from the long-term commitment of our shareholder, the
Braun family, which include our Chief Executive Officer, Sebastian Braun, and Chief Scientific Officer,
Bianca Juha, who have consistently supported our growth through the reinvestment of retained earnings in
the business in lieu of dividends. They are complemented by our Chief Operating Officer, Edeltraud Lafer,
who has nearly 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry, and our Chief Financial Officer, Jens
Rothstein, who has served in that role since 2012.

**Our Strategy**

**_Pursue selective growth opportunities through disciplined acquisitions and continue to strengthen our existing_**
**_integration platform_**

We intend to continue to grow our business through disciplined and selective acquisitions of well
established, off-patent branded niche and legacy originator pharmaceutical products in line with our
time-tested acquisition strategy. As a result of upcoming patent expiries for a considerable amount of
products, we expect to continue to find ample opportunities for acquisitions of new products in the
medium term. We will continue to leverage our regulatory and pharmacovigilance expertise to identify new
products with predictable revenues as well as limited risks and competition. In addition, we remain focused
on products with potential for production cost optimization and contribution margin improvement.

Our acquisition strategy includes key criteria such as:

- **Valuation: Less than 3.5 times annual sales;**

- **Remaining economic life: Products which we do not believe will be replaced and will remain**
economically viable for more than ten years;

- **Return on Investment: We target an EBITDA margin of more than 50% with the aim to recover our**
investment within between 4 to 5.5 years (on an EBITDA basis and without taking into account
potential improvements from complexity and cost reduction or other key value levers);

- **Presence of the pull effect: Brands that are well established in the market and have a high degree of**
loyalty or familiarity with the end user, thereby requiring limited or no marketing efforts which are
necessary for ‘push’ products;

- **Market position: The product should have either a ‘niche’ position providing opportunity for growth or**
otherwise be available at extremely attractive prices such as legacy products;

- **Production: Should be ensured in the long-term; and**

- **Balanced product portfolio: Maintaining our diversified product portfolio by limiting the incremental**
sales contribution from each acquired product to a size which is adequate compared to the revenue of
our overall product portfolio at the time.

-----

In line with our expected growth, we plan to continue to enhance our product integration capabilities, in
particular by expanding our regulatory, pharmacovigilance and quality control functions. In order to
manage our expected growth more efficiently, we intend to outsource certain functions for which third
parties are better suited or utilize freelance work, as deemed appropriate.

**_Further strengthen market position and remain a partner of choice to leading pharmaceutical companies for_**
**_the acquisition of off-patent, branded legacy and niche originator products_**

We seek to maintain and strengthen our relationships with the leading global pharmaceutical companies as
we focus on expanding our market position as a leading specialty pharmaceutical company. We believe our
longstanding experience and proven track record in the industry, together with our extensive global
distribution network, make us a preferred partner to pharmaceutical companies seeking to divest
well-established, off-patent branded legacy or niche originator products. We aim to further strengthen
those relationships by maintaining our global distribution channels to ensure continued product availability
in existing markets.

In addition, our background as a family-owned business with flat hierarchies and fast decision-making
processes provides us with a competitive advantage when bidding for products and we intend to leverage
this advantage further going forward.

Moreover, we will continue to build on our expertise and track record in marketing authorization transfers
across the world to become the clear partner of choice for pharmaceutical companies focused on a global
divestment of bundles of products rather than individual products. By strengthening our relationships with
the leading global pharmaceutical companies, we believe we will be able to ensure a continuous, strong
acquisition pipeline of potential product candidates and further improve our global market position.

**_Maintain a prudent financial policy based on high cash conversion rates and supported by our shareholders’_**
**_long-term commitment_**

We intend to maintain a prudent financial policy based on high cash conversion rates and selective
acquisitions and supported by the long-term commitment of our shareholders. We target a ratio of
EBITDA after non-recurring items to Net Financial Indebtedness of 3.75x to 4.25x. We believe that our
high Cash Conversion Rate, which was 79.8%, 69.2%, 56.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017
and 2018, respectively, and 76.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, combined with the
discretionary nature of our acquisition activities, would allow us to de-lever the Group swiftly, if these
leverage ratios would temporarily be exceeded.

Our financial policy is further underpinned by the long-term commitments of our shareholders. Since its
acquisition by the Braun family in 2003, the Company has never paid a dividend to its shareholders and we
currently do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We aim to maintain adequate liquidity
at all times through our Revolving Credit Facility and significantly cash generative business model.

**The Transactions**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue A500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The
gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes together with cash on hand will be used to (i) repay the
Bridge Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility in full (including, in each case, accrued and unpaid
interest as well as premiums, prepayment fees and breakage costs, if any) (the ‘‘Refinancing
**Indebtedness’’), (ii) finance the purchase price for the Sake Acquisition (as defined below) and (iii) pay**
costs, fees and expenses related to the offer of the Notes and the Sake Acquisition. The offering of the
Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom are together referred to as the ‘‘Transactions’’. See ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization’’._

**Recent Developments**

**_Recent Acquisitions and Related Financing Transactions_**

In October 2019, we agreed to acquire a portfolio of four products (the ‘‘Gold Portfolio’’), including in the
therapeutic areas of oncology and incontinence, from Sanofi for an aggregate purchase price of
A66.5 million. The acquisition includes marketing authorizations in certain European countries, Argentina,
Canada, Japan and South Africa. Closing of the acquisition occurred on October 30, 2019 and we are in
the process of integrating the new products into our product portfolio. The acquisition of the product

7


-----

portfolio from Sanofi was financed from cash-in-hand as well as a drawdown under the Revolving Credit
Facility.

In October and November 2019, respectively, we entered into two agreements to acquire Seroquel�, a
product used to treat various mental disorders, from AstraZeneca for an aggregate purchase price of
USD 213 million plus sales-contingent payments of up to USD 67 million until 2026. The acquisitions
include marketing authorizations for Seroquel� in the United States, Europe, Canada and Russia. Closing
of the acquisitions occurred in December 2019. However, AstraZeneca has agreed to fully service
Seroquel� for three years following closing. Transfer of the relevant marketing authorizations and the
integration of Seroquel� into our manufacturing and distribution network is therefore not expected to
commence prior to three years after closing. The acquisition of Seroquel� was financed from cash-in-hand
as well as a drawdown under the USD 124 million Bridge Facility entered into in November 2019.

In November 2019, we agreed to acquire a portfolio of ten products (the ‘‘Sake Portfolio’’) in the
therapeutic areas of cardiology and intensive care from Sanofi for a provisional purchase price of
A102 million (the ‘‘Sake Acquisition’’). The provisional purchase price is subject to down-ward or up-ward
adjustment depending on the development of net sales between signing and closing. In addition, we agreed
to purchase the existing inventory from Sanofi at closing. Closing of the Sake Acquisition is subject to,
among other things, receipt of merger clearance, and is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2020.
We intend to finance the Sake Acquisition from the proceeds of the offering of the Notes. See ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds’’._

Also in November 2019, we agreed to purchase a 50% interest in ZR Pharma, a company that acquires and
markets off-patent pharmaceutical products. The total investment amounts to a high single digit million
figure. In December 2019, we agreed to acquire the marketing authorization and related trademarks for
Lexotan�, one of our existing products, in Japan.

**_Current Trading_**

Based on management estimates, our revenue and EBITDA for the two months ended November 30, 2019
amounted to approximately A102 million and A47 million, respectively. We estimate our revenues to be
significantly higher and our EBITDA to be slightly higher than in the comparable period in 2018. No
quantitative information for the two months ended November 30, 2018 is available as the Company did not
prepare IFRS compliant monthly management accounts in 2018. The increase was mainly due to the
completion of the acquisitions of Dormicum� and Lexotan� (from Roche) in January 2019. While the
acquisition of Losec� closed on September 30, 2019, our results for the two months ended November 30,
2019 do not include any revenue for Losec� as the relevant TSA only provides for quarterly payments.

The foregoing financial information is based on internal unaudited consolidated monthly accounts for the
months of October and November 2019, which were prepared by and are the responsibility of our
management. This financial information has not been audited, reviewed, compiled or the subject of any
procedures by our independent auditors or any other audit firm and no opinion nor any other form of
assurance is expressed with respect thereto. The foregoing financial information is inherently subject to
modification during the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2019. The presented financial information is not representative for any twelve-month period and should
not be regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding our future
financial performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and
‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a more complete discussion of certain factors that could affect our future performance
and results of operations.

_other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_
_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantee will be released_
_automatically and under which the Guarantee will be released_
_automatically, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the_
_consent of the Trustee’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Release of_
_Note Guarantees’’. The Guarantee may also be subject to_
contractual obligations and legal limitations. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
_The Guarantee and each security interest may be limited by applicable_
_law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability’’_ and ‘‘Certain _Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_

subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee, including
its obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and
certain hedging obligations;

              - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee;

Security, Enforcement of Security . Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement) and certain perfection requirements, as of
the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by (i) a first-priority
pledge over all the shares in the Issuer, (ii) a first-priority
assignment of claims under shareholder loans granted by the
Parent Guarantor to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
(iii) a first-priority assignment by the Issuer of payment claims
against its Restricted Subsidiaries, (iv) a first-priority pledge over
the Issuer’s bank accounts kept in Germany and (v) a first-priority
pledge over certain stock in listed companies held by the Issuer for
investment purposes (the ‘‘Collateral’’), as described in more detail
under ‘‘Description of the Notes—General—Security; _Release of_
_Collateral’’._

References to first-priority security interests include security
interests that were created subsequent in time and thus in ranking,
but are contractually _pari passu with prior ranking security and_
entitled to equal treatment with other prior ranking security
secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Certain of the security
_interests granted in favor of the holders of the Notes will not rank pari_
_passu with the security interests granted in favor of the lenders under_
_the Senior Facilities Agreement and holders of the Notes are relying on_
_the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve a first priority lien in respect of_
_the Collateral securing the Notes’’._

The Collateral also secures the Senior Facilities Agreement and
certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis.

The security interests over the Collateral or the enforcement
thereof may be subject to certain significant legal limitations or
subject to certain defenses under applicable law. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—The Guarantee and each security interest may be limited by_
_applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity_
_and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations’’. Applicable law may require that a_
security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected
and its priority retained through certain actions which, in the case
of some Collateral, may not be completed until after the Issue
Date. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The security
_interests in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to_
_perfect security interests in the Collateral’’._

The security interests may be released under certain circumstances.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There are
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under_
_which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantee will be_
_released automatically and under which the Guarantee will be released_
_automatically, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the_
_consent of the Trustee’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the_
_Notes—General—Security; Release of Collateral’’._

Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The gross proceeds from the Offering together with cash on hand
will be used to (i) repay the Refinancing Indebtedness (including
accrued and unpaid interest as well as premiums, prepayment fees
and breakage costs, if any), (ii) finance the purchase price for the
Sake Acquisition and (iii) pay costs, fees and expenses related to
the Transactions. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’.

Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or
after February 15, 2023 at the redemption prices described under
‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption’’.

At any time prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem on
any one or more occasions all or part of the Notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, plus the
Applicable Premium, to but not including the date of redemption,
as described under ‘‘Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional_
_Redemption’’._

At any time prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem at
its option up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional
Notes) with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption price of 103.500% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to but not including the date of redemption, provided that at least
60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the
original principal amount of any Additional Notes) remains
outstanding.

At any time prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may in each
calendar year redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount
of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any.

See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption’’.

Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of
the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer, and the Issuer, or
any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have
the right to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but
not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price
(excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) paid to
each other holder of Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption’’._

Additional Amounts; Tax
Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor
in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee will be
made without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant
taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. Subject to certain
exceptions and limitations, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or the
paying agent is required by law to withhold or deduct such taxes
with respect to a payment on any Note, the Issuer or such
Guarantor will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net
amount received by each holder after such withholding is not less
than the amount that would have been received in the absence of
the withholding.

14


-----

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction
become effective after the issuance of the Notes that would impose
withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the
Notes, and would require the Issuer or any Guarantor to pay
additional amounts (as defined in ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes’’), the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but_
not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . If the Issuer experiences a change of control, the holders of the
Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase.
See ‘‘Description of the Notes’’.

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture will restrict the ability of the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries to:

              - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain
preferred stock;

              - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make other
distributions;

              - make certain other restricted payments or restricted
investments;

              - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

              - create or permit to exist certain liens;

              - impose restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries
to pay dividends;

              - transfer or sell certain assets;

              - merge or consolidate with other entities;

              - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and

              - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for so long as the
Notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Suspension of Covenants’’.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants’’._

Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes and the Guarantee have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See ‘‘Notice to Investors’’. We have not
agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes or the
Guarantee under the securities laws in any jurisdiction (including
by way of an exchange offer).

No Established Market for the
Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are
not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that an
active trading market will develop for the Notes. Furthermore, the
Notes will not have registration rights under the U.S. Securities
Act.

Authority Limited (the ‘‘Authority’’) for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’). There can be no
assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted
or that such listing will be maintained.

Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantee will be governed by
the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement is
governed by the laws of England and Wales. The security
documents will be governed by German law.

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of
an investment in the Notes, see ‘‘Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations’’. You should consult with your own tax_
advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax
consequences of an investment in the Notes.

expect will be delivered through Euroclear and Clearstream. See
‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’.

The unaudited consolidated income statement information and the other financial information presented
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 have been derived by subtracting the comparative
financial information of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company’s
internal accounting system for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the financial information
of the 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company’s internal accounting system for
the financial year ended December 31, 2018, and adding the financial information of the Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Company’s internal accounting system for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019. The unaudited consolidated income statement information and the
other financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 have been
prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily representative of our results of operations
for any financial year or for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. This data has

of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed.

The historical financial information marked as ‘‘audited’’ as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2018 is extracted from the 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The historical financial
information marked as ‘‘audited’’ as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 is extracted from
the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the historical financial information marked as
‘‘audited’’ as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 is extracted from the comparative
financial information for the prior year period presented in the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements. The financial information as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is
taken or derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements or from the Group’s
accounting records.

The following tables also set forth certain as adjusted consolidated financial information, after giving effect
to the Transactions (including the application of the proceeds as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’).

The financial information marked as ‘‘audited’’ in tables in this Offering Memorandum is extracted from
the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial information marked as ‘‘unaudited’’ in tables in
this Offering Memorandum is not extracted from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements but is

_and Other Information’’, ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’, ‘‘Capitalization’’, ‘‘Selected Consolidated Financial Information’’_

- Gives effect to the Transactions (including the application of the proceeds as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’).

(1) We define EBITDA as results of operating activities before amortization, depreciation and impairments. EBITDA before
non-recurring items represents EBITDA as adjusted for the adjustments set out below which management considers to be
non-recurring in nature, as we believe such costs are not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business. We present
EBITDA and EBITDA before non-recurring items as supplemental measures of our operating performance. We believe that
EBITDA and EBITDA before non-recurring items are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. Other
companies may calculate EBITDA and EBITDA before non-recurring items differently than we do. Therefore, you should
exercise caution in comparing EBITDA and EBITDA before non-recurring items as reported by us to EBITDA or EBITDA
before non-recurring items of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA before non-recurring items are not measurements of
financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA and EBITDA before
non-recurring items, as presented in this Offering Memorandum, may differ from, and may not be comparable to,
‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ contained in ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and in the Indenture. We present EBITDA and EBITDA
before non-recurring items for informational purposes only. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment
as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. EBITDA and EBITDA
before non-recurring items may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations for
the periods presented and may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements or the other financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. EBITDA and
EBITDA before non-recurring items have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. See

(a) Reflects the elimination of legal and other advisory fees incurred in connection with certain strategic initiatives, corporate
reorganizations and financing transactions. Does not include legal and other advisory fees incurred in connection with the
acquisition of new products. Legal and other advisory costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2018 mainly comprise financial advisory, legal and other fees incurred in connection with the
establishment of the Term Loan Facilities and Revolving Credit Facility in 2018 (A0.2 million) and legal and other
professional fees incurred in connection with the sale of the shares in Clearum GmbH (A0.2 million). Legal and other
advisory costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 mainly comprise legal fees and rating expenses incurred in
connection with the increase of the Term Loan Facilities in June 2019 (A0.8 million).

(b) Reflects adjustments to eliminate the effects of disposals of fixed and intangible assets. In the year ended December 31,
2018, we recorded gains of A10.4 million in connection with the sale of the marketing authorization and related
trademarks for Anexate� in Japan and of A3.9 million in connection with the sale of the marketing authorization and
related trademarks for Dilatrend� in Turkey as well as for Lanitop�/Talidat� (A0.3 million).

(2) EBITDA margin and EBITDA before non-recurring items margin represents EBITDA or EBITDA before non-recurring items,
as applicable, divided by revenue.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 represents EBITDA before non-recurring items as
adjusted for the estimated EBITDA contribution of the Recently Acquired Products, which we acquired or agreed to acquire at
various points of time between October 1, 2018 and the date of this Offering Memorandum. The estimated contribution to
EBITDA before non-recurring items excludes the EBITDA attributable to a Recently Acquired Product from the relevant
closing date of the acquisition to September 30, 2019, since, commencing with the respective closing date, the respective
Recently Acquired Products were part of our consolidation process and are therefore already included in EBITDA before
non-recurring items. Total actual EBITDA contribution of the Recently Acquired Products will be lower than the estimated
Adjusted EBITDA contribution indicated in the table below.

The following provides an overview of the estimated EBITDA contribution of each Recently Acquired Product for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2019:

   - Expected

The Adjusted EBITDA information for the Recently Acquired Products is for informational purposes only. This information
does not represent the results the Recently Acquired Products would have achieved had each of the acquisitions occurred on
October 1, 2018. The calculations of Adjusted EBITDA for each of the Recently Acquired Products are based in part on
information provided by the seller of the relevant Recently Acquired Product, due diligence and management estimates. The
EBITDA contribution of each of the Recently Acquired Products will be different from the respective Adjusted EBITDA
contribution indicated in the table above due to, among other things, the declining revenue profile of the Recently Acquired
Products which will result in lower EBITDA, particularly for products that have lost patent protection relatively recently and
are therefore subject to steeper sales declines, such as Seroquel�, as well as other circumstances set forth under ‘‘Risk Factors’’.
According to IMS, sales of Seroquel� declined at a CAGR of 28.0% in Europe and Russia and 55.9% in the United States and

21


-----

Canada between 2015 and 2018. This compares to declines of 8%, 7.4% and 14.8%, in our markets during 2015-2018 for
Losec�, the Gold Portfolio and the Sake Portfolio, respectively (according to IMS). See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Products—We face risks associated with our strategy of acquiring new products’’. The Adjusted EBITDA_
contributions have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information
is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or
results of operations attributable to the relevant Recently Acquired Products for periods prior to their acquisition, may not be
comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements or the other financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. The Adjusted EBITDA contribution of the
Recently Acquired Products is included in this Offering Memorandum as we believe that it presents a useful indication of the
results of operating activities of our present product portfolio; however, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial
performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to other indicators of our operating performance, cash
flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

The Adjusted EBITDA information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 was prepared using the following
methodology, which is similar to the methodology we applied when valuing the Recently Acquired Products in connection with
our decision to purchase the Recently Acquired Products:

  - We determined the revenue for each Recently Acquired Product on the basis of the historical revenue for such
product as provided to us by the seller (converted into euro where necessary). Such information is typically based on
management information which is neither reviewed nor audited by an independent auditor and does not take into
account any change in revenue since the end of the period for which the seller provides us with such information.

  - We determined the cost of materials and other selling expenses attributable to an Recently Acquired Product on the
basis of the historical cost of materials and other selling expenses provided to us by the seller (converted into euro
where necessary). Such information is typically based on management information which is neither reviewed nor
audited by an independent auditor. It also does not take into account any cost savings or other effects of efficiency
programs which we may implement after transfer of the relevant marketing authorization and the end of the TSA
phase.

  - For the period of time during which we expect that a product will be distributed by the seller under a TSA, we deduct
the service fees payable to the seller as agreed with the seller in the asset purchase agreement relating to the relevant
Recently Acquired Product.

  - We determined personnel expenses and other operating expenses attributable to an Recently Acquired Product by
estimating the additional expenses for scientific personnel (such as in the areas of regulatory affairs,
pharmacovigilance or quality control) that we expect to incur in connection with the relevant Recently Acquired
Product. The amount of additional personnel expenses we expect to incur depends on, among other things, the
number of marketing authorizations, the countries in which we expect to market a Recently Acquired Product as well
as the indication for the relevant Recently Acquired Product. Our estimate does not take into account other overhead
expenses that may be (indirectly) associated with a Recently Acquired Product.

  - The Adjusted EBITDA contribution of each Recently Acquired Product is then pro-rated to only reflect the period of
time from October 1, 2018 to the closing of the relevant acquisition.

(4) Free Cash Flow represents EBITDA before non-recurring items plus/less decrease/increase in inventories, plus/less decrease/
increase in trade receivables, plus/less decrease/increase in other current assets, plus/less increase/decrease in trade payables,
plus/less increase/decrease in other liabilities, plus/less change in financial assets less acquisitions of property, plant and
equipment. We present Free Cash Flow as a supplemental measure of our operating performance. We believe that Free Cash
Flow is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. Other companies may calculate Free Cash Flow differently
than we do. Therefore, you should exercise caution in comparing Free Cash Flow as reported by us to Free Cash Flow of other
companies. Free Cash Flow is not a measurement of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an
alternative to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in
accordance with IFRS. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information’’

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this_
_Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes._
_The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties_
_of which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition and results of operations. If any of the possible events described below were to occur, our_
_business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that_
_happens, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the_
_Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See ‘‘Forward-_
_Looking Statements’’._

**Risks Related to Our Industry and Market**

**_We operate in a competitive industry._**

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry which is driven by a
variety of factors, including price, local market expertise, reliability of product quality, efficiency of
distribution channels, breadth of product portfolio, our ability to meet and manage applicable regulation
and marketing authorizations, product purchase prices and sale prices, efficacy of marketing, quality of
packaging and levels of brand loyalty.

Many of our competitors are well-known pharmaceutical companies with substantial financial and other
resources. Companies with more resources may have a greater ability to conduct the development work
necessary to obtain marketing authorizations. Our products could, for example, be rendered obsolete or
uneconomical through the development of new products or technological advances in manufacturing or
production by our competitors. Our competitors’ products may also be, or be perceived as being, more
effective or more efficiently marketed and sold than our products. Our competitors may also be able to
sustain a deliberate substantial reduction in the price of their products or services for longer periods. This
is likely to result in significant price pressure in an increasingly commoditized market, which, in turn, may
reduce our sales and market share. In addition, competition in certain of our markets is particularly intense
due to the use of public tenders. Tender systems for pharmaceutical products have been implemented (by
both public and private entities) in a number of significant markets in which we operate in an effort to
lower prices. Under such tender systems, governments or private entities do not directly set the prices of
pharmaceutical products, rather pharmaceutical companies submit bids that establish prices for
pharmaceutical products and governments or private entities select a winning bidder. These measures
affect competition, marketing practices and reimbursement of drugs.

The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by continuous product development and technological
change. The introduction of a new pharmaceutical product in any of our product markets may make it
difficult for us to increase our market share, retain existing competitive positions. If we fail to maintain our
competitive position or if any of our competitors engage in pricing competition with us, there could be a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to
perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Existing and future healthcare cost-containment reform measures by government health authorities or government-_**
**_sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect our business._**

In various countries where we operate, government health authorities provide healthcare at low direct cost
to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the
government-sponsored healthcare system. The continuing increase in healthcare expenditure has therefore
been the subject of considerable government attention in many of the countries in which we operate,
particularly as public resources have been stretched since the global economic crisis. Further, in recent
years, the increasing average age of the population and the associated increasing demand for
pharmaceutical products has led to rising healthcare costs.

Increasing expenditure on healthcare has been the subject of considerable public attention. In recent years,
many countries across the globe have discussed or implemented a measure of healthcare reform. The
primary focus of these reforms was to introduce cost-containment measures and optimize governmental

24


-----

healthcare spending, particularly for prescription drugs, which account for the significant majority of our
sales. Measures implemented in line with these reforms are fragmented and vary by country. Certain
European countries have introduced numerous austerity measures to lower healthcare spending, including
mandatory discounts, clawbacks and price referencing rules. In certain cases, reimbursements for
high-priced drugs were refused. The United Kingdom and Germany, for example, introduced new systems
to determine cost effectiveness of drugs, which will decide the reimbursement level for a drug. In Spain the
government’s pricing and reimbursement policy is focused on cost-containment measures as they attempt
to reduce the financial deficit, which has repeatedly resulted in price cuts, reductions to wholesale and
retail margins and cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs since 2000; we believe the pace at which these
regulatory measures are enacted has accelerated in recent years. The Spanish government has also enacted
four royal decree-laws since 2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical industry by means of price
reduction of older pharmaceutical products, mandatory rebates on drugs, and limitations for the numbers
of products eligible for a reimbursement under the Spanish National Health Service. Furthermore, the
National Health Service in the United Kingdom and the Italian National Health Service have also
introduced mandatory rebates affecting all of our products. The Russian government has released a list of
vital and essential pharmaceuticals (‘‘VEP’’) which are subject to mandatory price caps. Overpricing can
result in fines and other penalties. Certain countries also cut their healthcare expenditure budgets or fixed
them at a particular amount. Furthermore, mandatory price cuts were introduced in respect of off-patent,
generic and patented drugs, including for Dilatrend� in Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Belgium and Russia
and Cymevene� in Turkey and Colombia.

Any such cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for the pharmaceutical products
that we currently distribute or we may acquire in the future. As a result, it may no longer be economical to
market certain or all of our products in a country. The governments of the countries where we operate
may, in the future, implement further regulations that impose additional pressure on the price of
pharmaceutical products.

Any of the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and changes in these regulations, or failure by us or any of our_**
**_third party manufacturers or distributors to comply with regulations, could harm our business._**

We and the third-party manufacturers and distributors on which we rely are subject to extensive, complex,
costly and evolving regulations. These regulations govern, among other things, the development,
authorization, procurement of contract manufacturing, wholesale distribution and supply,
pharmacovigilance and promotion of our products. See ‘‘Regulation’’. While the regulations in the
European Union are to a certain extent harmonized, the regulatory environment outside the European
Union is fragmented and varies by country. Globally, we market our products in over 120 countries, across
Europe, Asia and Oceania, South America, North America and Africa, and each of these countries may
regulate these areas differently.

We sell pharmaceutical products which are predominantly comprised of prescription products. In most
countries, the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly (for example through statutory
price reductions) or indirectly (for example through reference prices and reimbursement rates payable by
the health insurance system, mandatory discounts, terms and/or requirements concerning discounts, the
creation of framework conditions to stimulate market forces and competition). Pricing also may be
influenced by supranational regulations in the European Union. Any changes in these regulations or
procedural rules, such as those governing public procurement and tender processes, could reduce the
profitability of individual products and, in exceptional cases, could render a product unprofitable.
See ‘‘—Existing and future healthcare cost-containment reform measures by government health authorities or
_government-sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect our business’’._

The regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions where we operate rigorously monitor and enforce compliance
with the relevant regulations by pharmaceutical companies, and our operations and the operations of the
third-party manufacturers and distributors on whom we rely, are subject to periodic inspections by the
relevant regulatory authorities in our markets. The manufacturers of our pharmaceutical products are, for
example, subject to principles of good manufacturing practices (‘‘GMP’’) and good distribution practice
(‘‘GDP’’), and compliance with these principles is assessed by the competent regulators via site audits. See
‘‘Regulation—Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing’’ and ‘‘Regulation—Distribution’’. Following these
inspections, the relevant regulator may issue notices listing the conditions that inspectors believe may

25


-----

violate GMP, GDP or other applicable regulations, and warning letters that could modify certain activities
identified during the inspection. While we have outsourced the manufacture and distribution of our
products to third parties, we remain fully responsible for the quality and regulatory compliance of our
products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance
expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution,
suspension of the review of our product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal
prosecution, as well as reputational harm, reduced sales and market share. If any of these risks materialize,
our supply could be disrupted and our sales could be materially and adversely affected and we could be
required to pay penalties imposed by German, EU or other competent authorities. As a result of
impurities or other production defects, we have in the past recalled specific batches of certain of our
products as a precautionary measure to address potential risks to patients and expect such recalls to
continue to occur from time to time in the future. None of these recalls resulted in sanctions being
imposed by competent authorities. In addition, in 2019, the Spanish health authority (AEMPS) imposed a
fine of approximately A200,000 on us for not reporting a stock-out for the product Konakion� in a timely
manner. While we believe that we are taking adequate measures to mitigate the regulatory risk, there is no
assurance that, should regulatory scrutiny further increase, they will continue to be effective.

In addition, continuing compliance with increased regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase our costs. For
example, since February 2019 manufacturers and distributors of pharmaceutical products in the European
Union are required to comply with new standards in relation to the packaging of such products which are
aimed to reduce the risk of counterfeit products. Among other things, these new regulations require the
packaging to be ‘‘tamper safe’’ which reduces the speed at which the products can be packaged. Several
other countries, such as Russia, are in the process of or planning to introduce similar measures. These
third parties are subject to similar regulatory compliance. If any of those third parties does not comply with
our regulatory requirements, we could be adversely affected if their non-compliance results in an
interruption in our supply of our products or, in the case of any of our licensors, it hinders our ability to
produce our in-licensed products.

Any failure by us or any of those third-parties or licensors to comply with governmental regulations, or any
regulatory action taken against us or any of those third parties or licensors, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_We commercialize our products through marketing authorizations and the loss of, or inability to maintain or_**
**_acquire, such marketing authorizations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our business is marketing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. We require a marketing
authorization for a product in each country in which we are planning to distribute a product and must
procure that the marketing authorizations for newly acquired products are transferred to us from the
seller. The process for transferring marketing authorizations can be time consuming and requires
significant resources. For each marketing authorization in a country, the buyer or the seller (depending on
local regulations) has to submit an application or notification to the competent authority to request the
transfer of the marketing authorization. This application also contains the submission of various
supporting documents (e.g., a transfer agreement between the old and new holder of the marketing
authorization, updated product texts, updated artworks, proof of payment for relevant fees, wholesaler
license, proof of establishment or GMP-certificates) for review by the competent authority. The length of
the review process can vary between one day (e.g. Germany) and more than one year (e.g., Vietnam,
Ukraine). In addition, the transfer of a marketing authorization can be delayed due to other factors
beyond our controls such as capacity constraints in providing required documents by the selling
pharmaceutical company. A delay in the process of transferring a marketing authorization can negatively
affect our transition plan for a newly acquired product and may have follow-on effects on areas such as our
ability to outsource the production to the CMO chosen by us or the packaging of the product. A delay may
also lead to a situation in which a product is temporarily out of stock if the pharmaceutical company from
which we have acquired the product has already ceased manufacture of a product and the bridging stock is
depleted as a result of a longer than expected transfer process.

As of September 30, 2019, we held approximately 619 different marketing authorizations. We are currently
awaiting approval of an additional 103 marketing authorizations, and expect approximately 340 marketing
authorizations by the end of 2020. In addition, in many jurisdictions we are required to renew marketing
authorizations periodically. Failure to obtain marketing authorizations for new products as needed or

26


-----

maintain and renew our existing marketing authorizations as needed could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the
Notes. See ‘‘Regulation’’ and ‘‘—We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and changes in these
_regulations, or failure by us or any of our third party manufacturers or distributors to comply with regulations,_
_could harm our business’’._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Products**

**_We face risks associated with our strategy of acquiring new products._**

Our growth strategy is dependent on our continued ability to acquire new products or product portfolios.
In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 we agreed acquisitions of three, five and nine
products, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we agreed the acquisition of an additional 14
products (twelve thereof through two portfolio acquisitions from Sanofi).

The success of our strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct
appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on terms that are favorable for us and complete such
transactions. Our objective of acquiring further products in the future depends on the existence of suitable
acquisition targets and our ability to finance their acquisition which are in turn dependent on a number of
factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following:

- the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to sell legacy or niche products;

- our reputation as a reliable partner for pharmaceutical companies;

- the level of competition for the acquisition of such products and higher prices for such products that
may result from increased competition; and

- our ability to raise the funds required for such acquisitions either in the private or public market.

In particular, since January 1, 2016, we have entered into agreements for the acquisition of 31 different
products from seven different pharmaceutical companies. During the same period, the significant majority
of our product acquisitions has been from Roche. If our reputation as a reliable partner for any of these
large pharmaceutical companies were to be negatively affected, for example as a result of our failure to
close an agreed acquisition or other reasons, our ability to acquire further products may be impaired.

Our competitors, such as Atnahs Pharma UK Limited, Recordati S.p.A., Zentiva Group, a.s., Theo
Pharma PVT LTD and Riemser Pharma AG, are following similar acquisition strategies to ours. In
addition, new competitors may choose to enter the market in which we are active and such competitors
may have greater financial resources than us or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can
accept, which may prevent us from acquiring the products that we target and reduce the number of
potential acquisition targets.

If we complete acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all the customers and
patients, generate expected margins or cash flows, or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions,
including expected performance improvements or cost savings. Although we analyze acquisition targets on
an ongoing basis, those assessments are subject to several assumptions concerning profitability, future
development of sales, interest rates, return on investment and the potential for cost savings. There can be
no assurance that our assessments and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct,
and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. The products we acquire are often
characterized by a declining revenue profile and we may underestimate the degree or pace of future
revenue decline due to factors including, without limitation, lower sales prices, competition from generic
product or product substitution. For example, the products Seroquel� and Seroquel XR�, which we
recently acquired, experienced significant declines in sale during the years preceding the acquisition, partly
due to a second generation of generics entering the market. According to IMS, between 2015 and 2018
sales of Seroquel� and Seroquel XR� declined at a CAGR of 28.0% and 55.9% in Europe and the United
States and Canada, respectively and we expect such decline to continue. Also, patent protection for
Seroquel XR� only expired in 2017, and therefore competition from generic products has not settled to the
same extent as for other, more mature products in our portfolio. Furthermore, Xenical, which we acquired
in 2017, has generated lower than expected sales due to various unconnected reasons, including temporary
stock-outs in the U.S. and China and lower sales in Australia, which previously served as a platform for
sales into China.

27


-----

Moreover, the products we acquire may be subject to risks or problems which we may not be aware of,
which we may not detect or which have not been disclosed to us in the due diligence process. We may learn
about such risks or problems only after consummation of the acquisitions, in particular with respect to
unknown side effects and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to
successfully identify and assess risks related to acquisitions, we may be exposed to legal, market or other
risks related to the products that we acquire, which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_We may be unable to integrate new products into our manufacturing, distribution and sales processes in a timely and_**
**_cost-efficient manner or at all._**

Our ability to implement our growth strategy depends on our ability to successfully integrate the new
products that we acquire. Integration of an acquired product is a complex and costly process that can take
up to three years or, in certain cases, even longer and involves cumbersome regulatory processes as well as
integrating a new product into our manufacturing, distribution and sales processes. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to integrate newly acquired products in a timely and cost-efficient manner or
at all. For example, in 2019, we experienced a delay in the approval of our new Konakion� packaging
following the transfer of the marketing authorization from Sanofi, which led to a stock-out.

A significant factor determining the complexity of the integration process is the number of marketing
authorizations which have to be transferred to us, which is in turn determined by the number of
jurisdictions in which a product is sold. Each marketing authorization related to a newly acquired product
must be transferred to us under the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to it before we can commercialize a
new product in our own name. Depending on the jurisdiction, the process of transferring a market
authorization can take up to three years or even longer and requires significant knowledge and resources
and there can be no guarantee that we are successful in transferring each relevant marketing authorization.

In addition, we typically do not acquire or assume the seller’s existing manufacturing, distribution or sales
organizations or contracts when acquiring a new product. Accordingly, we have to enter into
manufacturing agreements with one or more CMOs as well as logistics and distribution agreement with
third-party service providers. We also must integrate a new product into our quality control and
pharmacovigilance systems to be able to comply with regulatory requirements. All of these steps require
significant resources, are prone to delays and may entail significant upfront costs which we may not recover
if the integration of a new product is not successful. We may for example encounter difficulties to secure
sufficient production capacity from CMOs (in particular to produce the additional bridging stock which is
required to avoid a stock-out during the transfer phase), source the API for a newly acquired product or
lose access to manufacturing know-how.

Generally, when we acquire new products we identify potential cost savings that are expected to be realized
once the new product is fully integrated into our processes. The success of these measures is particularly
important to us because our products are often characterized by a declining revenue profile. Achieving cost
savings and the process of integrating new products into our business involves risks. In addition to those
mentioned above, these risks include the following:

- diversion of management’s time and attention from daily operations to the integration of the new
products;

- retaining the loyalty of existing customers, patients, physicians and other relevant third parties;

- unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual or other issues;

- unforeseen negative side effects; and

- difficulties in maintaining the timeliness and quality of manufacture and distribution.

Moreover, even if we are able to successfully integrate new products, we may not be able to realize the
potential cost savings, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we expect, and the costs of
achieving these benefits may be higher, and the timing may differ from, what we expect. Our ability to
realize cost saving may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:

- the use of more cash or other financial resources on the integration process than we expect;

- our ability to lower costs through contract manufacturing agreements and other agreements with
third-party service providers at favorable terms; and

- an increase in other expenses unrelated to the acquisitions which may offset the cost savings from the
acquisition.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in the
anticipated timeframe or at all. Any failure by us to integrate newly acquired products could, individually
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and on
our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We may not be able to manage our growth efficiently._**

We have experienced significant growth in the past, increasing the number of products from approximately
60 as of December 31, 2016 to more than 80 as of September 30, 2019 and expanding our workforce from
116 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2016 to 304 full-time equivalent employees as of
September 30, 2019. If we succeed with our strategy to further grow our business, we will be required to
further expand, in particular our distribution, regulatory, pharmacovigilance and quality control functions
and to continue to invest in related information technology systems which we may not achieve in a timely
and cost-efficient manner or at all. For example, we were unable to assume the pharmacovigilance
activities for one of our newly acquired products as of the expected transition time point because our
existing database cannot handle the volume of historic reports and real-time reports. As a result, we may
be required to replace our existing database. In addition, we would need to pay the seller an annual fee for
their temporary pharmacovigilance service for the product on our behalf.

Our historic growth has placed significant demands on our management and key employees as the
expansion increased the complexity of our business and placed a significant strain on our management,
operations, technical systems and internal reporting and any future growth may further amplify these
demands and strains. Our current and planned personnel, systems, processes and controls may not be
adequate to support and effectively manage our operations. Our ability to hire a sufficient number of new
employees for our operations depends on the overall availability of qualified employees mainly in
Greifswald, Germany, where our headquarters is located and our ability to offer them sufficiently
attractive employment terms compared to other employers. See ‘‘—We may be unable to recruit and retain
_key personnel, including qualified scientific, technical and sales employees’’._

Our growth in recent years has driven significant increases in our overhead costs, as well as interest
expense. If we experience significant future growth, we may be required not only to make additional
investments and further expand our workforce, but also to expand our relationship with CMOs, logistics
providers and other third party providers with whom we do business and to expend time and effort to
integrate these service providers into our processes.

Any failure to effectively manage our growth could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_We rely on third parties to manufacture and distribute our products, which increases the risk that we will not have_**
**_sufficient quantities of our products available at an acceptable cost or quality, on time or at all._**

We strive to deliver high quality pharmaceutical products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective
manner. The manufacture and distribution of our products is highly exacting and complex due, in part, to
strict regulatory requirements governing their manufacture. We outsource all manufacturing, packaging,
storage and distribution of our products to third parties, over whom we have no or very limited control. We
do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for the commercial production of our
products. We have limited personnel with experience in pharmaceutical manufacturing and we lack the
resources and the capabilities to manufacture any pharmaceutical products.

Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in
scaling up initial production and in maintaining required quality control. These problems include
difficulties with production costs and yields and quality control, including stability of the product. For
example, we recently had to stop the planned transfer of a specific SKU for Aldactone� to a new CMO as
the CMO was unable to manufacture a product that met all required specifications. In addition, we have in
the past experienced supply constraints in relation to Deursil� due to shortages of raw materials as well as
various manufacturing issues at the site of our CMO for Deursil�. If our third-party manufacturers, or
other third parties, or other parties on whom these third parties rely, fail to perform their obligations in a
timely, cost-effective manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market could
be limited and our reputation and results of operations could suffer as a result. For example, during a
market upturn, our third-party manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which
may preclude us from fulfilling our distributors’ orders on a timely basis. Likewise, we could be materially

29


-----

disadvantaged if our products were not stored correctly or if they were not distributed in a proper, timely
fashion. Furthermore, the failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to maintain high manufacturing
standards could result in injury to or death of patients using our products. Such failure could also result in,
among other things, warning letters, sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, suspension or
withdrawal of marketing authorizations and other necessary approvals, delays or failures in delivery of our
products, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which
could seriously harm our reputation, business or profitability. See ‘‘—Product liability claims, contamination
_issues or product recalls involving our products could damage our brand and reputation among our customers_
_and patients’’._

In addition, we depend on the pharmaceutical companies from which we acquire new products for certain
services during a transition phase. Until the transfer of the marketing authorization for a newly acquired
product in a country is complete, we are not permitted to market or distribute such product in our own
name. We therefore enter into TSAs with the seller of a product pursuant to which the relevant
pharmaceutical company will distribute and market the product in its own name but on our account until
the transfer of the required marketing authorization is complete. A failure of the selling pharmaceutical
company to comply with its obligations under the TSA could for example result in lower sales or regulatory
sanctions which could in turn have a negative impact on our business. For example, when entering into a
TSA, we agree the amount of ‘bridging stock’ (i.e., the amount of inventory that the selling pharmaceutical
company must make available to meet demand during the transition phase). If demand is significantly
higher than foreseen or the transition phase until completion of the MAT takes significantly longer than
expected, this could lead to a stock-out situation in which the product is no longer available. In some cases,
the bridging stock is defined on a local level and we may be unable to use excess stock available in other
local markets if a stock-out situation occurs in another local market.

Our reliance on third-party manufacturers, distributors and, during a transition phase, the sellers from
whom we acquired a new product may disadvantage us in regards to certain products as compared to our
principle competitors, many of whom manufacture their own products. For example, certain competitors
that have control over their manufacturing operations may be able to provide a more reliable supply of
specific products to customers and avoid stock-outs, which pharmacies cite as one of the main causes
behind a decision to switch suppliers. Without such control over our supply chain, we may need to increase
our inventory in order to avoid shortages, resulting in a higher net working capital. As a result, our current
and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture and distribution of our products may
adversely affect our future results of operation or profitability.

**_We do not control the third parties on whom we rely for the manufacture, storage, distribution and marketing of our_**
**_products._**

The ability of our third-party contractors, including our CMOs, our distributors and our logistics providers,
to perform their obligations to us is largely outside of our control. Reliance on third-party manufacturers
entails risks to which we would not be exposed if we manufactured our products ourselves, including:

- inability of the third party to secure and maintain certain regulatory compliance and quality assurance;

- limitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of the third
parties;

- impact on our reputation in the marketplace if manufacturers of our products fail to meet the
demands of, or cause the injury to or death of, customers;

- the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our
control; and

- the possible termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business
priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.

For example, if one or more of our third-party contractors experiences a significant disruption in services
or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could
increase, the manufacture or delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed and our sales could be
adversely affected. If our manufacturing partners cannot successfully manufacture products that conform
to the strict requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities or if our manufacturing contractors are not
able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities, we could be negatively
impacted. If a regulatory authority does not approve a facility for the manufacture or storage of our

30


-----

products, or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing
or storage facilities. In such situations, changing or replacing our third-party manufacturers could cause
disruptions or delays and we may be limited in our ability to do so quickly enough or at all.

In addition, if our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations or if they provide us
with products that are defective or contain contaminated substances that were not identified before
distribution to customers or patients, we could face sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties,
suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorizations and other necessary approvals, delays, or failures in
delivery of our products, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions,
any of which could seriously harm our reputation, business or profitability. Because we also outsource the
storage and distribution of our products, we may not discover defects or contaminations in our products in
time to prevent potential harm to patients or discover such defects or contaminations at all, which could
have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
Additionally, we may be forced to recall products from the market. This may, in certain cases, lead to
product liability claims and significant costs, as well as reputational harm. See ‘‘—Product liability claims,
_contamination issues or product recalls involving our products could damage our brand and reputation among_
_our customers and patients’’._

**_Failure to obtain or renew agreements with third parties on acceptable terms or the termination of such agreements_**
**_by our material contractors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We have a large number of agreements and relationships with third parties, including various
manufacturers, logistics providers and other contractors, many of which are our sole source of supply for a
specific ingredient, material or service. For example, we source vitamin K1, the API for our product
Konakion�, from a single supplier. In addition, we typically rely on a single distributor in each country in
which we market our products, and in certain cases a single distributor is responsible for several countries.
Although we believe that our business is not materially dependent on any single third party, failure to
obtain or renew contracts with material third parties as needed could negatively impact our business. If we
lose a third-party manufacturer, we may not be able to engage an alternative third party in time to prevent
delays in the production or distribution of our products. For example, replacing the supplier of the active
pharmaceutical ingredient for our products may take up to three years due to strict regulatory
requirements. Additionally, in the future, we may be unable to enter into agreements with third-party
manufacturers or distributors, as well as the other third parties on whom we rely for the distribution and
sale of our products, or we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. Our ability to obtain or renew
contracts with material third parties may be limited by circumstances outside of our control, such as
general economic decline, market saturation or increased competition. Although we have been able to
negotiate favorable terms with our third-party contractors in the past, we cannot guarantee that we will be
able to successfully renegotiate those contracts as needed or secure terms that are as favorable to us.

**_We are exposed to significant default and counterparty risks in connection with operating our business and as a_**
**_result of contracting parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations._**

We are exposed to default and counterparty risks in connection with our third-party contractors, the
pharmaceutical companies with whom we entered into TSAs if contracting parties fail to meet their
obligations. In addition, there is the risk that, in a deteriorating economic and financial environment,
customers may delay or fail to make payments to us or our business partners, thus generating or increasing
default and counterparty risks. A significant portion of our sales are derived from sales to a relatively
limited number of distributors. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our largest distributor
represented 8% of our total sales. For the same period, our ten largest distributors represented 28% of our
total sales. Although we believe that our business is not materially dependent on any single distributor, if
we were to experience a significant reduction in or loss of business with one or more distributors, or if one
or more distributor or TSA counterparty were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, our
financial condition, results of operations and our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes could
be materially adversely affected.

While we strive to maintain business relations with business partners of good financial standing and our
agreements with contractors generally include contractual remedies to safeguard us against default risk,
these measures may be insufficient. In addition, third parties on whom we rely may have inadequate
internal compliance resources. The failure of our third-party manufacturers and service providers to meet

31


-----

their contractual obligations could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations
and our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our ability to market our products successfully and the strength of our brand depends, in part, upon the acceptance_**
**_of the products not only by patients, but also by the public and private health insurers, pharmacists, physicians_**
**_depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate._**

Our ability to market our products successfully and the strength of our brand and reputation with
customers depends in large part on the acceptance of products by patients, as well as other third parties
including public and private health insurers, physicians, hospitals, local health units and other public
authorities depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate. We rely to a significant extent on the
strength of our brands and their reputation. Our most important brands include Atacand�, Dilatrend�,
Vesanoid� and Xenical�. Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of our
products or brands could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptance of our
products with any of these groups of persons. Acceptance of our products depends upon a wide variety of
factors, many of which are beyond our control and many of which are not correlated to the quality or
efficacy of our products. These factors include the following:

- perception of our products as effective, safe and optimal treatments;

- receptiveness of physicians and pharmacists to our products;

- perceived advantages and disadvantages of any given product relative to competing products,
treatments or therapies;

- prevalence, severity and nature of side effects;

- product recalls;

- availability of our products in sufficient quantities to satisfy customer demand and stock-out
situations;

- reimbursement levels set by third parties, such as health insurers; and

- prevalence of the disease for which a product is prescribed.

If any of our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by customers, patients or other
independent third parties, as discussed above, we may be unable to generate sufficient or any sales from
these products to make them profitable and this is likely to only be evident after significant cost has been
expended. If our products fail to gain and maintain significant market acceptance, there could be a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Product liability claims, contamination issues or product recalls involving our products could damage our brand_**
**_and reputation among customers and patients._**

Although we are engaged in the commercialization, but not the research and development, production or
manufacturing, of pharmaceutical products, and although the active ingredients in those products are
thoroughly vetted and often have been in the market for ten or more years, there is a risk that we may be
liable for, or incur costs related to, liability claims if any of our products cause injury or are found to be
unsuitable for patient use. This risk exists even with respect to products that have received, or may receive
in the future, regulatory approval for commercial use. In some instances, adverse reactions to medicinal
products may become apparent only years after market introduction.

Our products could also be defective or contain contaminated substances that were not identified during
our manufacturers’ production process, and adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these
products could occur. Product liability lawsuits are often costly to defend and can result in substantial
monetary awards to customers, and, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, can result in reduced sales,
harm to our brand and reputation, the inability to commercialize our products and diversion of
management’s time, attention and resources. Considerable sums in damages have been awarded against
pharmaceutical companies due to physical harm allegedly caused by the use of certain products.
Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims could result in negative publicity, decreased
demand for our products and damage to our reputation and require us to incur significant legal fees.
Product liability claims may also force us to withdraw some of our products from the market, thus creating
potential for further claims. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are not involved in any
material product liability litigation. However, some of our products are the subject of product liability

32


-----

litigation in markets in which we have either not acquired the marketing authorization to distribute such
product or in relation to the time period prior to us acquiring the product. In relation to Losec�, numerous
product liability claims against AstraZeneca pending in the United States and Canada alleging that the use
of Losec� causes kidney failure. While we are not a defendant in such litigation as AstraZeneca holds the
marketing authorizations for Losec� in the United States, there can be no assurance that similar claims
may be raised in the future in other jurisdictions in which we have acquired the marketing authorizations
for Losec�. This risk is likely to increase should the litigation in the United States or Canada be successful.
In addition, in 2018, we acquired Lariam�, a product used to prevent malaria. There are currently multiple
lawsuits pending, including mass tort actions, alleging that Lariam� caused neurological and psychiatric
side effects such as depression and suicidal tendencies. While the defendants in these lawsuits are primarily
governmental agencies and armed forces of several countries, including Canada, Ireland, the United
Kingdom and the United States, due to the fact that Lariam� was frequently used by military personnel on
deployment in areas affected by malaria, there are also lawsuits pending against Roche as the previous
owner of the marketing authorization for Lariam�.

In addition, we also market and distribute Rohypnol�, a drug used for the treatment of sleeping problems.
Rohypnol� has been associated with substance abuse as well as drug-facilitated sexual assault and is a
controlled drug in many jurisdictions. In the United States, it is considered an illegal drug and not
approved. Negative publicity in connection with, or any investigation in, the abuse of Rohypnol� may
negatively affect our ability to continue to commercialize Rohypnol� or our reputation.

While we have in the past recalled specific batches of certain of our products due to impurities or other
production defects and as a precautionary measure to address potential risks to patients, and expect such
recalls to continue to occur from time to time in the future, none of these recalls resulted in sanctions
being imposed by competent authorities. However, we may be unable to successfully defend ourselves in
product liability claims in the future. We carry insurance coverage for product liability claims. See
‘‘Business—Insurance’’. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all or even a material part
of any significant product liability claim. Furthermore, at any time, insurance coverage may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to guard against product liability
claims, contamination, product recalls or other quality control issues, we could experience a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_Our products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could limit their commercial potential._**

Undesirable side effects caused by any of our products could require us to initiate product recalls or result
in the revocation of regulatory approvals of such product, which could in turn lead to potential product
liability claims, reduced patient demand, lower rates of prescription of our products by physicians and
reluctance by pharmacists to dispense our products. See ‘‘—Product liability claims, contamination issues or
_product recalls involving our products could damage our brand and reputation among customers and patients’’._
Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining the commercial success of our
products, could substantially increase our commercialization costs and, in general, could have a material
adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_Counterfeit versions of our products could harm patients and our reputation._**

The pharmaceutical industry is vulnerable to counterfeiting of pharmaceutical products and the increasing
availability of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet. For example, we
have recently received a report concerning a counterfeit version of one of our products from a customer in
Indonesia. While this incident did not result in any patient safety issue, counterfeit products are frequently
unsafe or ineffective and can potentially be life-threatening. To distributors and patients, counterfeit
products may be indistinguishable from the authentic product. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit
pharmaceutical products or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in
the authentic product and harm our reputation and business and lead to litigation. In addition, it is
possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products could mistakenly be attributed to the
authentic product. If one or more of our products continue to be the subject of counterfeits in the future,
we could incur substantial reputational and financial harm, which could in turn have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to perform our obligations under the
Notes.

33


-----

**_Any significant increase in the cost of active ingredients or auxiliary materials used in manufacturing our products_**
**_or their availability could adversely affect our profit margins and operating results._**

Affordable, high-quality active ingredients and auxiliary materials are essential to our business due to the
nature of the products we sell. Even though we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, the
CMOs regularly have a right to pass on price increases for ingredients or materials to us under the relevant
manufacturing agreements. In other cases, we are directly responsible for supplying the CMO with the
ingredients and materials required for the manufacture of our products and our contracts with suppliers
often provide for the supplier’s right to increase prices annually. In addition, rationing or shortages, as well
as fluctuations in the price of the ingredients or materials required for the manufacture of our products
can occur and our third-party manufacturers may pass these costs onto us or distribution of our products
may be delayed or made impossible due to price changes or shortages of such ingredients and materials. In
some cases, we try to manage these risks through mechanisms aimed at reducing our financial exposure,
such as pricing clauses that link procurement prices to current selling prices. However, there can be no
assurance that rapid cost increases or extended supply shortages of these ingredients and materials will not
occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our
ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We may be unable to recruit and retain key personnel, including skilled and qualified scientific, technical and sales_**
**_employees._**

We are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees, including our scientific, technical
and sales personnel. The loss of any senior manager or key employee may significantly delay or prevent the
achievement of our growth strategy, integration efforts or business objectives. Due to the specialized
scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain
qualified scientific, technical and sales personnel. Loss of the services of, or difficulties in recruiting, key
management, scientific, technical or sales personnel could be materially detrimental to our business and
financial condition. We face competition for scientific and technical personnel from other companies,
academic institutions, government entities and other organization. Such competition is also enhanced by a
Germany-wide shortage of qualified professionals, such as scientific or technical personnel. In addition,
increasing demand for higher wages may make it difficult for us to hire or retain the necessary personnel.

The loss of any key personnel or the inability to attract, recruit and retain highly skilled employees
required for our activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Industrial action or adverse labor relations could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our operating_**
**_results_**

If we are unable to maintain satisfactory employee relations or negotiate acceptable labor agreements in
future, the results could include work stoppages, strikes or other industrial action or labor difficulties
(including higher labor costs). This risk may increase in the future if we were to become obliged to
establish an advisory board with employee representative as a result of continued growth in the number of
our employees.

While we believe that we have good relations with employees generally, there can be no assurance that our
relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the future. Any of these
adverse labor situations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_A breakdown in our information technology systems could result in a significant disruption of our business._**

Our operations are highly dependent on our information technology systems. We make continuous
investments to appropriately adapt these complex systems to changing business processes. Such systems are
vulnerable to a number of problems, such as software or hardware malfunctions, human error, intentional
or unintentional improper handling, malicious hacking, physical damage to vital data centers and computer
virus infection. In addition, the information technology system needs regular upgrading to accommodate
expansion of our business and maintain the efficiency of our operations. If we face a breakdown in our
system, we could experience significant business and operational delays across our businesses. In
particular, any breakdown in our information technology systems could result in disruptions of our
procurement, sales, customer contact, accounting and billing processes. We also rely on the availability of
our information technology systems to fulfil our regulatory obligations with respect to the reporting of

34


-----

adverse side effects to the competent health authorities. To the extent that any disruption or security
breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or
proprietary information, we could incur liability. Any of this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the
Notes.

**_We handle personal data including, to a minor extent, sensitive patient data in the ordinary course of our business,_**
**_and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of that data could result in legal liability for us and reputational_**
**_harm to our business._**

From time to time, and generally in connection with our pharmacovigilance activities, we process sensitive
personal patient data (including, in certain instances, names, addresses and health data) as part of our
business, and therefore we must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws. For example, we are
subject to extensive European laws and regulations on privacy, information security and data protection,
the main and most relevant of which relate to the collection, protection and use of personal and business
data, including the EU Regulation 2016/679 (‘‘GDPR’’). In particular, we adapted our internal procedures
to the requirements imposed by the recently implemented GDPR. The costs of complying with the GDPR
are increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer
mechanisms are in place. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws,
such as GDPR, could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or
actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation. See ‘‘Regulation—Data Protection’’.

Moreover, data protection laws and rules impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our
ability to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers, and could
make us liable in the event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third party access.
Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber security breaches as a result of human error,
external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches, and
physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access.

We, our distributors, suppliers and other business partners may be the subject to breaches of security by
hackers. A future breach of our system or that of one of our distributors, suppliers or other business
partners may subject us to material losses or liability, including fines, claims for unauthorized use of
personal and sensitive data or other claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity breach could harm
our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to
uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, result in the imposition of
material penalties and fines under any applicable international laws or regulations.

If a single material breach or series of less material breaches was to occur, we could face liability under
data protection laws, could lose the goodwill of our clients and could have our reputation damaged, all of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to risks associated with cross border sales and purchases._**

We market our products in more than 120 countries globally. Due to differing regulatory regimes, certain
of our products may be classified differently in some jurisdictions. Different classifications could also result
in pricing differences, which may be material. Cross border operations are subject to risks, including but
not limited to:

- inadequate protection of intellectual property and unregistered know how;

- difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign
laws, regulations and treaties, some of which are subject to change;

- legal uncertainties regarding, and timing delays associated with, customs procedures, tariffs, import or
export licensing requirements and other trade barriers;

- legal and practical obstacles in efficiently enforcing contractual rights;

- differing local product preferences and product requirements;

- increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts;

- risk of loss at sea or other delays in the delivery of products caused by transportation problems;

35


-----

- differing tax regimes; and

- economic sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods.

Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in many different countries._**

We develop, market a broad range of pharmaceutical products which are available in more than 120
countries, including Italy, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States,
China, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Australia and the MENA region.
Both of our operations and those of our local sales and business partners in these countries may be subject
to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions;
expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict;
bribery and corruption; national and regional labor strikes; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax
policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of
products; anti-trust risks; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the repatriation
of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the effect of
global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions, market opportunities and operating
restrictions; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit. In addition, we or any of our local
business partners may be subject to legal proceedings regarding bribery and corruption in these countries,
and we are unable to ensure or monitor the lawful conduct of our business partners’ operations. These
factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_Fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

We market our products in more than 120 countries and, accordingly, a significant portion of our sales are
in currencies other than the euro, our reporting currency, which gives rise to translation risks. As our
operations are concentrated in Germany and most of our manufacturing agreements, which represent a
significant portion of our costs, are with European CMOs, our results are subject to foreign exchange
transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate risks relate to the exchange rate of the euro to the
U.S. dollar and of the euro to the Swiss franc.

Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our
and their respective functional currency. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but generate
sales in another, any change in the values of those currencies could cause our profits to decrease or our
products to be less competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and receivables that
are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are greater or less than our
liabilities denominated in a different currency, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations and
movements in the foreign exchange markets. Where we are unable to match sales and receivables
denominated in foreign currencies with expenses and liabilities denominated in the same currency, our
results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.

We currently hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange risks associated with anticipated future cash
flows denominated in foreign currency. Although we plan to enter into additional hedging agreements in
the future, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. In addition, if we were to use any hedging transactions in the future in the
form of derivative financial instruments, such transactions may result in mark-to-market losses. Such
financial instruments could also not be sufficient or not effective and expose us to a default risk of the
relevant counterparty.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition,
results of operations and our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our business is subject to other operating risks, including natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, terrorism and_**
**_other criminal activities._**

Our operations are subject to risks normally incidental to manufacturing operations which may result in
work stoppages and/or damage to property. These risks include unexpected disruptions in infrastructure,
strikes, accidents, natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, criminal activities and terrorism. While we
protect ourselves against such risks to the extent possible and financially reasonable through appropriate

36


-----

insurance policies, it cannot be excluded that this protection will not be sufficient and that any of these
events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and on our
ability to perform our obligations under the New Senior Notes.

**_We may not be adequately insured._**

We currently have insurance arrangements in place for product and public liability, property damage and
business interruption (including sudden and unexpected environmental damage). These insurance policies
may not, however, cover any losses or damages resulting from the materialization of any of the risks we are
subject to. Further, significant increases in insurance premiums could reduce our cash flow. It is also
possible that in the future insurance providers may no longer wish to insure businesses in our industry
against certain risks, e.g. in connection with product liabilities. Any such event could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**Risks Related to Laws, Regulation and Taxation**

**_Non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or environmental, health and safety litigation or_**
**_liability could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition._**

We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CMOs, for the manufacturing
and supply of our products. These third parties are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, transportation,
use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Although we have auditing rights
with all of our manufacturers, we do not have control over any third-party provider’s compliance with
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Liabilities they incur pursuant to these laws and
regulations could result in significant costs to them, which they may pass to us, or in certain circumstances,
an interruption in our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition
if we are unable to find an alternate manufacturer in a timely manner. We also could incur significant costs
associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with applicable environmental,
health and safety laws. Although we maintain standard insurance relating to such risks, this insurance may
not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. See ‘‘—Risks Related to our Business and
_Products—We may not be adequately insured’’. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to_
comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or
future laws and regulations may impair our ability to operate and to implement our business strategy.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in substantial fines, penalties, other
sanctions or harm to our reputation which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our existing compliance structure may not be sufficient and non-compliance with laws and regulations may_**
**_adversely affect our business._**

Although we are in the process of establishing a compliance structure and policies and internal monitoring
systems aimed at, among other things, preventing direct or indirect acts of corruption, bribery,
anti-competitive behavior, money laundering, breaches of economic sanctions, fraud, environmental
crimes and any other illegal or otherwise unethical conducts, we may be unable to detect or prevent every
instance of such conducts involving our senior management, employees, consultants, partners, agents and
third-party representatives and intermediaries. In addition, our monitoring systems (including our internal
controls and procedures, policies and our risk management system) may not be sufficient to prevent, detect
and identify inadequate practices, and violation of law by such individuals, especially given our profile, size
as well as in light of the extent of our cooperation with them.

Any of the foregoing circumstances may expose us to civil and administrative penalties, as well as to
reputational damage which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from_**
**_manufacturing and distributing our products._**

There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry with respect to the manufacture, use
and sale of pharmaceutical products. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or
proprietary rights of third parties. Patent infringement claims are typical of our industry and while we only

37


-----

manufacture and distribute products that are no longer subject to patent protection, there can be no
assurance that an intellectual property infringement claim could not be brought against us and that we
would not be found to infringe on the commercial property rights of others.

We may be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing, selling or
using some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
infringement. Furthermore, a significant third-party claim could result in management’s attention being
distracted from current operations. The outcome of intellectual property related proceedings could
adversely affect, hinder, delay or prevent the manufacture, use, marketing or sale of our products or
processes. We may also be required to pay substantial damages or change our product offerings or expend
significant resources to develop non-infringing products or processes. We do not currently have insurance
coverage specifically for intellectual property related proceedings. Any of the above could affect our ability
to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Our business depends on intellectual property and the ability to protect such intellectual property against_**
**_infringements from third parties._**

Protecting our intellectual property is important to our business. Our most important intellectual property
are the trademarks related to our products, in particular Atacand�, Dilatrend�, Vesanoid� and Xenical�.
Our future success will depend on our ability to obtain brands and trademarks and protect such intellectual
property as well as our unregistered trade secrets against infringements by third parties. However, there
can be no assurance that any of our brands, processes or products can be adequately protected through
intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we may not have the resources to protect our intellectual
property against infringements by third parties (e.g., due to a lack of evidence or the cost of proceedings)
and such protection may not be effective in all cases. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual
property competitors may utilize brands similar to those under which we market our products.

We also seek to protect our trade secrets, unregistered proprietary know-how and processes through
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with suppliers, CMOs, employees, consultants and other
third parties. If these agreements are breached we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches.
Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of such
confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, confidential information may otherwise become known to our
competitors.

The realization of any of the above risks could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to the risk of litigation and other claims._**

While we are currently not party to any material litigation, such as product liability claims, warranty
obligations claims, alleged violations of trade confidentiality and others, there can be no assurance that we
will not become in such litigation matters in the future. See also ‘‘Risks Related to Our Business and
_Products—Product liability claims, contamination issues or product recalls involving our products could_
_damage our brand and reputation among customers and patients’’ and ‘‘—Third parties may claim that we_
_infringe their proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from manufacturing and distributing our_
_products’’. When we determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we will have to_
record provisions in an amount equal to our estimated liability. There can be also no assurance that such
provisions, if made in the future, will be sufficient to cover our actual litigation costs. In addition, thirdparty litigation, including litigation related to competition law, anti-trust law, tax law, patent law and to the
implementation of individual regulatory requirements in the provision of healthcare at a national or
supranational level, could have an indirect, materially adverse impact on us and the market environment in
which we operate.

In the ordinary course of our business we are from time to time involved in legal and arbitration
proceedings and could become involved in additional legal and arbitration proceedings in the future.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation
claims or similar matters under various laws or that product-specific provisions will be sufficient to cover
litigation costs. Moreover, it may be difficult for us to obtain and enforce claims related to existing
litigation under the laws of certain countries in which we operate at affordable costs and without any
materially adverse effects on our business in such country.

38


-----

Any of these events could result in considerable costs, including damages, legal fees and temporary or
permanent ban on the marketing of certain products and this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under
the Notes.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect_**
**_our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments.
We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We cannot be
certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax
positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to
pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect
such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows and on our ability to perform our obligations under
the Notes.

**_Pending and future tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional tax_**
**_liabilities._**

Our business activity is assessed for tax purposes based on currently applicable tax legislation taking into
account current case law and administrative interpretations. However, there may be uncertainties
regarding the tax treatment of specific transactions and we may contest taxes assessed against us. As a
result, there can be no assurance that the our current and future position on taxation matters will be
accepted by the relevant tax authorities. Such uncertainties in the applicable tax legislation or case law, as
well as any changes in interpretation by the tax authorities, could have a material adverse effect on the our
net assets, financial condition and results of operations.

We are regularly subject to tax audits. For example, the German tax authority recently concluded a tax
audit for the fiscal years 2013 to 2016 which we expect will result in additional tax obligations. We estimate
these obligations to amount to approximately A4 million plus accrued interest and expect to receive a
corrected tax assessment notice in 2020. While we believe that we have paid all material tax liabilities and
filed all material tax returns as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and made provisions that we
believe to be adequate with respect to material tax risks resulting from current or past tax audits, there can
be no assurance that tax deficiencies will not be asserted against us or that the taxes assessed by the
competent authorities pursuant to such tax audits will not exceed such provisions. All of the tax
assessments issued for periods which were not yet finally audited may be subject to review.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our Adjusted EBITDA is presented for informational purposes only, and the actual results of operations and_**
**_respective EBITDA contributions attributable to the relevant Recently Acquired Products for periods prior to their_**
**_acquisition may differ materially._**

The Adjusted EBITDA information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 included in this
Offering Memorandum is illustrative and presented for informational purposes only. See ‘‘Summary
_Financial and Other Information—Summary Other Financial Data’’. This information does not represent_
the results the Recently Acquired Products would have achieved had each of the acquisitions occurred on
October 1, 2018. The calculations of Adjusted EBITDA for each of the Recently Acquired Products are
based on information provided by the seller of the relevant Recently Acquired Product, due diligence and
management estimates. The actual EBITDA contribution of each of the Recently Acquired Products will
be different from the respective Adjusted EBITDA contribution indicated due to, among other things, the
declining revenue profile of the Recently Acquired Products, which will result in lower EBITDA, and other
circumstances, including, in particular, the length of the TSA phase for the Recently Acquired Product. See
also ‘‘—Risks Related to Our Business and Products—We face risks associated with our strategy of acquiring
_new products’’. The Adjusted EBITDA information and the relevant EBITDA contributions have not been_
audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Therefore, the Adjusted EBITDA
information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and may not give an accurate or complete
picture of the results of operations attributable to the relevant Recently Acquired Products for periods
prior to their acquisition, may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements or the other

39


-----

financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making
an investment decision.

The amount of Adjusted EBITDA for each of the Recently Acquired Products is based on a number of
assumptions. These assumptions could prove to be inaccurate since they relate to factors over which we
have limited or, in some cases, no control or influence. Accordingly, such assumptions may change or may
not materialize at all. Should one or more of the assumptions underlying the amount of Adjusted EBITDA
for each of the Recently Acquired Products prove to be incorrect, the actual EBITDA contribution of each
of the Recently Acquired Products could differ materially from the amounts presented in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on them.

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantee._**

We are highly leveraged and will have significant debt service obligations. As of September 30, 2019, on a
_pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (including the use of proceeds therefrom), we would_
have had Financial Indebtedness of A1,480.0 million, including indebtedness under the Notes. See
‘‘Capitalization’’.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following consummation of the Transactions could have
important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

- making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
business and the competitive environment, the industry in which we operate and general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate as well our flexibility to maximize business
opportunities;

- exposing us to increases in interest rates with respect to our floating rate liabilities, such as our
financing costs under Senior Facilities Agreement;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are
not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make_**
**_it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

The terms of the Indenture will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial
additional indebtedness, including in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility or other credit facilities in an
aggregate amount of at least A400 million, additional Notes by the Issuer and certain other indebtedness
permitted under the Indenture. The new debt that we may incur in the future, including, for example, in
connection with acquisitions, may rank _pari passu with, be structurally senior to, or be secured by assets_
that do not form part of the Collateral for, the Notes and the Guarantee. If any of our subsidiaries incurs
additional debt or if we incur debt that is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes, the holders of
that debt will be entitled to share ahead of the noteholders in any proceeds distributed in connection with
any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of such non-guarantor
subsidiary or in any proceeds from any enforcement of the security created over such collateral. Any
additional indebtedness could also mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture will contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement and

40


-----

the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under
those agreements. Furthermore, if we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries under the
Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow
beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted
subsidiaries may not engage. See ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and _‘‘Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement’’. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt_
levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs_**
**_and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture and the terms and conditions governing our other financing arrangements, including the
Senior Facilities Agreement, contain or will contain covenants which may impose significant restrictions on
the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

- make certain loans or investments;

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions and certain payments on
subordinated indebtedness, as well as certain investments;

- agree to limitations on the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
distributions;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- consolidate or merge with other entities; and

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes’’. Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we are subject could limit our_
ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities
and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement.
Any future financing agreements that we enter into may have covenants that are even more restrictive. The
requirement that we comply with these and any future provisions may materially adversely affect our ability
to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be
desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, or withstand any continuing or future
downturn in our business.

**_If we are unable to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants included in the Senior Facilities Agreement_**
**_and/or the Indenture, certain of our existing or any future financing agreements, there could be a default under such_**
**_agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment._**

As described in the preceding risk factor, the Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain, and
certain of our existing financing arrangements and any future financing agreements we may enter into may
contain, certain financial and restrictive covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants, including
meeting incurrence- or maintenance-based financial ratios and tests, depends on a number of factors, some
of which may be beyond our control, such as a deterioration of the industry and markets in which we
operate or a deviation from the assumptions contained in our business plan. As a result, we may be unable
to comply with our financial and restrictive covenants, and any failure may materially adversely affect our
margins and results of operations and financial condition.

The breach of a financial or other covenant or our failure to meet any of our obligations under any of the
agreements governing our debt may result in a default under such agreements, which in turn could result in
a number of adverse consequences including, prohibiting us from drawing additional funds under credit
facilities, significant increases in interest rates and other financing costs, the acceleration of all outstanding
amounts under such agreements requiring us to immediately repay the related debt in whole or in part,
and/or the commencement of foreclosure or other enforcement actions against any of our assets securing

41


-----

such debt. In addition, any default may expose us to requests by our suppliers for advance payments for
deliveries and a reduction or cancellation by credit insurers of their commitments. Defaults may also
trigger cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses contained in our other debt agreements, including the
Indenture and Senior Facilities Agreement, and our liquid funds and short-term cash flow may be
insufficient to service any of the debts in the circumstances described above. Accordingly, any failure by us
to service our debts may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including
under the Notes.

A breach of any of the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement (which include a financial
maintenance covenant for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility) or the occurrence
of certain specified events will, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations, result in an event
of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Majority Lenders (being, subject to certain exceptions, lenders under the
Senior Facilities Agreement whose commitments thereunder aggregate at least 66[2]⁄3% of the total
commitments, or, as the case may be, the revolving facility commitments thereunder) could, while such
event of default remains unremedied or unwaived, cancel the availability of the Senior Facilities
Agreement and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement, together
with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default or event of default under the
Senior Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture.

If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of
amounts owing to them under such other debt instruments, there can be no assurance that our assets and
the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities
of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes,
in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against
any security interests granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to_**
**_meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

We have, and after the Offering, we will have significant debt service obligations. Our ability to make
principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our drawings under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend
on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond
our control. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Market’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Business and Products’’. If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources_
are insufficient to pay our various obligations as they mature or to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, we
and our subsidiaries may be forced, among other things, to reduce or delay business activities and capital
expenditure, sell assets, or forego opportunities such as acquisitions of further products. There can be no
assurance that any of these alternatives can be accomplished on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at
all.

The indebtedness under the Term Loan Facilities, and the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior
Facilities Agreement will mature in 2025 and 2024, respectively, and the Notes will mature in 2027 See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes’’. In addition, we have
ongoing requirements to pay interest when due on our indebtedness. To the extent our cash flows from
operating activities are insufficient to meet our liquidity needs, service our debt or provide required cash
collateral under our financing arrangements, we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing. At
the maturity of loans outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement and of the obligations under the
Notes and any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other
capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or we are otherwise
restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance
our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such
refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business obligations,
acquisitions, activities or capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional debt or equity financing in
amounts that could be substantial, or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the
Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these
alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that those actions would secure sufficient
funds to meet our obligations under our indebtedness.

42


-----

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition
at such time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the
international credit and capital markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than
our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or
future debt instruments and the Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement may restrict us from
adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on
our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which
could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

Further, we may be compelled to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes,
on or before their maturity. We may face the additional risk that in order to refinance our debt, we could
be required to agree to more onerous covenants, which would further restrict our business operations.

In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet
our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the
Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and the use
of proceeds from any such disposal. We may not be able to carry out certain disposals or to obtain the
funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize
from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due. These
alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations.

**_Drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement bear, and future indebtedness that we may incur
could bear, interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR (or any replacement
benchmark) as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the
future. Although we intend to enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase significantly, our
interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting
investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily
EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate
EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates
and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international
regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into
force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration
of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or
benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted.
For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer
persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the
‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and
Wholesale Policy at the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current
basis cannot and will not be guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication after
2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner
of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in
changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment
to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such
benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a
sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on
our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed disposals._**

From and following the Issue Date, the Notes and the Guarantee will be secured with security interests
over Collateral that also secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any outstanding
hedging or cash management liabilities and/or liabilities in connection with additional bilateral agreements
that are permitted to be secured by the same collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other
obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who also serves as the security agent
for the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the hedging obligations, the cash management
obligations and/or liabilities in connection with additional bilateral agreements which are permitted by the
Indenture to be secured with security interests over the Collateral, and any additional debt permitted to be
incurred and secured with security interests over Collateral by the Indenture, will act only as provided for
in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the
ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.
The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing
Group (as defined herein under ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’)
that, as of the Issue Date, comprises creditors holding in aggregate more than 50% of the aggregate
commitments or loans under the Existing Facilities and the Notes. As of the Issue Date and after giving
effect to the Transactions (including the use of proceeds therefrom), the aggregate principal amount of the
commitments and loans under the Existing Facilities will be greater than the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes. As a result, holders of Notes will not have effective control of whether to enforce the security
interests in the Collateral and as to the manner of such enforcement. In addition, the Indenture will permit
us to incur additional indebtedness that may be secured by the Collateral on a _pari passu basis. To the_
extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a _pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting_
interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurately with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future
may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the Collateral at a time
when it would be and/or in a manner that would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of other respects.
Other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against
the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek
protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be
impaired or reduced in value.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer, a debtor or any
holding company of a debtor as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and/or the Guarantee against, and
the liens over any other assets of, such entities may be released. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security; Release of Collateral’’._

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Guarantee will be secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this
Offering Memorandum, which Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, certain cash management obligations, certain hedging obligations and/or liabilities in
connection with additional bilateral agreements. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking
_pari passu with the Notes (including non-priority hedging arrangements) to the extent permitted by the_
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the
Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the pari passu debt secured by the Collateral or a
reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of
the economies in which our operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the
Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the

44


-----

Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, there can be no
assurance that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there
will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity
may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

**_Certain of the security interests granted in favor of the holders of the Notes will not rank pari passu with the security_**
**_interests granted in favor of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and holders of the Notes are relying on_**
**_the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve a first priority lien in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

We will enter into new Security Documents over the Collateral to secure the indebtedness represented by
the Notes. Under German law, certain security interests (such as pledges over shares or bank accounts)
granted under those new Security Documents will, because they are granted at a later point of time, rank
behind the security interests securing the Senior Facilities Agreement. However, pursuant to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes will be treated and deemed to be secured by the Collateral on a
_pari passu basis with the Senior Facilities Agreement. Therefore, the first-priority right in the Collateral_
granted in favor of the holders of the Notes will depend on the enforceability of the Intercreditor
Agreement. If the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were found to be invalid or
held to be unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the holders of the
Notes would not benefit from such first-priority treatment and the security interests granted in favor of the
holders of the Notes would rank behind, and be subordinated to, any prior-ranking security interests,
including the security interests granted in favor of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_The granting of shared security interests in connection with the incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create_**
**_or restart hardening periods, i.e. the periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such_**
**_security interest may be challenged in accordance with German law._**

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the
Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods for such security interests in Germany or certain
jurisdictions, in particular as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor
of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness,
the transfer of Collateral among the Issuer and its subsidiaries from time to time and the implementation
of certain corporate reorganizations. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can
run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. If the security interests
granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in
such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it. Please see
‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations’’._

The same rights also apply following the Offering in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries
as additional guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests
for the benefit of the noteholders. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Security; Release of Collateral’’.

**_The Guarantee and each security interest may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may_**
**_limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct, limited recourse claim against the
Parent Guarantor and, as a result will be limited to the proceeds from enforcement of the pledge over the
issued share capital of the Issuer. In addition, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will secure the payment
of the Notes by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. However, each security interest
granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to
be subject to that security interest and the Indenture will provide that the Guarantee will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor, without rendering the Guarantee/
security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under German or other applicable law or without
resulting in a breach of any applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee/Security Document would
be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to
corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. See ‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’._

45


-----

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws,
guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the insolvency administrator in case of insolvency
of the Parent Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of the Parent Guarantor outside insolvency), and a
court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void,
any legal act performed by the Parent Guarantor (including the granting by it of the Guarantee or the
security interests granted under the Security Documents, see ‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’) and, if_
payment had already been made under the Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security
Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to
the relevant Guarantor, if the court found, inter alia, that:

- the amount paid or payable under the Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant
Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

- the Guarantee or the relevant security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Parent Guarantor or, in certain
jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Parent Guarantor was insolvent when
it granted the Guarantee or relevant security interest;

- the Parent Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting
the Guarantee/relevant security interests and the Parent Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the Guarantee/relevant security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or
believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or

- the Guarantee/relevant Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Parent
Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Parent Guarantor or
security provider.

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)
or custodian (Sachwalter) may challenge (anfechten) transactions (Rechtsgesch¨aft) or acts
(Rechtshandlungen) that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to
the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by
other creditors that have the benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes
from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including
the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of
certain jurisdictions.

The security interests granted in favor of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral in certain jurisdictions. The Security Agent
may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. There can be no
assurance that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure holders of
the Notes that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or
foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose
upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

In addition, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the
sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_**
**_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by applicable law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations
of the Parent Guarantor under the Guarantee will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but
will be granted in favor, among others, of the Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of

46


-----

the Notes in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents
related to the Collateral. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only
the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of
the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.

Under German law, accessory security interests such as pledges over shares or bank accounts cannot be
granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security
interests. In this respect, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a so-called parallel
debt obligation (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer
and the Parent Guarantor toward the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the
‘‘Principal Obligations’’). Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will at all
times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations discharges the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect
of the Parallel Debt discharges the corresponding Principal Obligations, in each case, by the amount of
such payment.

Certain of the Security Documents will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. In Germany there is no statutory or case law available on
the validity or enforceability of the parallel debt construct or the security provided for such parallel debt.
To the extent the Parallel Debt construct would be successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to receive any proceeds from the enforcement of the security interests in the
relevant Collateral. In addition, holders of the Notes will bear the risk associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent or a breach of its obligations as Security Agent towards the
secured creditors. See ‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’._

**_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or offer to purchase the Notes, the Issuer may, at its option,_**
**_redeem the Notes of non-tendering holders._**

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the Notes, holders of not less than 90% of
the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes, all of the holders of Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender offer or other offer and,
accordingly, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes
at a price equivalent to that paid pursuant to such purchase or tender offer (excluding any early tender
premium). As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes at a price
equivalent to the lowest price paid to tendering holders, including if such price is below par, and may not
receive the return they expect to receive on the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption
_upon Certain Tender Offers’’._

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes receive a rating of
‘‘BBB�’’ or better from S&P or Fitch and ‘‘Baa3’’ or better from Moody’s and no default or event of
default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time that the
Notes receive a rating of below ‘‘BBB’’ from S&P or Fitch and below ‘‘Baa3’’ from Moody’s, certain
covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Covenants—Suspension
_of Covenants’’. If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional_
indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests
of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes, will ever achieve an investment grade
rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they may be_**
**_sold._**

The Notes and the Guarantee have not been registered under, and the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor
are not obliged to register the Notes or the Guarantee under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an
exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act

47


-----

and any other applicable laws. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’. The Issuer and the Parent Guarantor have not
agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes or the Guarantee, and do not have any intention
to do so.

**_The market value of the Notes may be adversely affected if additional notes are considered to have OID and are not_**
**_distinguishable from the Notes._**

The Issuer may issue additional notes (‘‘Additional Notes’’) as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes’’.
These Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the
original Notes in some cases, may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
such a case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have OID which may adversely affect the market
value of the original Notes as it will not be possible to distinguish the original Notes from the Additional
Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore holders of the Notes must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depository (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of
principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the
Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as Paying Agent, which will make payments to
Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold
book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect
participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of
book-entry interests. Accordingly, if holders own a book-entry interest in the Notes, they must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if they are not a participant in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which they own an interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights
to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if holders of the Notes own a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only to the extent
they have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will
be sufficient to enable holders of the Notes to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the definitive
registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if a holder owns a book-entry interest, it
will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. There can be no assurance that the
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case the ability of holders of the Notes to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

There can be no assurance as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- the ability of holders of the Notes to sell their Notes; or

- the prices at which holders of the Notes would be able to sell their Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in
the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be
adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that
may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may
affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to

48


-----

disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on holders of the Notes regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading
market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, holders of the Notes may not be able to resell
their holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, there
can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the
liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on a stock exchange, failure to be approved for
listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of
the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s
ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact
the liquidity of the Notes.

**Risks Related to our Structure**

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes and the Guarantee will be released automatically and under which the Guarantee will be released_**
**_automatically, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the consent of the Trustee._**

There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes in full under which the
security interests over the Collateral, the Guarantee or any future guarantee of the Notes will be released
automatically without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the Trustee. Under various circumstances,
all or a portion of the security interests over the Collateral may be released automatically, including:

- the sale or other disposition of such property or asset to a person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the provisions of the covenant described
under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Covenants-Limitation on Asset Sale’’;

- in the case of a Guarantor that is releases from its Guarantee, the release of the property, asset and
capital stock of such Guarantor;

- if the Issuer designates any of its Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary as permitted under and
in compliance with the Indenture, the release of the property, asset and capital stock of such
Subsidiary;

- with respect to any property or assets that become Collateral pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the
provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens’’, upon the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of the initial_
lien that gave rise to the obligation to provide for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, to the extent
that such initial lien does not secure any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (as defined under ‘‘Description
_of the Notes—Certain Definitions’’);_

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document; and

- as a result of a transaction permitted by the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘Description of
_the Notes—Covenants—Mergers and Consolidation’’._

Under various circumstances, the Guarantee and any future guarantee of the Notes will be released
automatically, including:

- (i) other than in respect of the Parent Guarantor, upon the sale or other disposition of any capital
stock of the relevant future Guarantor as a result of which such guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Guarantor to a person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Covenants_Limitation on Asset Sale’’;_

- upon the release of the guarantee of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the relevant
guarantee of the Notes under the covenant described below under ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Covenants—Future Guarantors’’ so long as no Event of Default would arise as a result and no other_
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor at that time is guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor;

49


-----

- if the Issuer designates any of its Subsidiaries that have guaranteed the Notes to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary as permitted under and in compliance with the Indenture;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document; and

- as a result of a transaction permitted by the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘Description of
_the Notes—Covenants—Mergers and Consolidation’’._

**_The Notes and the Guarantee will be effectively subordinated to additional indebtedness that we may incur to the_**
**_extent such debt is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes._**

Although the Indenture restricts the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pledge any assets as
collateral to secure other debt and requires the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure the Notes
equally and ratably if we pledge any assets for the benefit of certain other debt, both the restriction on
pledging assets or incurring liens and the requirement to provide equal security to the Notes are subject to
a number of significant exceptions and carve-outs. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Covenants—Limitation
_on Liens’’. For example, if the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries acquire assets subject to security interests_
securing other indebtedness, such security interests will be permitted to remain in place under the terms of
the Indenture and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or Guarantee equally and ratably. To
the extent the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries pledges any assets for the benefit of other debt
without also securing the Notes, the Notes and the Guarantee will be effectively subordinated to such debt
to the extent of the value of such assets. As a result of the foregoing, holders of (present or future) secured
debt of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor may recover disproportionately more on their claims than the
holders of the Notes in an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. The Issuer and the Parent
Guarantor may not have sufficient assets remaining to satisfy our obligations under the Notes or the
Guarantee, respectively.

**_The Notes and the Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any)_**
**_of our subsidiaries._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will
guarantee the Notes. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, the Issuer (before consolidating
effects) represented 100.4% of our consolidated EBITDA and, as of September 30, 2019, the Issuer
represented 100.0% of our total assets. As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will be
Restricted Subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor is a holding company without independent business
operations whose only significant assets are the shares in the Issuer and rights under certain loans made to
the Issuer. As of the Issue Date, none of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of
creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if
any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the
claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes. In the event of any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their
trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries
before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and the
Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and
preference shareholders (if any) of our subsidiaries.

**_The security interests in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party
and/or the grantor of the security. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be
perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the
actions required to perfect any of these security interests. Absent perfection, the Security Agent, on behalf
of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the
Collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who
claim a security interest in the same Collateral. See ‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantee and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’._

50


-----

**_The insolvency laws of the Germany and other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the_**
**_U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany and has its statutory seat in Germany. Therefore,
Germany is presumed to be the center of main interests of the Issuer and the Issuer can be subjected to
insolvency proceedings in this jurisdiction. Such insolvency proceedings applicable to the Issuer will be
governed by German insolvency laws, subject to certain exceptions as provided for in the EU Insolvency
Regulation. German insolvency laws are different from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, and this
may limit a prospective investor’s ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the
limitations arising under other insolvency laws. See ‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantee and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’._

In addition, under German insolvency laws, the validity of an appointment of an agent for service of
process granted by a German entity, such as the appointment by the Issuer of agents for service of process
under New York law under the Indenture and under English law under the Intercreditor Agreement, is
uncertain. Furthermore, such appointments will terminate automatically in the case of an insolvency of the
Issuer. As such, the ability of the holders of the Notes to bring suit against the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor in New York or England may be limited.

The Parent Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of Germany. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Germany or another relevant jurisdiction. The
bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Parent Guarantor’s or any
future guarantor’s jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in
conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors,
priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether
any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect the ability of the holders of the Notes and
the Trustee to enforce their rights under the Notes and the Guarantee in those jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that holders of the Notes may receive. See ‘‘Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Guarantee and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’ with respect to the_
jurisdictions mentioned above.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a ‘‘change of control’’, the Issuer would be required to
offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a
change of control were to occur, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient funds available at
such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the
outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such
required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an
obligation to mandatorily prepay the Existing Facilities and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the
Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of
control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash
to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then
existing financial resources. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are
prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the
consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance
the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained,
the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would
require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. There
can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to
purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a
default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control’’._

**_We may not be able to repay the Notes, when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant_**
**_to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the_**
**_Indenture may not necessarily afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of certain important corporate_**
**_events._**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes, following an event of default
including a cross acceleration event, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes, will become due
and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of
the Notes, may in certain circumstances require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders
_upon a Change of Control’’. The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for_
additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due. The Issuer’s failure to repay holders
tendering Notes, upon the occurrence of a change of control event would result in an event of default
under the Notes. There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to repay our outstanding
indebtedness which we would be required to prepay or offer to purchase or that became immediately due
and payable as a result. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases
and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all.
Restrictions in our other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict us from making such
required repurchases.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford holders of the
Notes protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization,
restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the
Notes, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or,
even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘Change of Control’’ as defined in the Indenture. Except as described
under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control’’, the
Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is
a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’, there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’
of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes.

**_The interests of our shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of the Notes._**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our shareholders, directly or indirectly, were certain
members of the Braun family. See ‘‘Principal Shareholders’’. The interests of our ultimate shareholders
could conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our shareholders could also have an interest in
pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to the
holders of the Notes. Finally, our direct and indirect shareholders may have strategic objectives or business
interests that could conflict with our own strategies or interests. If the interests of our principal
shareholders conflict with our interests or the interests of the holders of the Notes, or if our principal
shareholders engage in activities or pursue strategic objectives that conflict with our interests or the
interest of the holders of the Notes, we and holders of the Notes could be disadvantaged.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the values of the euro relative to the
currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic,
political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by
reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the

52


-----

effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the
return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return
on their investments. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains or
losses from any investment in the Notes. See ‘‘Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations’’ if
you are a U.S. holder whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Parent Guarantor and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United
States, and the substantial majority of our business is conducted outside the United States. We expect the
directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor to be non-residents of
the United States, and all or substantially all of their assets will be located outside the United States.
Although we and the Parent Guarantor will submit to the jurisdiction of certain U.S. federal and New York
state courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, holders of the Notes may be unable to
effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In
addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor and their respective
subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States,
holders of the Notes may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.
Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor
may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is
not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Germany. There is, therefore, doubt as
to the enforceability in Germany of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such
jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether
or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is
also doubt that a court in Germany would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought
in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. See
‘‘Service of Process and Enforceability of Civil Liabilities’’.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies are expected to assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at
any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time
or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the
cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the
Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the gross proceeds of the Offering to be A500.0 million. We will use the gross proceeds from the
Offering together with cash on hand to (i) repay the Refinancing Indebtedness (including accrued and
unpaid interest as well as premiums, prepayment fees and breakage costs, if any), (ii) finance the purchase
price for the Sake Acquisition and (iii) pay costs, fees and expenses related to the Transactions.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of the Transactions. The actual amounts set
forth in the table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustment and may differ at the time
of the consummation of the Transactions, depending on several factors, including differences from our
estimate of fees, expenses, debt balances and accrued interest. You should read the table below in
conjunction with the information contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, particularly under
the headings ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements’’.

between the estimated purchase price for the Sake Acquisition and the actual purchase price payable at closing will be funded
from cash on hand.

**Overview**

We are a leading specialty pharmaceuticals company headquartered in Greifswald, Germany, with an
international footprint and a broad portfolio of more than 90 products across more than ten therapeutic
areas, including cardiology, oncology and infectious diseases. We focus on acquiring well established,
off-patent, branded legacy and niche originator pharmaceutical products with predictable cash flows from
large pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies regularly seek to dispose of these products to
reduce the complexity of their product portfolio and because these products no longer fit their business
model, even if still profitable. They seek reliable and experienced buyers, such as us, to dispose of these
products given that maintaining market supply is paramount to mitigate potential reputational risk. We
have a strong track record of ensuring uninterrupted supply, and are typically able to generate additional
value from these well established, off-patent branded legacy and niche originator products by reducing
complexity and costs throughout the value chain. We achieve that due to our lean setup, including
outsourced manufacturing, as well as through our outsourced global distribution capabilities. Since our
inception in 1998, we have established relationships with more than ten different pharmaceutical
companies by acquiring their products. We believe that our track record of successful acquisitions and our
proven ability to integrate new products into our business in a timely and seamless manner make us a
preferred partner for many large pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb
and Roche.

We operate a lean business model focused on (i) selecting and acquiring suitable off-patent, branded niche
or legacy originator products or product portfolios that fit our disciplined acquisition criteria, (ii) managing
the transfer of the required approvals to market them across various countries and (iii) integrating them
into our established value chain of contract manufacturing organizations (‘‘CMOs’’) and distributors. With
no own manufacturing facilities or sales force, our asset light business model typically enables us to reduce
production as well as sales and marketing costs by outsourcing production and distribution of our products
to third parties. Our large network of CMOs allows us to choose the partner which is able to offer the
lowest production costs and best quality for a specific product or pharmaceutical form. In addition, we may
be able to achieve economies of scale and negotiate favorable terms with CMOs by bundling the
production of various products with the same CMO.

We distribute our products in more than 120 countries across six continents, predominantly through our
extensive network of distribution partners, with many of whom we have long-standing relationships. Not
maintaining our own distribution capabilities in the majority of the countries we operate in allows us to
choose local distribution partners who we believe are best suited for a specific product and to focus on the
most efficient distribution channel. At the same time, we may be able to realize efficiencies by bundling the
distribution of various products with the same distribution partner.

Given our business model and the off-patent status of our products, we do not develop products and have
no research and development (‘‘R&D’’) activities of our own. Therefore, we are not exposed to the
significant risks and upfront investments that are associated with the development of new pharmaceutical
products. In addition, given that our products have typically been on the market and off-patent for a
prolonged time, there is a very limited need to invest in product improvements, line extensions or similar
measures.

- Shares in sales of Xenical�, Lexotan�, Cymeveme� and Visudyne� in Switzerland as well as of Atacand� in Sweden are
influenced by the geographic location of sellers under the transitional services agreements (Roche and Novartis in Switzerland
and AstraZeneca in Sweden).

As a result of this diversification, we are not dependent on a single product or geography. Our products are
used by a diverse customer base including consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, mail-order
companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as well as
public or private health insurance organizations. We estimate that our primary customer groups are
physicians, hospitals and patients paying for their products ‘out-of-pocket’. Our products typically also
benefit from a loyal customer base which has used or prescribed the product for many years and, therefore,
is less likely to switch to a different product. We believe that these ‘‘pull factors’’ are particularly
characteristic of prescription drugs, sales of which represented approximately 94% of our sales for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 with approximately 5% being generated from the sale of OTC products.
Finally, competition for our products is often limited or well-known. Our products have typically been
off-patent for several years and the competitive landscape has settled by the time we acquire the products.
This is because generic products are typically launched immediately after patent protection for the
originator product expired. Accordingly, the sales decline for an originator product is most severe
immediately following expiry of patent protection and hence, by the time we acquire a branded originator
product, the risk of new products entering the market is relatively low, driven by non-compelling
economics for new entrants given the niche or legacy nature of the sub-segment of the pharmaceutical
industry in which we operate.

Our business has grown significantly in recent years. We have increased our revenues and EBITDA before
non-recurring items from A132.5 million and A69.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2016 to A460.6 million and A253.9 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.
During the same period, we achieved an average EBITDA before non-recurring items margin of 53.4%. In
addition, our asset light business model allowed us to realize a Cash Conversion Ratio of 64.1% for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We believe that the future growth of our business is supported by a number of favorable long-term trends.
We expect that there will continue to be attractive acquisition candidates available to us as a result of large
pharmaceutical companies reducing the complexity of their portfolio and focusing on newer patented
products. This expectation is underpinned by a substantial proportion of currently marketed
pharmaceutical products for which patent protection will expire by 2024, a trend expected to continue in
later years as ‘‘blockbuster’’ and other drugs lose patent protection, as well as the continuing trend toward
mergers & acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry, which we expect will result in the realignment of
product portfolios. At the same time, we expect that the broader pharmaceutical industry will continue to
grow in the future as a result of rising medical needs driven by a growing and ageing population, the

the awareness and availability of healthcare and increasing national income in emerging markets.

**Factors Affecting our Results of Operations**

**_Growth through Acquisitions_**

Acquisitions of trademarks and marketing authorizations for branded specialty and niche pharmaceutical
products to expand our product portfolio have been the key driver of our growth in the period under
review and have more than offset the natural decline in revenues that is typical of our products. In
particular, our acquisitions of trademarks and marketing authorizations for new products since 2016 have
significantly contributed to our growth, with revenue increasing from A132.5 million in 2016 to
A314.7 million in 2018 and A460.6 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Over the same
period, our EBITDA has increased from A69.6 million in 2016 to A183.8 million in 2018 and A263.3 million
in the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

In 2016, we acquired the product rights for Anexate� and Vesanoid� Japan as well as the anti-obesity
product Xenical and in 2017 we completed the acquisition of the beta-blocker Dilatrend�. In 2017,
Xenical� and Dilatrend� accounted for almost half of our sales. In 2018, our significant acquisitions
included the takeover of the products Atacand� from Roche, Visudyne� from Novartis and Fungizone�
from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which, together with smaller acquisitions in 2018 and our acquisitions in the
prior year, helped to drive revenue growth of 32.9% to A314.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017. In the
nine months ended September 30, 2019, our primary acquisition was the USD 213 million (excluding
milestone payments) purchase of Losec� from AstraZeneca, which closed on September 30, 2019. As a
result of our significant acquisition activity, cash flow from operating activities increased from A54.1 million
in 2016 to A97.4 million in 2017 and A98.7 million in 2018, supported by our business model (with no own
production), net sales and our lean cost structure.

Historically, our acquisitions have typically been immediately accretive to gross profit (see ‘‘—Transitional
_Service Agreements’’ below), although transaction costs have resulted in increases in interest expenses and_
other operating expenses during the periods in which the acquisitions occurred as well as higher costs of
materials following consummation of the acquisitions, which, in 2018, contributed to a decrease in earnings
after income taxes. Since mid-2018, our product acquisitions have been financed through additional
indebtedness. We intend to continue to finance future acquisitions through additional debt financing, but
may also finance certain smaller acquisitions from cash flow from operating activities.

**_Transitional Service Agreements_**

Following acquisition of a new product, in each of the countries of the transferred territory, the registration
of the trademarks needs to be transferred from the seller to us by notifying the competent registers of the
trademark assignment and the marketing authorizations will be transferred from the seller to us by filing
transfer applications with each of the relevant governmental authorities. This can take between six months
or up to several years, depending on the country. Therefore, pending approval of the transfer of the
product registration, we enter into a transitional service agreement (‘‘TSA’’) and, as the case may be, a
related (manufacturing) supply and quality agreement (‘‘MSQA/MSA/SQA’’) with the seller to ensure
continuous manufacturing and sale of the acquired product. TSA services may also include various other
services like forecasting, invoicing, customer support, pharmacovigilance activities, warehousing and
quality assurance. During the TSA phase, the seller typically continues to manufacture and distribute the
product for our account and transfers to us, on a monthly or quarterly basis, revenue from further product
sales (net of materials and, depending on the seller, distribution expenses, discounts, rebates and other
allowances) in exchange for a service fee of approximately 5-9% of net sales. We recognize the net
amounts received from the seller under TSAs (including royalty payments) as revenues and record the
TSA service fees as other operating expenses. Therefore, while revenue may be understated (from an
economic point of view) compared to if the transfer of the product registration had taken place
immediately, due to such arrangements under TSAs, EBITDA is not impacted after the completion of the
TSA arrangement period. In addition, certain of our TSAs provide for quarterly payments in arrears. As a
result of such arrangements, we may only receive payments for sales made under the respective TSA in a
subsequent quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we generated approximately 43% of
our sales under TSAs.

Following transfer of the marketing authorization in each applicable country, we purchase remaining
inventory from the seller or the seller’s local affiliates in each country. As inventory prices may be

61


-----

determined by the seller’s local affiliates, the seller may be obligated to provide us with a one-time transfer
payment to compensate for prices higher than those agreed with the local affiliate’s parent company in the
relevant asset purchase agreement. In exceptional cases we may also acquire the existing inventory prior to
transfer of the marketing authorization at closing of the acquisition.

Following transfer of the marketing authorization and the purchase of remaining inventory, we assume
responsibility for the manufacturing of the product (through our outsourcing manufacturing partners) and
product distribution (through third-party distributors). From this point in time, we collect all revenues
from product sales and incur all costs. As a result, as marketing authorizations are transitioned to us, our
expenses shift from TSA service fees to manufacturing and distributor fees. Due to the favorable cost
structure of the outsourcing of production and our extensive global distribution network, we believe we are
able to realize attractive margins.

Notwithstanding the generality of the above we may in certain cases deviate from this concept both on the
supply side and well as on the sales side. For example, in the event new manufacturing sources for API or
finished products might prove difficult to establish (for factual or legal reasons) we may retain the seller as
manufacturer for a period exceeding the TSA phase. Similarly, on the supply side, we may (for various
reasons) from time to time enter into transitional distribution agreements extending distribution services
beyond the TSA phase.

**_Cost Reduction and Value Enhancement Measures_**

Given that the products we acquire are often characterized by declining revenue over time, we seek to
improve margins through various key value levers which are critical to achieving our targeted return on
investment following the acquisition of a new product. These key value levers primarily comprise measures
to reduce overhead (such as sales and marketing expenses) and complexity (through centralized marketing
authorization management), lower production costs (through outsourcing to third-party manufacturers)
and optimize manufacturing arrangements and active pricing strategies and product offering
enhancements. Product cost optimization through outsourced production by CMOs and, in turn, reduced
production costs is the most important value lever and typically accounts for most of the cost savings we
are able to achieve through our cost reduction and value enhancement programs.

For example, we have successfully integrated two of our largest products, Xenical� and Dilatrend�, which
we acquired from Roche in 2016 and 2017, respectively, while at the same time increasing the gross margin
of these products. Roche divested both products because they did no longer strategically fit its portfolio
due the relatively low sales volume per country and to reduce complexity in its product portfolio. Following
completion of the acquisitions, we reduced production costs by negotiating lower packaging costs with the
incumbent CMO. We are also in the process of transferring the API supply for Xenical� to a new supplier,
which we expect will result in annual cost savings of approximately A5 million beginning in 2022. At the
same time, we realized new revenue potential by integrating the product into our existing distribution
network, through targeted marketing activities of our distributors and introducing tender management.

**_Financing Arrangements_**

During the period under review, we incurred a significant amount of additional financial indebtedness to
finance our acquisitions of new products, which, in turn, resulted in considerable increases in interest
expenses and net finance cost. Interest expenses increased from A5,956 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to A75,001 thousand for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, while net
finance cost increased from A5,806 thousand to A53,939 thousand over the same period.

In particular, in July 2018, we refinanced a significant portion of our then existing capital structure and
financing arrangements when we entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement, comprising a A530 million
term loan and a A250 million revolving credit facility (increased to A310 million on July 26, 2018), to repay
an existing syndicated loan and redeem outstanding notes. In November 2018, the term loan was increased
by an additional A300 million to refinance the revolving credit facility. In early January 2019, we drew
A190 million under the revolving credit facility and repaid A40 million at the beginning of February. In June
2019, we refinanced the revolving credit facility by increasing the TLB by A150 million. In September 2019,
we drew A150 million under the revolving credit facility in order to partially finance the acquisition of
Losec�, resulting in A150 million being drawn as of September 30, 2019. Finally, in late November 2019, we
entered into a $124 million facility agreement to fund the acquisition of the European and North
American rights to Seroquel� from AstraZeneca.

and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements’’.

**Key Income Statement Items**

Set forth below is a summary description of the key line items of our consolidated income statement:

**_Revenue_**

Revenue consists of sales of pharmaceutical products, food supplements, medical products and cosmetics.
Revenue is regularly recognized at the time performance is rendered or the risk passes to the customer.
However, during the period newly acquired products are distributed under a TSA, we only receive the
gross profits with respect to these products which are recognized as revenues (net of cash discounts and
rebates). See ‘‘—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Transitional Services Agreements’’.

**_Change in inventories_**

Change in inventories reflects the change between the opening and closing balances of work in progress
and finished goods. Inventories comprises raw materials, consumables and supplies, work in progress and
finished goods and merchandise as well as prepayments.

**_Cost of materials_**

Cost of materials comprises almost entirely the costs of procurement of goods and contract manufacturing
incurred in connection with the manufacture of our products and, to a much lesser, third party services,
freight and other costs.

**_Personnel expenses_**

Personnel expenses include wages and salaries, social security costs and other staff costs.

**_Amortization, depreciation and impairments_**

Amortization, depreciation and impairments consist primarily of straight-line charges over the useful life
of intangible assets. The main items comprise marketing authorizations and, to a significantly lower extent,
software. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment accounts for only a small portion of our total
amortization, depreciation and impairments. Impairment is tested in accordance with applicable
accounting rules, and no impairments were recorded in 2017, 2018 or the first nine months of 2019.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses consist primarily of distribution and delivery costs, costs related to drug safety,
licenses and quality assurance, net foreign exchange gains or losses and sundry items. Sundry items include
legal and advisory expenses as well as IT expenses.

**_Net finance cost_**

Net finance costs comprises of net income from investments, interest income and interest expenses. Net
income from investments includes the dividend income from securities classified as current assets. Net
interest expenses primarily includes interest paid on bank loans, interest on loans granted by related
parties and losses incurred in connection with derivative financial instruments less interest income.

**_Income taxes_**

Income tax includes current and deferred income and trade tax as well as foreign income tax. The tax rate
applicable to our operations for each financial year mainly depends on the profitability of our German
operations where the significant majority of our earnings accrues.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by A145,916 thousand, or 71.9%, from A203,027 thousand in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to A348,943 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Lexotan� and Dormicum� from Roche in January
2019 and the revenue contribution from new products acquired in the course of 2018 for the entire period
in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Due to the different TSA stages of various acquired
products and the related invoicing of profits to the sellers of products while the products remain under a
TSA, concentrations of revenue in Switzerland (Roche), the United States (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and
Sweden (AstraZeneca) were elevated in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same
period in the prior year.

_Cost of materials_

Cost of materials increased by A71,441 thousand from A56,952 thousand in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to A128,393 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in procurement of goods and contract manufacturing, from A56,104 thousand
for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to A127,068 thousand for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019, which related to new product acquisitions which were no longer under TSAs for the
period (or a portion thereof) compared to the prior period.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by A3,595 thousand, or 32.7%, from A11,005 thousand in the nine months
ended September 30, 2018 to A14,600 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The
increase was primarily due to increase in salaries and wages, from A8,929 thousand for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018 to A12,026 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as well as
increases in social security costs resulting from the increase in headcount from 251 as of December 31,
2018 to 304 as of September 30, 2019 to support the regulatory and pharmacovigilance functions for our
new products.

-----

_Amortization, depreciation and impairments_

Amortization, depreciation and impairments increased by A29,212 thousand, or 36.5%, from
A79,947 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to A109,159 thousand in the nine months
ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Lexotan� and
Dormicum� from Roche, for which the marketing authorizations and trademarks were capitalized as part
of the transactions, as well as the revenue contributions of our acquisitions in the first nine months of 2018.
No impairment was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by A13,010 thousand, or 41.9%, from A31,050 thousand in the nine
months ended September 30, 2018 to A44,060 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The
increase was primarily due to higher distribution and delivery costs, from A15,479 thousand for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018 to A25,159 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2019,
resulting from our additional acquisitions of products. The increase was also due, in part, to increases in
the cost of drug safety, licenses and quality assurance related to the expansion of our product portfolio as
well as the corresponding increase in the number of products under TSA arrangements.

_Net finance cost_

Net finance cost decreased by A9,838 thousand, or 19.4%, from A50,736 thousand in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to A40,898 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was
primarily due to the increase in interest income, from A19 thousand in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to A15,891 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which resulted
from the revaluation gain of financial liabilities.

_Taxes on income_

Taxes on income increased by A21,227 thousand from an income of A3,156 thousand in the nine months
ended September 30, 2018 to an expense of A18,071 thousand in the nine months ended September 30,
2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, which increased from
a loss of A22,068 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to income of A37,965 thousand in
the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

_Earnings after income taxes_

Earnings after income taxes increased by A38,806 thousand from negative A18,912 thousand in the nine
months ended September 30, 2018 to A19,894 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The
increase was primarily due to the improved results of operations and the other factors described above.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by A77,867 thousand, or 32.9%, from A236,843 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A314,710 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase in revenue was primarily due to the acquisitions of Visudyne� and Atacand�/Atacand Plus�,
which led to increased revenue in EU countries, from A197,953 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2017 to A222,952 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, in North America, from
A5,380 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 to A31,385 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018, and in East Asia from A14,646 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
A23,359 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite declining revenues for our existing
products. Due to the different TSA stages of various acquired products and the related invoicing of profits
to the sellers of products while the products remain under a TSA, increases in and concentrations of
revenue in Switzerland (Roche and Novartis), the United States (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and Sweden
(AstraZeneca) were considerably higher in 2018 than the prior year but will decrease and diversify, on an
individual country basis, as individual transfers of marketing authorizations continue to occur in 2019. For
example, Dilatrend� and Xenical�, our top two products by revenue in 2018, remained in the TSA phase
for parts of the financial year 2018 only, while more recently acquired products, such as Atacand�,
Visudyne� and Fungizone� were in the TSA phase either for parts of or for the whole period.

_Cost of materials_

Cost of materials increased by A19,979 thousand, or 26.4%, from A75,631 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A95,610 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily
due to an increase in procurement of goods and contract manufacturing, from A74,571 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2017 to A94,164 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, which related
to new product acquisitions which no longer were under TSAs for the period (or a portion thereof)
compared to the prior year. The increase in cost of materials remained lower than that of revenue from
2017 to 2018 as product acquisitions continued to impact primarily the revenue and did not impact the cost
structure while new products remain in the TSA phase.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by A5,110 thousand, or 48.5%, from A10,542 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A15,652 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily
due to increases in wages and salaries as well as social security costs resulting from the increase in the

66


-----

average headcount from 199 employees in 2017 to 279 employees in 2018 to support the regulatory and
pharmacovigilance functions for our new products.

_Amortization, depreciation and impairments_

Amortization, depreciation and impairments increased by A27,279 thousand, or 35.7%, from
A76,459 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 to A103,738 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Konakion�, Lariam� and
Inhibace� from Roche, Visudyne� from Novartis and Sotalex� from Bristol-Myers Squibb, for which the
marketing authorizations and trademarks were capitalized as part of the transactions, as well as the first
full-year revenue contributions of our acquisitions in 2017. No impairment was recorded in 2017 or 2018.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by A9,845 thousand, or 33.4%, from A29,519 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to A39,364 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was
primarily due to higher distribution and delivery costs, from A16,051 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A24,297 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, in line with our revenue
growth from the acquisitions in 2017 and 2018. The increase was also due, in part, to increases in the cost
of drug safety, licenses and quality assurance related to the growth in our product portfolio.

_Net finance cost_

Net finance cost increased by A47,675 thousand from A16,102 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2017 to A63,777 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the
increase in interest paid on bank loans, from A16,517 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
A57,291 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, which include prepayments fees and transaction
costs of A25,576 thousand in connection with the repayment of the mezzanine financing in July 2018.

_Taxes on income_

Taxes on income decreased by A6,648 thousand from A13,145 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2017 to A6,497 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower
deferred taxes of A642 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to A8,199 thousand for
the year ended December 31, 2017, and the decrease in earnings before income taxes.

_Earnings after income taxes_

Earnings after income taxes decreased by A17,313 thousand from A27,160 thousand to A9,847 thousand for
the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to increased finance costs and the
other factors described above.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by A104,308 thousand, or 78.7%, from A132,535 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to A236,843 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was
primarily due an increase in revenue in non-EU countries from A62,255 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to A135,688 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, which related mainly to
revenue received for products under TSAs, particularly with Roche in Switzerland, resulting from the
acquisition of the products Anexate�, Xenical� and Vesanoid� Japan in 2016 and Dilatrend� in 2017. To a
lesser extent, the increase in revenue was due to the increase in revenue from distributors in EU countries
(excluding Germany) from A54,362 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 to A87,068 thousand
for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily related sales of the products Streptosil� and
Aldactone�, which are solely distributed in Italy. The increase was offset in part by average declines of
revenue among the rest of our other existing product portfolio.

_Cost of materials_

Cost of materials increased by A33,731 thousand, or 80.5%, from A41,900 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to A75,631 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily
due to an increase in procurement of goods and contract manufacturing, from A41,550 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2016 to A74,571 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, which related
to increases in production capacity following the acquisitions of Xenical in September 2016 and Dilatrend�
in January 2017.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by A3,906 thousand, or 58.9%, from A6,636 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to A10,542 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily
due to increases in wages and salaries as well as social security costs resulting from the increase in the
average headcount from 140 employees in 2016 to 199 employees in 2017 to support the regulatory and
pharmacovigilance functions for our new products.

_Amortization, depreciation and impairments_

Amortization, depreciation and impairments increased by A37,439 thousand, or 95.9%, from
A39,020 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 to A76,459 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Xenical� in September 2016 and
Dilatrend� in January 2017, for which the marketing authorizations and trademarks were capitalized as

68


-----

part of the transactions. No impairment was recorded in 2017, compared to impairment of A4,786 thousand
in 2016.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by A14,943 thousand from A14,576 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to A29,519 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily
due to higher distribution and delivery costs, from A8,038 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016
to A16,051 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, in line with the revenue growth from the
acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. The increase was also due, in part, to increases in the cost of drug safety,
licenses and quality assurance as well as sundry expenses.

_Net finance cost_

Net finance cost increased by A10,296 thousand from A5,806 thousand for the year ended December 31,
2016 to A16,102 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an
increase in interest expenses on banks loans from A4,829 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016
to A16,517 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was offset, in part, by
A1,584 thousand in income from dividends received from securities classified as current assets, which
resulted in an increase of A1,489 thousand in net income from investments.

_Taxes on income_

Taxes on income increased by A6,078 thousand, or 86.0%, from A7,067 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to A13,145 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily
due to increases in deferred taxes and corporate income and municipal trade taxes for 2017, as a result of
the increase in earnings before income taxes.

_Earnings after income taxes_

Earnings after income taxes increased by A9,463 thousand, or 53.5%, from A17,697 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to A27,160 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was
primarily due to the factors described above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements
of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures,
contractual obligations and other commitments.

Our financial condition and liquidity are and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors,
including, primarily, our ability to generate cash flows from our operations, the level of our outstanding
indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries and the interest we are obligated to pay on such
indebtedness. We expect our future sources of liquidity will consist mainly of cash generated from our
operating activities.

In addition, our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn,
depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’. Although we believe our expected cash flows from operating
activities will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you
that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future debt financing
will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes,
or to fund our other liquidity needs.

- Acquisitions of intangible assets (A489,767 thousands) for the year ended December 31, 2018 include earn-out related purchase
price adjustments in the amount of +A5,000 thousands. Without the earn-out related purchase price adjustments, the cash
outflow for the acquisiton of intangible assets would increase by A5,000 thousand with an opposite effect on other liabilities.

_Cash flow from operating activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by A72,320 thousand, or 51.7%, thousand from
A67,699 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to A140,019 thousand for the nine months
ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to a significant increase of our revenues
and an improved working capital management.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by A1,289 thousand, or 1.3%, from A97,379 thousand for the
year ended December 31, 2017 to A98,668 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase
was primarily a function of higher revenues as well as an increase in trade payable related to our product
acquisitions. The increase was offset, in part, primarily by higher inventories and trade receivables as a
result of our growth.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by A43,309 thousand, or 80.1%, from A54,070 thousand for
the year ended December 31, 2016 to A97,379 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues due to acquisitions, in particular the acquisitions of
Xenical�, Dilatrend� and Anexate�. The increase was offset, in part, primarily by higher inventories and
trade receivables as a result of our growth.

_Cash flow from investing activities_

Cash flow from investing activities decreased by A49,586 thousand, or 9.9%, from a net cash outflow of
A493,962 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to a net cash outflow of
A453,015 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable
to a decrease in cash outflows for the acquisition of intangible assets, which decreased from
A493,070 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to A449,482 thousand for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 and related mainly to the acquisitions of Visudyne� in 2018 and Losec�
in 2019.

Cash flow from investing activities increased by A331,829 thousand from a net cash outflow of
A135,095 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a net cash outflow of A466,924 thousand for
the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash outflow was primarily attributable to the
increase in acquisition of intangible assets, which increased from A128,104 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to A489,767 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 and related mainly to the
acquisitions of Atacand�, Visudyne� and Fungizone�.

Cash flow from investing activities improved by A91,030 thousand, or 40.3%, from a net cash outflow of
A226,125 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 to a net cash outflow of A135,095 thousand for
the year ended December 31, 2017. The change was primarily attributable to lower cash outflows for the
acquisition of intangible assets, or new products, which decreased from A224,441 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to A128,104 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

Cash flow from financing activities decreased by A167,226 thousand, or 40.2% from A416,476 thousand for
the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to A249,250 thousand for the nine months ended
September 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of cash proceeds from financial
debt raised and an increase in cash payments for repayment of financial debts. In addition, interest paid
decreased.

Cash flow from financing activities increased by A366,511 thousand from A46,132 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to A412,643 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was
primarily attributable to the increase in cash proceeds from financial debts incurred, from
A178,842 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 to A1,260,740 thousand for the year ended
December 31, 2018 and related to the refinancing of existing financial liabilities in July 2018 and the
subsequent upsizings of the Revolving Credit Facility later that month and the Term Loan Facilities in
November 2018 by A60 million and A300 million, respectively.

Cash flow from financing activities decreased by A141,912 thousand from A188,044 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to A46,132 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was
primarily attributable to the lower amount of cash proceeds of financial debts incurred as was partially
offset by an increase in cash payments for repayment of financial debts. In November 2017, we entered
into an interim financing arrangement in the amount of A100 million to repay, in part, our then existing

syndicated loans and to acquire further licenses in early 2018. We received A50 million of the interim
financing in late December 2017 and the remainder in early January 2018. For additional information, see

We define net working capital as inventories plus trade receivables less trade payables. Our net working
capital is mainly influenced by inventory levels and trade receivables. Both items have historically increased
in line with net sales development and the acquisitions of new products.

We generally maintain a stock of drugs for at least a three-month delivery period, which we believe is
customary for our industry. Payment terms vary by country (e.g. 30 days in Germany and up to 150 days in
Italy). As of September 30, 2019, 76.6% of trade receivables were not overdue. We have not experienced
any material defaults on payments in recent years.

Net working capital as of September 30, 2019 amounted to A176,009 thousand compared to
A148,428 thousand as of December 31, 2018. This increase is mainly attributable to an increase in
inventories from A79,241 thousand as of December 31, 2018 to A98,612 thousand as of September 30, 2019,
which primarily related to an increase in raw materials, consumables and supplies as a result of our
acquisitions as well as a new process for the TSA phase of Atacand� pursuant to which we finance the
products during the TSA phase).

Net working capital as of December 31, 2018 amounted to A148,428 thousand compared to
A75,116 thousand as of December 31, 2017. An increase in trade receivables was the main driver of this
change. The increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in stock of Deursil� to accommodate
higher than expected sales in 2018 and the assumption of remaining inventory related to acquisitions made
in 2018. The increase in trade receivables was due to receivables invoiced to pharmaceutical companies for
invoiced net profit and transfer amounts under TSA and the sale of the marketing authorization for
Anexate� in Japan. The increase of trade payables was primarily due to the significant increase of the trade
payables in Germany.

72


-----

Net working capital as of December 31, 2017 amounted to A75,116 thousand compared to
A40,017 thousand as of December 31, 2016. This increase is mainly attributable to the increases in
inventories and receivables due to the growth in our business following the acquisitions of Xenical in
September 2016 and Dilatrend� in January 2017 as well as a strategic build-up of stocks in cattle bile (raw
material used for the production of Deursil�) due to periods of limited supply in previous years. The
increase in trade receivables was also driven by the acquisitions and the first-time recognition of the
respective net working capital.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the purchase of marketing authorizations and trademarks. We
define capital expenditures as the sum of additions to intangible assets and additions to property, plant and
equipment, including additions from acquisitions. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were A226,115 thousand,
A130,621 thousand, A511,424 thousand and A261,194 thousand, respectively.

Capital expenditures in 2016 primarily related to the acquisitions of Anexate� and Vesanoid� Japan as well
as the anti-obesity product Xenical�.

Capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to the acquisition of Dilatrend�.

Capital expenditures in 2018 primarily related to the acquisitions of Atacand�, Visudyne� and Fungizone�.

Capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily related to the acquisitions of
Losec� and Seroquel�. In addition, we completed the acquisition of Dormicum� and Lexotan� (from
Roche) in January 2019.

**_Contractual Obligations_**

Our rental agreements and lease obligations relate to business premises, vehicles and other assets (mainly
SAP software and machinery). The leases are classified as operating leases. There are no purchase options
at the end of the lease terms, except for the leases related to machinery. The rental agreements do not
provide for price adjustment clauses or extension options.

The table below sets forth the future rental and leasing payments for the periods indicated, as of
December 31, 2018:

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to approximately A20 million in guarantees for tax refunds
in Italy, which need to be provided on the amount of A5 million per annum for a minimum term of four
years.

Except as described above, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are
reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or
capital resources.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures on Financial Risk**

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We are generally exposed to market price risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
These may result in negative effects on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial
performance. Our major transactions are performed in the eurozone. Consequently, there are currency
risks between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Since our U.S. subsidiary predominantly perform its activities

73


-----

in its functional currency, the exchange risk of the Group from its normal operating activities and from
translation of foreign sets of financial statements is deemed to be low.

In addition, we also have transactions in other foreign currencies, namely in CHF and GBP. Management
regularly monitors the potential currency risks and, if necessary, takes active hedging measures in order to
minimize risks. The resulting residual currency risk is generally deemed by management to be insignificant
on account of the low volumes of the corresponding assets and liabilities.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily results from financial liabilities which accrue variable interest
on the basis of EURIBOR. Had the market interest rate level as at December 31, 2018 been 50 base points
higher, earnings would have been A659 thousand lower (December 31, 2017: A1,179 thousand). This
hypothetical effect on earnings is due to the potential effects of variable-interest liabilities and from
derivative financial instruments measured at fair value. Since all financial instruments are measured in
profit and loss, there are no direct effects on comprehensive income. The decrease in the amount in
comparison with the prior year is due to the restructured financing in July 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, we had interest rate cap and swap transactions with selected syndicated banks in
the amount of A557.8 million (A176.9 million as of December 31, 2017). For additional information, see
Note 20 of our 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Default Risk_**

Default risk is the risk of a loss for the Group if a contracting party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Our default risks primarily relate to trade receivables, which arise from ordinary business activities and
predominantly relate to small to medium-sized entities.

We only enter into business relationships with creditworthy contract partners and, if necessary, only if
collaterals are furnished or prepayments are made in order to mitigate the risks of a loss from counterparty
failure. Before a business relationship is established, the respective credit quality of the potential customer
is assessed.

Uncollected receivables are nevertheless continuously monitored; furthermore, we have established an
active dunning system and allowances are recorded when necessary. As part of a regular analysis of
receivables portfolios, no significant change in the default risk was established in 2019. There are no major
default risks of specific contracting parties or of a group of contracting parties with similar features. Our
maximum default risk is reflected by the carrying amounts of the financial assets recognized in the balance
sheet.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill current or future obligations if we do not have sufficient
funds available to meet such obligations at the time they become due. To manage liquidity risk and ensure
that the Group is able to meet its payments when due and remain flexible in financial terms, a cash reserve
in the form of cash and credit lines is maintained. In addition, the Group’s liquidity is continuously
monitored by means of liquidity forecasts.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Our preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make assumptions,
undertake estimates and exercise judgment that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the
balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the fiscal period. See Note 6
of the 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. All assumptions, expectations and forecasts used
as a basis for certain estimates within the Consolidated Financial Statements represent good-faith
assessments of our future performance for which management believes there is a reasonable basis.
Estimates and judgments used in the determination of reported results are continuously evaluated.

Assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

74


-----

**_Intangible assets_**

In acquiring drug licenses, we determine the useful life of these intangible assets according to criteria such
as market share, possible market entry of potential competitors, legal and country risks, as well as revenue
and sales budgeted for the respective product. Judgments are generally made by management in
determining the useful life.

Intangible assets are capitalized at cost if it is probable that the use of the asset is related to a future
economic benefit and the costs of the asset can be reliably determined. Borrowing costs are regularly
capitalized only if they relate to the acquisition or production of a qualified asset.

The assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 2 to 15 years. The
underlying useful lives correspond to the useful lives expected at Group level. The appropriateness of the
useful lives and the carrying amount are reviewed at annual intervals. Necessary changes in estimates are
proactively taken into account.

**_Goodwill_**

The impairment test of goodwill is based on forward-looking assumptions. These tests are performed by
management annually and additionally on occasions which indicate that goodwill might have been
impaired. The determination of the value in use of the cash-generating unit includes definitions and
estimates in respect of the forecast and discounting of future cash flows. Although management anticipates
that the assumptions underlying the calculation of the realizable amount are appropriate, potential
unforeseeable changes in these assumptions, for instance a reduction in EBITDA margins, a rise in cost of
capital or a decrease in the long-term growth rate, may lead to an impairment loss which could sustainably
influence the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance.

Estimates are based on empirical data and other assumptions which are deemed to be appropriate under
the given circumstances. They are continuously verified, but may deviate from actual values. All
assumptions and estimates are based on circumstances and assessments at the reporting date. For
additional information on our goodwill, see Note 16 of our 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**INDUSTRY**

**Global Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry Overview**

Healthcare expenditure represents an important and growing proportion of global gross domestic product:
on a global level, the value of expenditure on healthcare represents around 10% of gross domestic product,
with $7.5 trillion spent on healthcare in 2016 (source: World Health Organisation 2018). A significant
component of healthcare expenditure is pharmaceutical spending, which on a global level reached $1.2
trillion in 2018, and which is expected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2023, representing a CAGR of 3-6%
(source: The Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023. IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science.
_Jan 2019). The significant attention placed on healthcare has encouraged investment in research and the_
development of innovative medicines and the creation of new and more efficient healthcare assistance
models to maximize benefits for patients as well as a growing utilization of technology. In more
industrialized countries, there has been a steady growth of global healthcare expenditure due to ageing of
the population, availability of new treatments, which is set to continue; while in emerging countries, where
access to medical care is progressively expanding as economies develop and more resources are invested in
healthcare, there is significant growth in the demand for medicines, especially in primary care.

The United States is the largest pharmaceutical market globally, contributing 40% to total pharmaceutical
sales in 2018. Europe is the second largest market with Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and
Italy (the ‘‘EU5’’) contributing 15% to total pharmaceutical sales in the same period. Japan is the third
largest pharmaceutical market contributing 7% to total pharmaceutical sales in the same period. China
and the rest of the world (‘‘RoW’’) market contributed 38% of pharmaceutical sales in the same period
(source: The Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023. IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science.
_Jan 2019)._

**Product types**

The pharmaceutical industry is comprised of a range of product types including patent-protected branded
prescription drugs, generic prescription drugs, Over-The-Counter (‘‘OTC’’) products. Patent-protected
branded prescription drugs include both chemical pharmaceutical products and biologics. Generic
prescription drugs include simple generics, branded generics, specialty generics and biosimilars.

**_Branded Prescription Drugs_**

Patent-protected branded prescription drugs are typically a result of pharmaceutical innovation and R&D,
but in some instances can also be reformulations of existing pharmaceutical compounds. They typically
require significant investments and a long development time before being able to demonstrate safety and
efficacy which makes them suitable to be commercialized. These innovative and novel compounds benefit
from patent protection which allows for exclusivity on marketing of the product to make the significant
R&D investment attractive to businesses. Patent protection is typically provided for a 20-year period, and
given the patent is typically filed when the compound is still in early stage of development, the remaining
patent life once the drug is launched is typically approximately 10-12 years, providing innovators with their
main bulk of returns. These drugs are marketed under branded names and can be either chemical
pharmaceuticals, which are chemically synthesized ‘‘small’’ molecules, or biologics, which are large
complex molecules typically extracted from a variety of natural sources (human, animal or microorganism).
Examples of biologics include vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies and cell therapies. Upon
the expiry of the patent protection period, these products become ‘‘unprotected’’ from competition but
typically continue to be sold as unpatented branded originator drugs. Based on brand attractiveness and
market conditions, a number of ‘‘generics’’ (explained in the sub-chapter below) can enter the market and
compete with the unpatented branded originator drugs, leading to lower drug prices.

**_Generic Prescription Drugs_**

Generic drugs are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of small molecules reference branded
prescription drugs, typically sold under their generic chemical names and have prices below those of their
branded drug equivalent. These drugs can be introduced into the market once patents and regulatory
exclusivity have expired on the originator branded prescription drug, and are generally required to meet
similar governmental standards on manufacturing, safety and efficacy as their branded name equivalent
and also must generally receive regulatory approval prior to their sale. They are nonetheless not typically
required to be demonstrating safety and efficacy through the same clinical development route as long as
the active principle is the exact copy of the original chemical molecule, and can be typically commercialized

76


-----

upon evidence of bioequivalence to the originator product. Generic prescription drugs can come in an
unbranded form as well as branded. Plain generic drugs are marketed and sold using only the generic
chemical name (International Non-proprietary Name (‘‘INN’’)), whereas branded generic drugs are
marketed under a specific brand name that can be different from the brand name of the original product
(the original branded product is also a branded generic once its exclusivity expires). Governments, in an
effort to control rising healthcare costs, are increasingly mandating the use of generic drugs instead of the
more expensive branded equivalents as they often provide similar benefits. The generic version of a
biologic prescription branded drug is called biosimilar, and given the complex production process of
biologics, its development requirements are higher than the small molecules generics, and include at least
one clinical trial to demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy with the originating biologic.

**_Over-the-counter drugs_**

Over-the-counter (OTC) or non-prescription medicines can be purchased by a consumer without the
supervision of a health care professional such as a physician and without a prescription. OTC drugs are
typically tried and tested products which have been on the market for many years and are not typically
protected by patents but rely on brands to differentiate themselves. There are very few truly global OTC
brands, which results in a prevalence of local market leaders: local brands have thus the potential to be
successful in niche markets.

**Industry dynamics and drivers**

There are a number of fundamental characteristics and trends that have historically affected, and which we
believe will continue to affect, the growth of the broader pharmaceutical industry over the medium to
long-term. These include:

1. Non-cyclical industry driven by secular growth trends

2. Rising medical needs deriving from ageing populations including growing number of chronically ill or
multi-morbid patients

3. Stronger demand for innovative products and therapies, leading to investment in scientific innovation,
advances in medical technology, and the subsequent introduction of new products and treatment
regimens addressing previously unmet medical needs and providing enhanced treatment options for
existing patients

4. Expansion in availability of basic healthcare provision/services and increasing national income in
emerging markets

5. Growing health consciousness and disease awareness, which increase the demand for healthcare
services and facilities

6. Increasing focus in developed markets on pharmaceutical cost-containment, given budgetary
pressures

7. Pharmaceutical products, in particular generics, are increasingly providing cost-effective healthcare
spend alternatives

**_Healthcare is a resilient industry supported by secular growth trends_**

The pharmaceutical market is resilient and largely non-cyclical. Spending on prescription and OTC drugs
is non-discretionary in nature and has historically increased throughout a variety of cyclical periods. This is
exemplified across Europe, where there has been continued growth in healthcare expenditure in the recent
past, with a similar trend expected going forward, driven by the broader sector drivers.

for healthcare, since older individuals have a more consistent and broader variety of healthcare needs and
generally consume a greater proportion of healthcare spending and pharmaceutical products compared to
younger people, particularly for the treatment of chronic diseases. Members of this age group are generally
more loyal to specific established pharmaceutical products, given their prolonged use.

Increased healthcare expenditure is also linked to the increasing prevalence of lifestyle associated diseases.
These are defined as diseases associated with the lifestyle choices of the person. In the developed markets,
an increase in the consumption of unhealthy foods combined with a general trend towards a more
sedentary lifestyle has led to an increase in ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, high
blood pressure and obesity. This has led to an increased demand for pharmaceutical products designed to
treat and prevent these conditions and associated chronic diseases and morbidity.

**_Stronger demand for innovative products and therapies, leading to investment in scientific innovation and the_**
**_subsequent introduction of new products and treatment regimen addressing previously unmet medical needs_**
**_and providing enhanced treatment options for existing patients_**

New medicines are expected to transform patient care in connection with a large number of diseases,
including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as oncology, immunology and central nervous
system disorders, requiring increasing amounts of R&D expenditures. According to the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, the pharmaceutical industry invested more than
A35.3 billion in R&D in Europe in 2017, compared to A17.8 billion in 2000, representing an increase of
approximately two times. Following the pharmaceutical life cycle, innovative products will inevitably lose
patent protection, becoming mature products and allowing for the introduction of generic drugs.


**_Emerging markets have seen a significant growth in healthcare expenditure driven by expansion in availability_**
**_of basic healthcare provision and increasing national income_**

According to IQVIA, emerging markets are expected to account for a large portion of overall
pharmaceutical spending growth in the coming years. Emerging markets China, Brazil, Russia, India and
other developing countries (with per capita income below $30,000 and a five year aggregate
pharmaceutical growth over $1 billion as per IQVIA classification) have grown at a 9.3% CAGR in global
medicine spending between 2014 and 2018 and are expected to drive further global growth. China is the
largest emerging market, with $137 billion in sales in 2018 and is expected to grow at approximately 3-6%
from 2019 to 2023 (source: _The Global Use of Medicine in 2019 and Outlook to 2023. IQVIA Institute for_
_Human Data Science. Jan 2019). Overall economic activity in emerging markets is expected to grow in line_
with rising disposable incomes, rising life expectancy and increased access to medical care. Compared to
more mature markets, emerging markets tend to have a larger proportion of branded originator and
generics products and have health care systems that promote higher levels of ‘‘out-of-pocket’’ spending by
the consumer.

**_Growing health consciousness and disease awareness, which increases the demand for healthcare services and_**
**_facilities_**


In Western markets, with the onset of several lifestyle diseases and lack of affordable late stage care,
people are becoming increasingly health conscious which is resulting in a shift towards preventive and
primary care solutions. The application of technology to the healthcare space is providing consumers with
greater access to personal healthcare data though wearable diagnostics, self-diagnostic kits etc. Patients are
increasingly able to track health indicators, identify early stage symptoms and take precautions accordingly,
leading to an increased demand for OTC products and healthcare services via regular check-ups and
out-patient care.

Government austerity measures, especially in the Eurozone, are resulting in the tightening of
reimbursement policies and increasing pressure on the price pharmaceutical companies can charge for
their products. Furthermore, reductions in overall health care spending by governments has led to an
increased focus on cost effective alternatives, including generic prescription products. Governments, are
increasingly mandating the use of generic drugs instead of the more expensive branded equivalents as they
often provide similar benefits. Once a generic version of an original branded product enters the market,
governments may also limit the reimbursement of the product to the price of the generic drug in order to
generate savings.

**_Pharmaceutical products, in particular generics, are increasingly providing cost-effective healthcare spend_**
**_alternatives_**

There has been an increasing trend to promote affordable healthcare due to increasing pressure on
healthcare systems. Compared to other healthcare measures such as hospitalization and surgery,
pharmaceutical products contribute a relatively small share to total healthcare spending, representing an
average of 16.3% of total healthcare cost of OECD countries for 2018 (source: _OECD Health Statistics_
_2019). Thus they remain a cost-effective measure for healthcare payers for the management of diseases._
Affordable healthcare promotes the use of generic and low cost off-patent drugs versus high cost
innovative drugs, wherever possible. Furthermore, greater engagement with large pharmaceutical
companies around pricing is helping to rebalance the price dynamics with favorable pricing provided to
demonstrable innovation and improvement in patient outcomes.

**Industry Structure**

The broader global pharmaceutical industry can be grouped into five categories of players depending on
their business model and product focus, each addressing different market segments as described below:

**_Integrated Global Pharmaceutical Companies_**

Integrated global pharmaceutical companies are typically global companies that are involved in all aspects
of the pharmaceutical value chain from early stage compound discovery, research and development to the
sale and marketing of the pharmaceutical product. The high failure rates and costs associated with
discovering and developing a compound in the laboratory through to successful commercialization, leads
most global pharmaceutical companies to focus their efforts on the development and commercialization of
a limited number of drugs with blockbuster potential so as to achieve a level of profitability in line with the
company strategy. Many of these companies might also have a focus on non-prescription products such as
OTC and consumer health (although less and less). Examples of integrated, global pharmaceutical
companies include AstraZeneca, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., Sanofi, Novartis, Roche, Bayer,
Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson.

**_Specialty Pharmaceutical Companies_**

Specialty pharmaceutical companies are typically small to medium-sized companies focused either on
specific geographies or therapeutic areas. Geographically-focused pharmaceutical companies focus
primarily on the marketing and distribution of drugs within selected regions where they have developed a
strong sales force presence. These companies often have broad product portfolios and strong national or
regional distribution networks, and therefore tend to be less at risk from the failure of any single product
and, unlike global pharmaceutical companies, focus their efforts on small and medium value drugs.
Specialty therapeutic area drug-focused pharmaceutical companies instead, typically build, maintain and
market product portfolios focused on specific therapeutic areas. These companies generally seek to have a
multi-national presence in their particular product markets, and their product portfolio could include
either patented products or branded originator or generic products. Examples of specialty pharmaceutical
companies include Ipsen, Lundbeck, Almirall, Recordati, Menarini, Zambon, Chiesi and Pierre Fabre.
Cheplapharm is an example of a specialty pharmaceutical company with a niche positioning and focus
strategy as it uses a buy-and-build model by acquiring well established, off-patent, branded legacy and
niche originator pharmaceutical products from large pharmaceutical companies and brings in efficiency in
operations and sales of these products.

**_Biotechnology Companies_**

Biotechnology companies are broadly defined as businesses focusing on drug discovery and pre-clinical and
clinical-development of medicinal products, based on proprietary highly innovative technologies. They are
often engaged in product development which involves biological processes and are generally engaged in
the early stages of the value chain. Although a number of larger biotechnology companies exist, which have
built in-house sales and marketing structure after having successfully achieved market authorization for
their internally developed products, more typically biotechnology companies seek to bring their products to
market through partnerships and alliances with larger pharmaceutical companies (which have established
sales and marketing functions). Biotechnology companies are increasingly the driving force responsible for
the discovery and development of new drugs, and often incur much larger research and development
expenditure, relative to their size, in comparison to other pharmaceutical companies with a marketed
product portfolio. Examples of Biotechnology companies include Biogen, Celgene, Gilead, Amgen,
Uniqure, Exelixis and Intercept Pharmaceuticals.


**_Generic Pharmaceutical Companies_**

Generic pharmaceutical companies focus on the manufacture and sale of generics, which are the chemical
and therapeutic equivalents of reference branded prescription drugs, which are no longer patent-protected.
These companies do not typically engage in the research and development of new products and seek to
maintain profitability by focusing on low cost and high volume production. Examples of generic
pharmaceutical companies include Mylan, Teva, Sandoz (subsidiary of Novartis) and Sun Pharma.


**_Consumer Healthcare Companies_**

Consumer healthcare and OTC companies focus on the manufacture and sale of products that meet health
needs but do not require prescriptions. Despite varying definitions of consumer healthcare, it is generally
considered to be made up of any consumer good in which health related claims can be made including:
OTC medicines, personal hygiene, oral care, food and beverage, nutritional products, vitamins and
supplements, infant care products and nutraceuticals. These products are characterized by significantly
lower levels of regulation and government involvement and the products are generally not reimbursable
under government-backed healthcare schemes. The consumer healthcare market and companies are
largely brand-driven, with a correlation between profitability and the contribution of leading brands to
companies’ portfolios both globally and locally. OTC drugs account for the largest portion of the consumer
healthcare market, followed closely by vitamins and dietary supplements. Examples of Consumer
Healthcare Companies include Prestige Brands, Reckitt Benckiser and Genomma Labs.

**_Continued M&A activity within pharma supported by the disposal of non-core products_**

In the recent past, M&A activity has been robust in the pharmaceutical industry as companies have tried to
maintain revenue growth and maintain or expand margins. Innovative products developed through R&D
activities tend to be the focus of global pharmaceutical companies given the need referred to above, but as
most players have been reducing focus on internal R&D activities, these companies are regularly needing
to turn to M&A to feed their product pipeline. The same focus on innovative, more financially rewarding
products also drives regular selective divestments of off-patented mature products having sales and
margins dropping below company targets, which in turn drive M&A activity.

The divesture of off-patent products by global pharmaceutical companies is expected to continue given the
limited duration of patent protection on any given product: there are a number of products losing patent
protection in the coming years in most of global companies’ portfolios. Several large pharmaceutical
companies have a substantial proportion of their current sales at risk from patent expiry, with many of
these products expected to be disposed in the medium to long term as they would no longer support the
overall growth profile of the business.

The development of pharmaceutical products carries high risk due to the associated R&D costs.
Companies developing innovative products are provided with patent protection which in turn provides
them with exclusivity to market the innovative product, making the drug development industry attractive.
Given the high profitability of patent-protected products, large pharmaceutical companies have a strong
preference to operate in this segment. At the same time large pharmaceutical companies have been
divesting an increasing number of products to streamline their portfolio and reduce complexity. These
divestitures are often made in bundles as ‘‘package deals’’ intended to be picked up by a single acquirer, to
facilitate an efficient transaction, execution and integration process and transition services. Acquirers with
capabilities to commercialize product across therapeutic areas and geographies have a distinct advantage
over other bidders.

Upon loss of patent protection, products selling large/high volumes face competition from generics
resulting in progressive decline in prices and also volume decrease. However, the lower volume products
typically continue on solid and predictable sales levels as they face limited generic competition as a result
of being less attractive products to develop for a generics manufacturer given the limited volumes.
Although some products have limited competition, they are low volume (‘‘1’’ in the graph below) products
by nature (e.g. products for niche indications) and do not match the sales levels of high volume products
(‘‘2’’ in the graph below). These low volume products are a result of small patient populations and these
typically face lower generics entrants due to the lack of economic viability associated with development
costs required for such relatively small market opportunity.


83


-----

Companies such as Cheplapharm acquire products in both groups (high and low volume) several years post
patent expiry, with stable or slightly declining sales, low risk profile and limited competition. Therefore,
such companies do not take any R&D risk and face lower volume decline risk. Moreover, these products
often are more efficiently commercialized by companies like Cheplapharm due to them not having the
complexities of a large pharmaceutical company.

**_Pricing and Reimbursement_**


29DEC201921130711


Healthcare is a major focus of governments around the world, with health services consuming a significant
percentage of governments’ budgets. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of
reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health programs, managed
care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Pharmaceutical prices in Europe are
predominantly regulated by government controlled authorities.

The majority of European citizens obtain their healthcare benefits from state-organized programs.
Governments in European nations exert significant control over the cost of care, either through price
controls on prescription drugs, or reimbursement policies for prescription drugs sold within the country.

**Summary Overview of Selected Geographic Markets**

**_Germany_**

The pharmaceutical market in Germany recorded $42 billion in sales in 2017, of which 69% by value was
from originator brands (source: _OECD Health Statistics 2019, OECD Dataset Pharmaceutical Market,_
_EFPIA: The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures 2019). The market has a mixed structure between branded_
and unbranded prescribing, with the bulk of the retail market covered by unbranded tenders. Outside of
the tenders, a branded market exists, however pharmacists are generally forced to dispense one of the
cheapest products unless the doctor forbids substitution. In Germany, health insurance has been
compulsory since 2009. In 2017, around 89% of the population was covered by statutory health insurance
with around 11% of the population covered by private health insurance (source: _OECD Health Statistics_
_2019, OECD Dataset Social Protection). Statutory health insurance is provided by statutory healthcare_
funds (Krankenkassen). Through these funds, citizens have equal access to healthcare benefits from
healthcare professionals who are licensed and provide healthcare services within the statutory healthcare
system. For the employed, membership in the statutory health insurance system is mandatory for all
employees earning less that A60,750 per year as of 2019 (source: European Commission Employment,

Social Affairs & Inclusion). Under the Pharmaceuticals Market Reorganization Act, a revised
reimbursement system introduced in 2014 within the German statutory health insurance, the price of drugs
employing new active pharmaceutical ingredients are allowed to have their prices set by the manufacturer
for the first twelve months post-launch. At the end of twelve months, the price of drugs that demonstrate
additional benefits can be negotiated between drug manufacturers and the German federal association of
statutory health insurance funds.

**_Italy_**

The Italian pharmaceutical market recorded $26 billion in sales in 2018, of which 91% by value was from
patented drugs (source: OECD Health Statistics 2019). The market is highly brand-conscious, resulting in
a high level of usage of branded products by both doctors and patients. In Italy, the price setting of
medicines reimbursed by the National Health Service (the ‘‘Sistema Sanitario Nazionale’’) is regulated at
central level by the Italian Medicines Agency (‘‘AIFA’’), the national regulatory authority. The Italian
health care system is mostly public and the price of drugs is determined under strict Health Technology
Assessment processes. Reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products by the SSN is set through direct
negotiation between AIFA and the pharmaceutical companies. The SSN is largely funded through national
and regional taxes, supplemented by co-payments from patients for pharmaceuticals and outpatient care.
Public sources make up approximately 74% of total healthcare spending, with private spending accounting
for approximately 26%, mainly in the form of out-of-pocket expenses as of 2018 (source: _OECD Health_
_Statistics 2019). In Italy, only a small fraction of total healthcare expenditure is funded by private health_
insurance.

**_France_**

The pharmaceutical market in France recorded $36 billion in sales in 2013, of which 76% by volume was
from originator brands (source: OECD Health Statistics 2019). While the market is effectively unbranded,
with physicians increasingly writing INN prescriptions, branded prescribing remains common. France has a
social insurance system which provides near universal coverage for patients. Public funding represents 83%
of total healthcare expenses while the remaining 17% are covered by private sources. The Voluntary
Health Insurance (‘‘VHI’’) covers around 44% of private healthcare expenditure and 56% of private health
expenses represent out of pocket household spend (source: OECD Health Statistics). In an effort to contain
overall healthcare costs, the government closely controls the supply of prescription drugs in its capacity as
both regulator and the industry’s largest customer.

**_Japan_**

The pharmaceutical market in Japan recorded an estimated value of $60 billion in sales in 2017, of which
85% by value was from originator brands (source: _OECD Health Statistics 2019). The market is brand-_
conscious, resulting in a high use of branded products. Public funding accounts for 84% of total health
expenditure versus a private healthcare spending of 16% in 2017, of which 80% is covered by out-of-pocket
household expenditures and the remaining being covered by voluntary health insurance schemes. The
pharmaceutical regulatory authority of Japan is the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau of the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (‘‘MHLW’’). This is where the decision for application approval is
formally made. The drug pricing system in Japan is regulated by various health authorities such as the
Drug Pricing Organization (‘‘DPO’’), MHLW and Central Health Insurance Medical Council (‘‘Chuikyo’’).
The MHLW is the regulatory body that oversees food and drugs in Japan, which includes creating and
implementing safety standards for medical devices and drugs. The Pharmaceutical and Medical Device
Agency is an independent agency that is responsible for reviewing drug and medical device applications.
The Chuikyo, which is composed of academics, health insurers, physicians, government officials and
others, provide recommendations on pricing that the MHLW takes into consideration in reaching a final
decision.

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading specialty pharmaceuticals company headquartered in Greifswald, Germany, with an
international footprint and a broad portfolio of more than 90 products across more than ten therapeutic
areas, including cardiology, oncology and infectious diseases. We focus on acquiring well established,
off-patent, branded legacy and niche originator pharmaceutical products with predictable cash flows from
large pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies regularly seek to dispose of these products to
reduce the complexity of their product portfolio and because these products no longer fit their business
model, even if still profitable. They seek reliable and experienced buyers, such as us, to dispose of these
products given that maintaining market supply is paramount to mitigate potential reputational risk. We
have a strong track record of ensuring uninterrupted supply, and are typically able to generate additional
value from these well established, off-patent branded legacy and niche originator products by reducing
complexity and costs throughout the value chain. We achieve that due to our lean setup, including
outsourced manufacturing, as well as through our outsourced global distribution capabilities. Since our
inception in 1998, we have established relationships with more than ten different pharmaceutical
companies by acquiring their products. We believe that our track record of successful acquisitions and our
proven ability to integrate new products into our business in a timely and seamless manner make us a
preferred partner for many large pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb
and Roche.

We operate a lean business model focused on (i) selecting and acquiring suitable off-patent, branded niche
or legacy originator products or product portfolios that fit our disciplined acquisition criteria, (ii) managing
the transfer of the required approvals to market them across various countries and (iii) integrating them
into our established value chain of contract manufacturing organizations (‘‘CMOs’’) and distributors. With
no own manufacturing facilities or sales force, our asset light business model typically enables us to reduce
production as well as sales and marketing costs by outsourcing production and distribution of our products
to third parties. Our large network of CMOs allows us to choose the partner which is able to offer the
lowest production costs and best quality for a specific product or pharmaceutical form. In addition, we may
be able to achieve economies of scale and negotiate favorable terms with CMOs by bundling the
production of various products with the same CMO.

We distribute our products in more than 120 countries across six continents, predominantly through our
extensive network of distribution partners, with many of whom we have long-standing relationships. Not
maintaining our own distribution capabilities in the majority of the countries we operate in allows us to
choose local distribution partners who we believe are best suited for a specific product and to focus on the
most efficient distribution channel. At the same time, we may be able to realize efficiencies by bundling the
distribution of various products with the same distribution partner.

Given our business model and the off-patent status of our products, we do not develop products and have
no research and development (‘‘R&D’’) activities of our own. Therefore, we are not exposed to the
significant risks and upfront investments that are associated with the development of new pharmaceutical
products. In addition, given that our products have typically been on the market and off-patent for a
prolonged time, there is a very limited need to invest in product improvements, line extensions or similar
measures.

8JAN202011315651

- Shares in sales of Xenical�, Lexotan�, Cymeveme� and Visudyne� in Switzerland as well as of Atacand� in Sweden are
influenced by the geographic location of sellers under the transitional services agreements (Roche and Novartis in
Switzerland and AstraZeneca in Sweden).

As a result of this diversification, we are not dependent on a single product or geography. Our products are
used by a diverse customer base including consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, mail-order
companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as well as
public or private health insurance organizations. We estimate that our primary customer groups are
physicians, hospitals and patients paying for their products ‘out-of-pocket’. Our products typically also
benefit from a loyal customer base which has used or prescribed the product for many years and, therefore,
is less likely to switch to a different product. We believe that these ‘‘pull factors’’ are particularly
characteristic of prescription drugs, sales of which represented approximately 94% of our sales for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019 with approximately 5% being generated from the sale of OTC products.
Finally, competition for our products is often limited or well-known. Our products have typically been
off-patent for several years and the competitive landscape has settled by the time we acquire the products.
This is because generic products are typically launched immediately after patent protection for the
originator product expired. Accordingly, the sales decline for an originator product is most severe
immediately following expiry of patent protection and hence, by the time we acquire a branded originator
product, the risk of new products entering the market is relatively low, driven by non-compelling
economics for new entrants given the niche or legacy nature of the sub-segment of the pharmaceutical
industry in which we operate.

Our business has grown significantly in recent years. We have increased our revenues and EBITDA before
non-recurring items from A132.5 million and A69.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2016 to A460.6 million and A253.9 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.
During the same period, we achieved an average EBITDA before non-recurring items margin of 53.4%. In
addition, our asset light business model allowed us to realize a Cash Conversion Ratio of 64.1% for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We believe that the future growth of our business is supported by a number of favorable long-term trends.
We expect that there will continue to be attractive acquisition candidates available to us as a result of large
pharmaceutical companies reducing the complexity of their portfolio and focusing on newer patented
products. This expectation is underpinned by a substantial proportion of currently marketed
pharmaceutical products for which patent protection will expire by 2024, a trend expected to continue in
later years as ‘‘blockbuster’’ and other drugs lose patent protection, as well as the continuing trend toward
mergers & acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry, which we expect will result in the realignment of
product portfolios. At the same time, we expect that the broader pharmaceutical industry will continue to
grow in the future as a result of rising medical needs driven by a growing and ageing population, the
availability of new and innovative products addressing previously unmet medical needs, the expansion in
the awareness and availability of healthcare and increasing national income in emerging markets.

**Our Strengths**

**_Differentiated and low-risk business model given proven, mature products with a stable competitive_**
**_environment and an established customer base_**

We focus on acquiring original, well established, off-patent branded legacy and niche originator
pharmaceutical products which have been on the market for many years and for which patent protection
expired several years ago. We believe such products offer attractive opportunities with limited risk, given
the long prescription track record, well understood side effects and lower litigation risk. Such products are
also characterized by stable customer bases and visibility on revenue streams, long phase-out periods and a
strong ‘‘pull effect’’ (i.e., limited to no marketing required as brands are well established and have a high
degree of loyalty or familiarity with the prescriber or end user). We believe that these factors also reduce
the risk of new competitors entering the market for our products, given the non-compelling economics for
a new entrant, as the competitive landscape has settled and introducing a new product would entail
significant costs.

Our product portfolio comprises well established, off-patent branded ‘‘legacy’’ originator products and
‘‘niche’’ originator products, sales of which each represented approximately half of our sales for the nine
months ended September 30, 2019. Niche products benefit from limited or no competition due to the
overall limited market size and scale constraints for generic companies and are unlikely to be replaced by
new treatment alternatives. Legacy products are frequently higher volume drugs covering broader market
segments and diseases, face more competition from generic products, as compared to the competition
faced by niche products, given larger market size and earnings potential, but benefit from a strong ‘‘pull
effect’’ due to the long track record in the market as the originator product. Our products are also
predominantly prescription drugs and we believe that the ‘‘pull effect’’ is more prevalent for prescription
drugs.

Given our products’ long time in market and safety history, combined with sticky customer bases, high
brand awareness and long phase-out periods, such branded niche and legacy originator products generate
more predictable revenue and cash flows compared to new pharmaceutical products, while having limited
drug-specific downside risks, such as litigation. As we do not engage in R&D, we are neither exposed to
R&D risk nor to the upfront investments associated with R&D activities.

**_Leading position in most relevant markets and a preferred partner for global pharmaceutical companies with_**
**_the ability to execute and integrate complex product acquisitions_**

With our extensive track record of acquisitions, ability to swiftly negotiate and execute acquisitions, global
distribution partner network and knowledge of regulatory and pharmacovigilance matters, we believe we
are a preferred partner for leading global pharmaceutical companies seeking to divest off-patent
pharmaceutical products. Since 2003, when we were acquired by the Braun family and our current Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer joined the Group, we have established relationships with
more than ten different pharmaceutical companies by acquiring their products, including AstraZeneca,
GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Teva, Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb. We believe that we have particularly
strong relationships with Roche and, more recently, AstraZeneca as we have acquired multiple products or
products bundles from each of them during the last years.

These relationships are further strengthened by our ability to swiftly negotiate and execute acquisitions due
to fast decision making processes, our dedicated team of experts and our long track record. We follow a

88


-----

disciplined, standardized and proven acquisition process with acquisition criteria that have been largely
unchanged for more than 15 years. Given our lean structures and the fact that our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Scientific Officer are also our shareholders, we are in a position to evaluate and agree
acquisition opportunities quickly.

Large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focused on divesting product bundles—across product
types, therapeutic areas and geographies—instead of single product divestments. We believe that we are
one of only a few companies with the knowhow and experience necessary to execute such complex product
portfolio acquisitions in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, our global distribution network helps to
ensure ongoing product availability in existing markets, which is a central decision-making factor for sellers
seeking to minimize reputational risk from stock-out situations.

Due to these relationships and our track record of acquisitions, we believe we have been able to acquire
products with strong positions in relatively large markets, in particular through our acquisitions of
Xenical� (which we acquired in 2016), Dilatrend� (which we acquired in 2017), Atacand� (which we
acquired in 2018) and Lexotan� (which we acquired in 2019), which we estimate to have market shares in
the countries in which we distribute the relevant product of approximately 33%, 40%, 20% and 56%,
respectively in the territory in which we market the respective product.

**_Ability to integrate new products into global network and create value_**

With over 80 acquisitions spanning a time period of more than 20 years, we have an extensive track record
of integrating acquired products into our network thereby optimizing product potential and contribution
margins. We have a large team of scientific and regulatory experts, which we have continued to expand in
recent years in line with our growth. As of September 30, 2019, over 60% of our full time equivalent
employees were active in our core functions regulatory, pharmacovigilance and quality control. This team
of in-house experts manages the transfer of required marketing authorizations in a timely manner and
enables us to integrate newly acquired products into our existing network of CMOs and distributors
efficiently. We believe that this track record, combined with our strong in-house capabilities in critical core
areas, make it relatively difficult for new entrants to replicate our business model.

We generate additional value from newly acquired products through a number of key levers, typically
including reduced overhead costs (such as sales and marketing expenses) and complexity (for example
through centralized marketing authorization management), lower production costs (by outsourcing
production to CMOs), optimized manufacturing arrangements and active pricing strategies. Product cost
optimization through outsourced production by CMOs and, in turn, reduced production costs is the most
important value lever and typically accounts for most of the cost savings we are able to achieve.

Our distribution platform comprises global partners with distribution capabilities in more than 120
countries, which allows us to ensure product availability across existing markets. We are also able to realize
additional potential from our products by choosing a distributor who is best suited for a given product or
bundling the distribution of several products with the same distributor.

Our diversified revenue base helps to limit our exposure to regulatory risk in individual healthcare markets
by geography and therapeutic area. We estimate that approximately one-third of our revenues are linked to
products for which patients pay out-of-pocket. In addition, our focus on prescription pharmaceutical
products, which accounted for approximately 94% of our sales for the nine months ended September 30,
2019, provides us with good revenue visibility based on the established nature of the product in the market,
the relative stability of prescription patterns and the more limited substitution risk due to physicians’ and
patients’ familiarity with the product. Moreover, we estimate that more than half of our revenues are
generated by sales of ‘‘niche’’ products with limited or no competition in the market.

**_Asset light business model with limited capital expenditure requirements and strong cash flow generation_**

We operate an asset light business model characterized by no own manufacturing operations and no
involvement in R&D activities. In addition, we outsource a significant portion of our distribution to third
parties under long-term contracts, which allows us to maintain a low fixed cost base with limited capital
expenditure requirements beyond investments in selective acquisitions of new products.

The combination of our low fixed cost base and limited capital expenditure requirements support a
scalable business model and high EBITDA margins and cash conversion rates. In the financial years ended
December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our EBITDA margin
amounted to 52.5%, 56.2%, 58.4% and 53.9%, respectively. For the same periods, our Cash Conversion
Rate was 79.8%, 69.2%, 56.2% and 76.1%, respectively.

We also believe that our business model is scalable and able to generate significant economies of scale. The
complexity of integrating and managing new products is primarily driven by the number of marketing
authorizations that are required to be transferred in each country that the product is sold in and the need
to ensure uninterrupted supply rather than the sales volume of the acquired product. Our expertise,
experience and knowhow in the transfer of marketing authorizations as well as our existing global
distribution network therefore allows us to efficiently integrate new products at relatively low additional
fixed costs. Since 2016, we have successfully transferred approximately 475 different marketing
authorizations to us.

We are also a family-owned company and benefit from the long-term commitment of our shareholder, the
Braun family, which include our Chief Executive Officer, Sebastian Braun, and Chief Scientific Officer,
Bianca Juha, who have consistently supported our growth through the reinvestment of retained earnings in
the business in lieu of dividends. They are complemented by our Chief Operating Officer, Edeltraud Lafer,
who has nearly 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry, and our Chief Financial Officer, Jens
Rothstein, who has served in that role since 2012.

**Our Strategy**

**_Pursue selective growth opportunities through disciplined acquisitions and continue to strengthen our existing_**
**_integration platform_**

We intend to continue to grow our business through disciplined and selective acquisitions of well
established, off-patent branded niche and legacy originator pharmaceutical products in line with our
time-tested acquisition strategy. As a result of upcoming patent expiries for a considerable amount of
products, we expect to continue to find ample opportunities for acquisitions of new products in the
medium term. We will continue to leverage our regulatory and pharmacovigilance expertise to identify new
products with predictable revenues as well as limited risks and competition. In addition, we remain focused
on products with potential for production cost optimization and contribution margin improvement.

Our acquisition strategy includes key criteria such as:

- **Valuation: Less than 3.5 times annual sales;**

- **Remaining economic life: Products which we do not believe will be replaced and will remain**
economically viable for more than ten years;

- **Return on Investment: We target an EBITDA margin of more than 50% with the aim to recover our**
investment within between 4 to 5.5 years (on an EBITDA basis and without taking into account
potential improvements from complexity and cost reduction or other key value levers);

- **Presence of the pull effect: Brands that are well established in the market and have a high degree of**
loyalty or familiarity with the end user, thereby requiring limited or no marketing efforts which are
necessary for ‘push’ products;

- **Market position: The product should have either a ‘niche’ position providing opportunity for growth or**
otherwise be available at extremely attractive prices such as legacy products;

- **Production: Should be ensured in the long-term; and**

- **Balanced product portfolio: Maintaining our diversified product portfolio by limiting the incremental**
sales contribution from each acquired product to a size which is adequate compared to the revenue of
our overall product portfolio at the time.

91


-----

In line with our expected growth, we plan to continue to enhance our product integration capabilities, in
particular by expanding our regulatory, pharmacovigilance and quality control functions. In order to
manage our expected growth more efficiently, we intend to outsource certain functions for which third
parties are better suited or utilize freelance work, as deemed appropriate.

**_Further strengthen market position and remain a partner of choice to leading pharmaceutical companies for_**
**_the acquisition of off-patent, branded legacy and niche originator products_**

We seek to maintain and strengthen our relationships with the leading global pharmaceutical companies as
we focus on expanding our market position as a leading specialty pharmaceutical company. We believe our
longstanding experience and proven track record in the industry, together with our extensive global
distribution network, make us a preferred partner to pharmaceutical companies seeking to divest
well-established, off-patent branded legacy or niche originator products. We aim to further strengthen
those relationships by maintaining our global distribution channels to ensure continued product availability
in existing markets.

In addition, our background as a family-owned business with flat hierarchies and fast decision-making
processes provides us with a competitive advantage when bidding for products and we intend to leverage
this advantage further going forward.

Moreover, we will continue to build on our expertise and track record in marketing authorization transfers
across the world to become the clear partner of choice for pharmaceutical companies focused on a global
divestment of bundles of products rather than individual products. By strengthening our relationships with
the leading global pharmaceutical companies, we believe we will be able to ensure a continuous, strong
acquisition pipeline of potential product candidates and further improve our global market position.

**_Maintain a prudent financial policy based on high cash conversion rates and supported by our shareholders’_**
**_long-term commitment_**

We intend to maintain a prudent financial policy based on high cash conversion rates and selective
acquisitions and supported by the long-term commitment of our shareholders. We target a ratio of
EBITDA after non-recurring items to Net Financial Indebtedness of 3.75x to 4.25x. We believe that our
high Cash Conversion Rate, which was 79.8%, 69.2%, 56.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017
and 2018, respectively, and 76.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, combined with the
discretionary nature of our acquisition activities, would allow us to de-lever the Group swiftly, if these
leverage ratios would temporarily be exceeded.

Our financial policy is further underpinned by the long-term commitments of our shareholders. Since its
acquisition by the Braun family in 2003, the Company has never paid a dividend to its shareholders and we
currently do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We aim to maintain adequate liquidity
at all times through our Revolving Credit Facility and significantly cash generative business model.

**Group History**

The Company was established in Freiburg, Germany in 1998 by pharma manager Kurt Teubner. The
Company’s name originates from one of the first products, Cheplaren. In 2003, Cheplapharm was acquired
by the Braun family and Sebastian F. Braun became its chief executive officer. At the time of the
acquisition, Cheplapharm’s revenue amounted to less than A1 million and it had approximately three
employees. In the following years, the Company pursued a number of significant acquisitions to achieve
growth. During the past 20 years, the Company completed a significant number of acquisitions with
well-known pharmaceutical companies acquiring more than 90 products with a cumulative acquisition
value of more than A1.8 billion.

By 2010, Cheplapharm had acquired Distraneurin� / Hemenevrin� from AstraZeneca. The Company
further diversified its portfolio with the acquisition of Vesanoid� and Rohypnol� from Roche in December
2012. The Company reinforced its European presence by acquiring products such as Deursil� / Ursolvan�
and well established OTC products from Sanofi. In the beginning of 2016, the Company acquired
Anexate� from Roche followed by acquisitions of Xenical� and Dilatrend� in 2016/17. In the beginning of
2018, the Company acquired Cymevene� (an antiviral agent) and Konakion� (a product for haemorrhagic
conditions) from Roche and Visudyne� (wet age-related macular degeneration) from Novartis. Also in
2018, the Company acquired Questran� (a cholesterol reducer) from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Atacand� (for
high blood pressure) from AstraZeneca, the acquisition of several products from Bristol-Myers Squibb,

92


-----

including Vepesid� (cancer treatment), Etopotophos� (cancer treatment) and Fungizone� (antifungal/
supportive oncology) and the acquisition of Dormicum� and Lexotan� from F. Hoffmann-La Roche. In
2019, the Company acquired Losec� (for gastroesophageal reflux disease and other diseases caused by an
excess production of stomach acid) from AstraZeneca, a portfolio of several products, including in the
therapeutic areas of oncology and incontinence from Sanofi, Seroquel� (for various mental disorders)
from AstraZeneca and a portfolio of ten products in the therapeutic areas of cardiology and intensive care
from Sanofi. See ‘‘Summary—Recent Development—Recent Acquisitions and Related Financing
_Transactions’’._

**Our Business Model**

We focus on well established, off-patent niche and legacy branded originator pharmaceutical products
which we acquire from large pharmaceutical companies and integrate into our outsourced manufacturing
supply chain and distribution network. We achieve this by acquiring products which are toward the end of
their life cycle (generally several years post patent expiry) and typically have a stable or slightly declining
revenue profile. Since we were established in 1998, we have developed a successful business model based
on a combination of in-housing and outsourcing functions, streamlined logistics and a ‘‘branded’’ strategy.
As a result, as of September 30, 2019, we had only approximately 300 employees, resulting in a revenue of
more than A1.5 million per employee for the twelve months ended September 30. 2019. We employ a
diverse network of selected external manufacturers and API suppliers such as Cenexi, Aenova Group or
Delpharm who are primarily located in Europe and with whom we often have long-standing relationships
and long-term contracts.

Our products are distributed in more than 120 countries globally. Except in Germany, Austria and France,
where we maintain our own distribution capabilities, the distribution of our products is outsourced to our
extensive network of global distribution partners. In certain cases, we also assume the distribution
agreement with the incumbent distributor upon acquiring a product. We generally enter into long-term
distribution agreements with fixed prices and, in certain cases, guaranteed minimum volumes with our
third-party distributors.

Due to our focus on off-patent products which are towards the end of their lifecycle, product marketing
and the associated costs play a smaller role compared to pharmaceutical companies which develop and
introduce new products. Our products typically benefit from a loyal customer base of physicians and
patients, which has often used or prescribed the product for many years and is therefore less likely to
switch to a different product. This effect is further emphasized by the strength of the brands of our
products. Finally, competition for our products is often limited and the risk of competitors entering the
market relatively low. This is because our products have typically been off-patent for several years and
competition from generic products has settled at the time we acquire the products driven by
non-compelling economics for new market entrants.

In addition to outsourcing the production and distribution of our products, we typically create value via
cost reductions and other value enhancement programs. This includes lowering overhead costs and
complexity associated with our products by integrating them into our lean platform, for example by
introducing a central management of all marketing authorizations for a specific product.

For example, we have successfully integrated two of our largest products, Xenical� and Dilatrend�, which
we acquired from Roche in 2016 and 2017, respectively, while at the same time increasing the gross margin
of these products. Roche divested both products because they did no longer strategically fit its portfolio
due the relatively low sales volume per country and to reduce complexity in its product portfolio. Following
completion of the acquisitions, we reduced production costs by negotiating lower packaging costs with the
incumbent CMO. We are also in the process of transferring the API supply for Xenical� to a new supplier,
which we expect will result in annual cost savings of approximately A5 million beginning in 2022. At the
same time, we realized new revenue potential by integrating the product into our existing distribution
network, through targeted marketing activities of our distributors and introducing tender management.

In certain cases, we may also realize additional revenue by moderately increasing prices for our newly
acquired products after consultation with relevant stakeholders such as health insurers and local regulatory
authorities. For example, following our acquisition of Konakion� in 2018, we successfully negotiated a
price increase with the Spanish health authorities in order to bring pricing in the Spanish market in line
with other European markets.

93


-----

From time to time, we may also exit certain geographical markets where a product is loss-making and we
do not see an opportunity to improve the profitability. However, if we exit a geographic market, we ensure
that patients can be supplied through our distribution parties in other countries. In addition, we may also
seek to increase revenue by introducing a product to new markets through our existing distribution
partners.

**Acquisition Strategy**

We have a tested, disciplined approach to product acquisitions which have been largely unchanged for the
last 15 years: We pursue product acquisitions to identify products with predictable revenues, limited risk,
low competition and an established track record. We have established the following key criteria for product
acquisitions:

- **Valuation: Less than 3.5 times annual sales;**

- **Remaining economic life: Products which we do not believe will be replaced and will remain**
economically viable for more than ten years;

- **Return on Investment: We target an EBITDA margin of more than 50% with the aim to recover our**
investment within between four to five and a half years (on an EBITDA basis and without taking into
account potential improvements from complexity and cost reduction or other key value levers) (see
‘‘—Product Portfolio—Primary Therapeutic Areas’’ and ‘‘—Recent Product Acquisitions);

- **Presence of the pull effect: Brands that are well established in the market and have a high degree of**
loyalty or familiarity with the end user, thereby requiring limited or no marketing efforts which are
necessary for ‘push’ products;

- **Market position: The product should have either a ‘niche’ position providing opportunity for growth or**
otherwise be available at extremely attractive prices such as legacy products;

- **Production: Should be ensured in the long-term; and**

- **Balanced product portfolio: Maintaining our diversified product portfolio by limiting the incremental**
sales contribution from each acquired product to a size which is adequate compared to the revenue of
our overall product portfolio at the time .

The covenants of the Senior Facilities Agreement also require us to comply with the valuation and return
on investment criteria set out above for product acquisitions above a certain materiality threshold.

**_Acquisition Process_**

We are regularly in direct contact with major pharmaceutical companies to identify potential acquisition
opportunities. We also use specialized M&A pharma consultants and healthcare investment banking firms
to help us source possible acquisition candidates.

If we decide to pursue the acquisition of a product candidate, we enter into a CDA (‘‘Confidential
**Disclosure Agreement’’) to obtain further information about the opportunity. In this phase, we perform a**
detailed commercial, competitive and scientific assessment of the product before submitting a
Non-Binding Offer (‘‘NBO’’). Thereafter, we undertake thorough due diligence to validate the initial
assessment of the product and its valuation. We employ more than 100 internal specialists that follow a
standardized process of diligence. We also validate the historical sales information for a product made
available to us by a seller by checking it against independent market data provided by industry consultants
and other third-party sources. If required, we engage external due diligence support such as international
key opinion leaders or country experts and in many cases we obtain an external validation of the
product(s). Based on the outcome of the diligence, a binding offer may be submitted followed by
negotiations. The focus of negotiations is typically on the acquisition price and mitigation of due diligence
findings. We have a dedicated internal team for negotiations but also hire specialist external healthcare
lawyers, if needed.

The complexity of the acquisition and the acquisition agreement are independent of transaction size. We
believe that, given our existing relationship and transaction experience with most major pharmaceutical
companies, transaction execution and negotiation with us is easier and smoother versus other potential
acquirers. In our experience, large pharmaceutical companies have a strong preference for seamless
execution and limited transaction risk making, which makes us a preferred acquirer.

94


-----

As a result of our strict assessment policy, we are generally able to materialize a very low proportion of the
opportunities analyzed in the initial phase. We estimate that, for every 80 - 100 contacts about potential
acquisition targets we enter into 50 - 60 CDAs of which on 15 - 20 result in a NBO. We undertake further
due diligence in respect of eight to twelve of these potential targets and submit binding offers on five to ten
of them. Historically, this process has resulted in us making approximately five acquisitions (thereof some
for multiple products as part of a package transaction) annually on average over the period from 2016 to
2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we agreed to acquire nine new products, of which three were
purchased through a package transaction from Bristol-Myers Squibb and agreed to acquired 14 further
products in the year ended December 31, 2019 through four standalone and package transactions with
AstraZeneca and Sanofi. With the exception of the Sake Portfolio, for which closing is pending, these
products are currently in the process being integrated into our business. See also ‘‘Summary—Recent
_Developments—Recent Acquisitions and Related Financing Transactions’’._

**_Integration of Acquired Products_**

The integration of new products is facilitated by our scalable business model, given the outsourced
production and distribution processes. The scale and length of the integration process is primarily driven
by the number of country registrations to be processed and not the sales volume for a specific product.
Generally, we sign Transitional Service Agreements (‘‘TSA’’) with sellers as obtaining transfer approval in
different jurisdictions is a time consuming process and for regulatory reasons we cannot start selling a
product in our own name until this process has been completed. Under the TSA, the seller continues to
operate and manage the manufacturing as well as the distribution of the relevant products in its own name
but on our account until the marketing authorization transfer (‘‘MAT’’) is complete. The TSA enables us to
realize the results of newly acquired products immediately after the closing of the transaction while also
ensuring uninterrupted supply to the customers. During the TSA phase, the seller typically continues to
manufacture and distribute the product for our account and transfers to us, on a monthly or quarterly
basis, revenue from further product sales (net of materials and, depending on the seller, distribution
expenses, discounts, rebates and other allowances) in exchange for a service fee of approximately 5-9% of
net sales. In addition, the TSA typically contains mutual cooperation obligations with respect to the
completion of the MAT as well as an obligation on the seller to supply us with stock for a period of up to
five years after signing of the TSA. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, we generated
approximately 43% of our sales from TSA related sales.

Apart from agreeing on a TSA, the most important integration steps are the agreement on a submission
strategy for the transfer of all relevant marketing authorizations and a business transfer plan within one to
three months after closing of a product acquisition. The business transfer plan sets forth specific action
items, responsibilities and deadlines for the transfer of the relevant marketing authorizations in each
country. We typically assign different priorities for the transfer of marketing authorizations in different
jurisdictions, thereby focusing on the transfer of the most relevant marketing authorizations first.

Another important part of the integration process is agreeing the ‘bridging stock’, in which we define the
amount of stock that the seller must maintain at a minimum to avoid stock-outs during the process of
transferring the marketing authorization to us and transitioning the manufacture of a product from the
seller to the CMO selected by us. Depending on the contractual terms agreed with the seller, the required
bridging stock is either defined for each local market and stored at the seller’s local subsidiary or an overall
bridging stock for all relevant jurisdictions is defined. This process typically requires three to six months
after closing, depending on the agreed clustering timelines. During the same time period, partner
negotiations with potential CMOs and distributors typically require up to three months after closing.

The period of time required for the MAT mainly depends on the jurisdiction. In certain European
countries, such as Germany or Austria, the process typically takes up to three months. In other developed
markets, the MAT typically takes up to one year and it can take up to three or more years in developing
countries. In particular, the regulatory authorities of certain jurisdictions require us to complete the MAT
in certain other markets, such as the European Union, prior to accepting an application for a MAT in their
jurisdiction.

Status as of December 2019.

Typically the acquired product is available in the Cheplapharm layout in about four to six months after
MAT.

Following completion of the MAT in all relevant jurisdictions, we purchase the remaining bridging stock
from the seller at a pre-agreed price and commence distributing the products in our own name. At the
same time, we transfer the production of the products to our CMOs.

**Product Portfolio**

We offer a diversified product portfolio covering a range of therapeutic areas and indications, with a focus
on selected pharmaceutical brands and niche products. We marketed more than 80 products with more
than 1,100 SKUs under approximately 619 marketing authorizations as of September 30, 2019. None of our
products is classified as an opioid.

The breadth of our product portfolio helps to limit our dependence on the success of any individual
therapeutic area or product. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019, sales of our top two products,
accounted for 15% and 11% of our total sales, respectively. In the same period, our top five products
collectively accounted for 51% of our total sales and our top ten products collectively accounted for 74%
of our total sales. The following graphics show our sales by therapeutic area and revenue by product for the

We estimate that our primary customer groups are physicians, hospitals and patients paying for their
products ‘out-of-pocket’. We further estimate that approximately one-third of our revenue is not directly
linked to reimbursement regulations but rather paid out-of-pocket by the patient and approximately 50%
our revenues are from products with no or limited competition.

We also distinguish between ‘‘niche’’ and ‘‘legacy’’ products within our portfolio. We define niche products
as products that serve a relatively small market and are therefore less likely to be replaced by new products
or treatment guidelines. ‘‘Niche’’ products are often recommended first line treatments for a specific
indication and are characterized by stable or slightly growing sales. Due to the small size of the addressable
market, niche products typically face no or only very limited competition. ‘‘Legacy’’ products are
characterized by a larger addressable market and typically benefit from an established brand that
underpins customer loyalty. Due to the larger size of the addressable market, our ‘legacy’ products are
typically subject to more competition (i.e., one or two products which are approved for the same
indication) and have stable or slowly decreasing revenues. All of our products have been on the market for
an extended period of time, with the oldest product being marketed for more than 100 years.

Our product portfolio spans all major product forms, including tablets, capsules, injectables, liquids,
patches, dry powders and liquids. We offer a wide spectrum of packaging sizes and various dosages and
delivery forms, including both immediate and sustained release delivery.

**_Primary therapeutic areas_**

Our product portfolio is well-diversified across a range therapeutic areas. The primary therapeutic areas
(and indications) of our product portfolio are: cardiology (cardiovascular diseases), obesity (adiposity),
infection medicine, gastroenterology (hepatobiliary disorders), ophthalmology (retinal vascular disorder),
oncology (malignant diseases), haematology (vitamin K deficiency bleeding), addiction medicine (alcohol
withdrawal), emergency medicine (antidote) and sleeping disorders (insomnia).

**_Recent product acquisitions_**

In October 2019, we agreed to acquire a portfolio of four products (the ‘‘Gold Portfolio’’), including in the
therapeutic areas of oncology and incontinence, from Sanofi for an aggregate purchase price of
A66.5 million (approximately 5.5x EBITDA multiple estimated at acquisition). The acquisition includes
marketing authorizations in certain European countries, Argentina, Canada, Japan and South Africa.
Closing of the acquisition occurred on October 30, 2019 and we are in the process of integrating the new
products into our product portfolio. The acquisition of the product portfolio from Sanofi was financed
from cash-in-hand as well as a drawdown under the Revolving Credit Facility.

In October and November 2019, respectively, we entered into two agreements to acquire Seroquel�, a
product used to treat various mental disorders, from AstraZeneca for an aggregate purchase price of
USD 213 million (approximately 5.3x EBITDA multiple estimated at acquisition for Europe and Russia
and approximately 3.7x estimated EBITDA multiple of acquisition for the United States and Canada) plus
sales-contingent payments of up to USD 67 million until 2026. The acquisitions include marketing
authorizations for Seroquel� in the United States, Europe, Canada and Russia. Closing of the acquisitions
occurred in December 2019. However, AstraZeneca has agreed to fully service Seroquel� for three years
following closing. Transfer of the relevant marketing authorizations and the integration of Seroquel� into
our manufacturing and distribution network is therefore not expected to commence prior to three years
after closing. The acquisition of Seroquel� was financed from cash-in-hand as well as a drawdown under
the USD 124 million Bridge Facility entered into in November 2019.

In November 2019, we agreed to acquire a portfolio of ten products (the ‘‘Sake Portfolio’’) in the
therapeutic areas of cardiology and intensive care from Sanofi for a provisional purchase price of
A102 million (approximately 5.3x EBITDA multiple estimated at acquisition) (the ‘‘Sake Acquisition’’).
The provisional purchase price is subject to down-ward or up-ward adjustment depending on the
development of net sales between signing and closing. In addition, we agreed to purchase the existing
inventory from Sanofi at closing. Closing of the Sake Acquisition is subject to, among other things, receipt
of merger clearance, and is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2020. We intend to finance the
Sake Acquisition from the proceeds of the offering of the Notes and cash on hand. See also ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds’’. According to IMS, the products comprising the Sake Portfolio generated the total market sales_
of approximately A119 million in our territory in 2018. According to IMS, the sales of the products
comprising the Sake Portfolio declined at a CAGR of 14.8% between 2015 and 2018.

The EBITDA multiples for the recent product acquisitions described above reflect management’s
estimates of the average based on available information at the time of acquisition and in line with the
Company’s investment criteria, including its expected return on investment period, and excluding
optimization effects.

**Manufacturing**

We outsource the production of the pharmaceutical products we sell to over 75 external manufacturers,
including manufacturers of APIs (as of September 30, 2019). Following acquisition of a new product, we
enter into a manufacturing supply and quality agreement (‘‘MSQA’’) with the seller if the product is being
manufactured by the seller itself before transferring the production to a third-party CMO. If the seller
already utilizes a third-party CMO, we assume the existing contract or enter into a new contract with the
CMO in order to ensure a smooth transition without production interruptions. The MSQA sets out the
timeline for rolling forecasts and order lead times for planning and supply purposes. Moreover, it defines
product specifications, release dates and packaging, among other things. The MSQA also establishes fixed
prices and minimum purchase quantities for generally three to five years while also stipulating that quality
control of the end product is a shared responsibility of the supplier and us. Our CMOs are primarily
located in France, Germany, Italy and other member states of the European Union as well as Switzerland.

99


-----

The diversity of our CMO network ensures that we are not dependent on any one manufacturer. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2019, our top ten products (by EBITDA generation) were sourced from
eight different CMOs. During the transitional service agreement period, we perform assessments of other
potential CMOs and active pharmaceutical ingredient (‘‘API’’) manufacturers. If there is a possibility to
achieve cost reductions without compromising quality, relationships with the new suppliers are established.
Thereafter, the new suppliers are registered in order to allow for immediate transfer of production.

We have strong expertise within the specialty-pharma business and maintain relationships with a broad
range of API manufacturers, which allows for product optimizations and further cost savings. By analyzing
the APIs (status, length of outstanding contracts, possibilities of outsourcing to lower cost production
within its existing network), we are frequently able to reduce costs and choose a CMO which is specialized
in a certain API or pharmaceutical form. By bundling production at a single site (following a regulatory
cross-check), the CMO is potentially able to achieve additional cost savings, which may in turn allow us to
negotiate better pricing with the CMO.

**Audit and Quality Control**

Because we operate in a highly regulated industry and we outsource a number of functions to third parties,
it is important that we maintain robust quality control procedures and internal and external auditing
systems to not only maintain and ensure legal and regulatory compliance by us and our third-party
contractors but also avoid regulatory enforcement and litigation. These functions are managed primarily
through our Quality Assurance and Quality Control (‘‘QA and QC’’) teams and Pharmacovigilance and
Medical & Scientific Affairs (‘‘PMSA’’) teams.

We typically enter into pharmacovigilance agreements with our local distributors or other qualified local
service providers. Under these agreements, our local distributors or other third parties act as point of
contact for questions relating to our products from local patients, physicians and other healthcare
professionals and monitor the local medical/scientific literature for us. In addition, our local partners are
responsible for receiving reports of adverse effects of our products and forwarding them to our PMSA
teams. Furthermore, our local partners are responsible for the reporting of adverse effects to local
competent authorities.

**_PMSA team_**

The PMSA teams provide medical/scientific expertise and an overview of the competitive landscape,
alternative therapies, the status of a product in medical practice across products and therapeutic areas
during the due diligence phase and is, therefore, a core function of our business. In addition, they
cooperate closely with key opinion leaders in the industry, medical guideline associations, health
authorities, third-party service providers and our membership in several expert associations allows our
PMSA teams to increase our visibility in key industry events.

The PMSA teams cover all relevant medical and compliance processes on a global basis and strives to
ensure drug safety compliance with applicable laws and regulations of the numerous countries in which we
are active. The primary activities of the PMSA teams include:

- _Contracts_ _and_ _Database_ _Management:_ administration and maintenance of our global
pharmacovigilance database while also negotiating pharmacovigilance agreements with our local
partners and handling safety data exchange agreements;

- _Global ICSR, Risk, Signal Management (‘‘Individual Case Safety Report’’): ICSR processing, reporting_
and exchange, performing medical assessments and risk management;

- _Global Safety Labelling: drafting risk management plans, aggregated safety reports and management_
of safety reference information;

- _Pharmacovigilance Quality Systems: management of inspections and audits; Individual case safety_
report reconciliation and compliance;

- _Medical Information Service: providing product-related information and management of questions and_
answers (Q&A) and frequently asked questions (FAQ) services to provide medical and scientific
support for marketing and promotion;

- _Global Literature Monitoring: routine global screening of scientific and medical databases, administers_
internal literature and study database;

100


-----

- _Pharmacovigilance Project and Interface Management: conducting due diligence with regards to_
pharmacovigilance and safety and efficacy assessments for potential new products and
pharmacovigilance management during the transition phase; and

- _Pharmacovigilance Strategy and Operations: responsibility for organization of periodic aggregated_
reports and risk management plans, performing maintenance and registrations related to EMA
telematics, management of our pharmacovigilance system master file (a document containing details
regarding the pharmacovigilance system for each of our products), and a worldwide overview of
country-specific safety-relevant requirements.

We are planning to outsource certain routine PMSA tasks such as the entry of adverse events related to
our products into the relevant databases and may increase the volume of outsourced work further in the
future.

**_QA and QC_**

Our QA and QC department ensures that our products meet the required quality standards. Its three key
responsibilities comprise:

- _Quality Projects and Supplier Management: Evaluates supplier qualification; manages transfer of_
projects and quality contracts; manages audits at the supplier companies;

- _Quality Systems: Standard operation procedure management; handling of complaints; organizational_
training; ensuring quality of products; deviation management; change control management; and

- _Batch Release and Quality Control: Ensures batch release; monitors stabilities; releasing packaging_
material and secondary packaging material and certificate management.

The QA and QC department is closely involved in the selection of CMOs and conducts periodic audits,
qualifications and controls, including through site visits. It also supports initial technical assessment of
CMOs during the selection process. All of our CMOs have the relevant quality certifications such as
certifications relating to MIA (Manufacturing and Import Authorization) or GMP (Good Manufacturing
Practices). Technical aspects of the production are implemented with the selected CMO through method
transfers and validation batches. The selected CMO is also required to enter into a quality assurance
agreement with us and is subject to regular assessments in the form of re-audits, quality performance and
supply performance measures.

Our QA and QC teams ensure that the products received from CMOs match their respective batch
records. Thereafter, they issue a certificate of analysis and a certificate of compliance that allows the
products to be released into the market. Furthermore, the teams are involved in various post-release
activities to ensure maintenance of product quality and mitigate reputational risk.

**Distribution and Marketing**

We sell our products in over 120 countries and rely on a large network of distribution partners. Our global
network makes us a preferred partner for large pharmaceutical companies because of our execution
capabilities and global presence. Our distributors are often pharmaceutical wholesalers who in turn
distribute our products to local pharmacies, physicians or hospitals. We typically rely on a single distributor
in each country in which we market our products, and in certain cases a single distributor is responsible for
several countries. However, in certain countries and/or with respect to certain of our products, we also rely
on drugstore or pharmacy chains as distributors. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our
largest distributor represented 8% of our total sales. For the same period, our ten largest distributors
represented 28% of our total sales.

Outside of Germany, France and Austria, we utilize our external distribution network or assume
agreements by assignment to market and sell our products. Our distributor partnerships are based on
distribution agreements, license agreements and consignment stocks with marketing agreements. These
agreements allow us to benefit from fixed prices and, in certain cases, include minimum purchase
quantities. Marketing is generally not necessary for products that have well-known brand names, but we
may selectively market certain product which we believe have strategic potential. In addition, some of our
distributors engage in marketing activities for a number of our products in their respective local markets. A
limited number of our distribution agreements also require us to pay marketing allowances to our
distribution partners to support their marketing activities.

101


-----

We regularly monitor and evaluate the performance of our distribution partners. We enjoy strong
relationships with our distribution partners, which provide us with local market intelligence, thereby
supporting product assessments during the acquisition phase as well as the implementation of pricing and
commercialization strategies.

In Germany, France and Austria we distribute our products through our own organization. Our customers
are mainly pharmaceutical wholesalers which place orders with our distribution center (in case of German
or Austrian customers) or our French subsidiary. Orders in Germany and Austria are fulfilled by our own
distribution center, which is located close to Greifswald. In France, we have outsourced the storage and
distribution of our products to Eurodep and Movianto, two third-party wholesalers.

**Customers**

Our products are used by a diverse customer base including consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals,
mail-order companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as
well as public or private health insurance organizations. The importance of these customer groups varies by
country. For example, Germany has a well-established tender scheme in place, such that the key purchase
decision is made by the public health insurance system. We estimate that physicians, hospitals and patients
paying for their products ‘‘out-of-pocket’’ each represent approximately one third of the customers for our
products.

**Material Contracts and Authorizations**

We are a leading company in commercializing pharmaceutical products. We are not the manufacturer of
our products; rather, we outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products to CMOs.

**_Marketing Authorizations_**

As of September 30, 2019, we held approximately 619 different marketing authorizations. We are currently
awaiting approval of an additional 103 marketing authorizations by the end of 2019, and expect
approximately further 340 MATs by the end of 2020. Additionally, planning for the transfer of the Losec�
marketing authorizations is ongoing and therefore not included in the information in the immediately
preceding sentence.

**_Transitional Services Agreements_**

In connection with the purchase of new products, we typically enter into transitional service agreements,
with the respective seller. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial and Condition and
_Results of Operations—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Transitional Service Agreements’’ for a_
description of the typical rights and obligations under our transitional service agreements.

**_Contract Manufacturing Agreements_**

Our products are manufactured by third-parties under contract manufacturing agreements. The
manufacturer can either be a CMO or, for a transitional period, the pharmaceutical company from which
we have acquired the relevant product (or one of its affiliates). If the seller has already outsourced
production, we may also assume the manufacturing agreement with the incumbent CMO.

Our contract manufacturing agreements typically provide that the product must be manufactured in
accordance with GMP and certain other technical and regulatory requirements specified in the relevant
agreement. In some cases the manufacturer is responsible for the supply of the API whereas in other cases
we procure the API supply to the manufacturer under separate agreements with an API supplier. While
our manufacturing agreements usually do not provide for minimum order requirements, we are required to
provide non-binding rolling forecasts to the manufacturer and in certain cases have agreed to compensate
the manufacturer for frustrated costs if our actual orders fall below the forecast order by more than an
agreed upon percentage.

The manufacturing contracts usually are long-term contracts with the duration of five and more years,
renewable by one year. Prices may be fixed for the term of the contract (subject to certain exceptions) or
be subject to fixed or variable periodic adjustments based on factors such as the manufacturer’s input costs.

**Employees**

The number of our employees has increased significantly in recent years from 117 full-time equivalent
employees as of December 31, 2016 to 160 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2017 and
251 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2018. As of September 30, 2019, we had 304
full-time equivalent employees, with over 60% employed in the regulatory, pharmacovigilance and quality
departments. As of the same date, approximately 54% of our employees held an academic degree. The
following table sets forth our the number of our full-time equivalent employees as of September 30, 2019:

-----

We believe that our relationships with our employees are generally good. We have not suffered any work
stoppages or strikes in recent years. In order to support our growth plans and to meet our expected
demand for additional labor in the future, we are actively branding our business as an attractive employer.
In particular, we actively target postdoctoral researchers from the local University of Greifswald and
introduce them to the working opportunities at the Group.

While we are not currently subject to mandatory bargaining agreements (Tarifvertr¨age) and collective
bargaining agreements with unions representing our employees in Germany, this may be subject to change
in the future. Our employees are also currently not represented by a works council (Betriebsrat) or other
representative bodies for employees. As German law prohibits asking employees whether they are
members of unions, we do not know how many of our employees are unionized. In general, our employees
in Germany fall within the scope of the German Dismissal Protection Act (K¨undigungsschutzgesetz), which
limits our ability to terminate individual employment relationships unilaterally. We also comply with the
German Anti-Discrimination Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) and comparable legislation in
other countries in which we operate.

**Intellectual Property**

Given that our product portfolio consists of branded legacy and niche originator products, the
maintenance and management of our trademarks is important to our business. In each market where
material sales of any of our major products are made, we register, or maintain registration of, a trademark.
In addition, we continuously register trademarks in respect of new products and renew the trademarks that
are about to expire.

As of November 2019, we owned more than 850 trademarks or trade names related to our business and
our products. Our principal trademarks include: Atacand�, Dilatrend�, Vesanoid� and Xenical�.
Furthermore, we own numerous domain names. We principally use the domain name
www.cheplapharm.com, which is owned by the Company. We also frequently own domain names which are
associated with our products in the countries in which we distribute the relevant product

Given our focus on ‘‘off-patent’’ products, patents are not material to our business and we do not depend
on patents. We are however the registered owner of a limited number of patents mainly related to
Xenical� and Dilatrend� which we do not commercialize.

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

We own several land plots adjacent to our headquarters in Greifswald. We are currently in the process of
building an extension of our current headquarters which we expect to be completed during the first quarter
of 2020. In addition, we are currently negotiating a general contractor agreement for a further extension of
our headquarters on another plot of land adjacent to our current headquarters. We also own a distribution
center located in Riems, Germany as well as the site of our former headquarters in Mesekenhagen,
Germany.

We have entered into lease agreements, relating to our current headquarters, office space and
administrative functions in Greifswald. We do not own any material equipment.

**Information Technology**

We rely on a number of IT systems to support our business operations. We have implemented applicationspecific measures, such as stable and redundantly-designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and access
protection and encryption systems as well as standardized IT infrastructure and applications. We regularly
test and update our IT systems, and employees receive regular training on information and data
protection. In addition, a business recovery plan is in place that sets forth the procedures to follow in case
of an extended outage of IT services in order to restore services to the widest extent possible in a minimum
timeframe.

In recent years, we have implemented a new SAP-based procurement systems (in 2017) as well as new
software to comply with new regulations relating to traceability and tamper proofing pharmaceutical
products (in 2018). In addition, we are planning an upgrade to our SAP-based procurement system and
currently in the process of selecting a service provider for a new pharmacovigilance database in order to be
able to better handle the increased caseload resulting from our recent growth.

**Environmental Matters**

We are subject to certain local, national and regional laws and other requirements relating to the
protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. If we do not comply
with environmental requirements that apply to our operations, regulatory agencies could seek to impose
civil, administrative and/or criminal liabilities, as well as seek to curtail our operations. Under certain
circumstances, private parties could also seek to impose civil fines or penalties for violations of
environmental laws or recover monetary damages, including those relating to property damage or personal
injury.

We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements.
We are not aware of any environmental liabilities that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on
our business. We are committed to optimizing procedures and processes to conserve resources and
minimize our impact on the environment. Furthermore, as a result of our business model, by which we
outsource production of our products, we believe we do not present any significant emissions risks.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance policies for product and general liability, business interruption, third party liability,
directors’ and officers’ and other insurance with coverage which we consider to be consistent with industry
practice. We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the nature of the risks covered and
amounts insured for our business activities. However, our insurance coverage does not cover all potential
risks associated with our business or for which we may otherwise be liable. Consequently, we cannot
guarantee that we will not suffer a loss or losses which are not covered by our insurance policies or which
may be in excess of the amount of the insurance coverage we maintain.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently
involved in any legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any threatened claims against us, which we expect to
have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

**REGULATION**

_Our business is subject to significant governmental regulation and supervised by a number of local and_
_international regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European_
_Medicines Agency. Relevant regulations are typically of a national scope; an international harmonization of_
_regulatory guidelines has not been established yet. Within the EU, however, a considerable degree of regulatory_
_harmonization exists in a number of areas relevant to our operations. In some instances, the EU has created a_
_common regulatory framework that applies in all EU member states as well as some EEA member states_
_(‘‘Member States’’), and that sometimes allows Member States to adopt more detailed and more stringent_
_regulations._

_The following provides a brief description of the main regulations that govern the activities carried out by us in_
_the EU. Although the following contains the principal information concerning such regulations that are_
_considered material by us in the context of the issue of the Notes, it is not an exhaustive account of all applicable_
_laws and regulations. References and discussions to laws, treaties, regulations and other administrative and_
_regulatory documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such laws, treaties, regulations and other_
_administrative and regulatory documents themselves. Prospective investors and/or their advisers should make_
_their own full analysis of the legislation and regulations which apply in the countries where we operate and of_
_the impact they may have on an investment in the Notes and should not rely on the content of the following_
_paragraphs only._

**Overview**

The pharmaceutical industry is extensively regulated by EU and national authorities to ensure that
medicinal products (also referred to as pharmaceutical products, pharmaceuticals, drug products or drugs)
are effective and safe for use. Various regulatory provisions establish high standards for the content,
quality, distribution and promotion of our products, as well as for routine business matters, such as
working conditions, all of which influence our cost of goods sold, as well as our personnel and general and
administrative expenses. Our current product range comprises patent-free prescription-only and
over-the-counter products for various areas such as cardiology, adiposity, infection medicine, and
gastroenterology. Our business comprises _inter alia the following regulated activities: medicinal product_
authorization, procurement of contract manufacturing, procurement of wholesale distribution and supply,
pharmacovigilance, and procurement of product promotion. Each of these activities is subject to strict
legislative frameworks at both the EU and national level. We are not involved in the research and
development of medicinal products.

The sections below summarize the material licenses and regulatory aspects of the medicinal product
regulatory regimes which are applicable to our business. The violation of any such regimes could result in:
(i) the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations; (ii) the limitation, suspension or termination of
business activities; and/or (iii) the imposition of civil, administrative and criminal penalties, including fines.

The primary emphasis of pharmaceutical regulations is to assure the safety and effectiveness of medicinal
products. Accordingly, in conducting our business, we are required to comply with various laws and
regulations, including rules implemented by regulatory agencies and by other national or supra-national
regulatory authorities as well as industry standards. These regulations contain provisions on the testing,
safety, efficacy, labeling (including warnings), approval, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and
post-marketing surveillance of medicinal products. Notable competent authorities implementing these
regulations include the European Medicines Agency.

**Marketing Authorizations**

The EU regulatory framework applicable to medicinal products is largely set out in Directive 2001/83/EC,
as amended and supplemented, and enacted into the respective national laws of the Member States.
Subject to certain narrow exemptions, Directive 2001/83/EC requires that all medicinal products must
obtain a marketing authorization before they can be lawfully placed on the market in the EU. Although we
do not apply for marketing authorizations for new medicinal products but only acquire marketing
authorizations from large pharmaceutical companies, we are still required to ensure that the acquired
marketing authorizations have been lawfully obtained and remain in force.

There are three main procedures for applying for a marketing authorization: (i) the Centralized Procedure
(operated by the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission under EC
Regulation 726/2004), (ii) the Mutual Recognition Procedure and (iii) the Decentralized Procedure, with

106


-----

both (ii) and (iii) operated by the Member State’s national authorities under the rules set out in
Directive 2001/83/EC. It is also possible to obtain a purely national, standalone authorization for products
intended for marketing in a single Member State only.

Under all the authorization procedures, the applicant must submit a dossier containing, among other
items, data demonstrating the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product. For generic and (under
certain circumstances) hybrid medicinal products there are reduced data submission requirements (no
preclinical or clinical study results are required though bioequivalence must be substantiated, usually via
appropriate bioavailability studies). For similar biological medicinal products (biosimilars) some preclinical
and/or clinical studies performed for the original reference product may not need to be reproduced as a
biosimilar application is based on a comparison of the biosimilar and its reference medicine to show there
are no significant differences between them. Besides, when an active ingredient of a medicinal product has
been used for more than ten years and its efficacy and safety have been well established, it is possible to
base the application for a marketing authorization on scientific literature. Furthermore, if an informed
consent has been obtained from a marketing authorization holder of a reference product and the applicant
has permanent access to the pharmaceutical, pre-clinical and clinical data, the data submission
requirements for the applicant are also reduced.

At the time of the grant of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product, the competent authority
must specify the classification of the product as either prescription-only or not. National laws may provide
for certain sub-categories. It is open to the marketing authorization holder to subsequently apply for an
amendment of this classification, subject to filing relevant supporting additional data.

**_The Centralized Procedure_**

Under the Centralized Procedure, applications must be made to the European Medicines Agency for an
authorization granted in the form of a single, binding European Commission decision to grant a
Community marketing authorization which is simultaneously valid in each of the Member States. The
Centralized Procedure is mandatory for, inter alia, biotechnology products, for advanced therapy medicinal
products for new active substances to treat cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS,
autoimmune diseases or other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases and for products designated as
orphan medicinal products. It is optionally available for other new chemical entities or innovative
medicinal products, or in the interest of public health. It is optionally available for other new chemical
entities or innovative medicinal products, or in the interest of public health, which may also include
applications for Community marketing authorizations for nonprescription and generic medicinal products
of nationally authorized reference products. For generic marketing authorization applications of
Community-authorized reference medicinal products (that have been authorized under the Centralized
Procedure) there is automatic access to the Centralized Procedure.

**_The Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure_**

The Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure each aim at facilitating access to the
EEA single market. Thus, a marketing authorization or an assessment in one Member State (the reference
Member State) should, in principle, be recognized by the competent authorities of the other Member
States (the concerned Member States). Under the Mutual Recognition Procedure, a marketing
authorization granted in one Member State can be recognized in other Member States whereas under the
Decentralized Procedure, a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in the EU can be
simultaneously authorized in several Member States unless there are grounds for believing that the
authorization of the medicinal product concerned may present a potential serious risk to public health.
Under each procedure, if the application is successful, the concerned Member States grant a national
marketing authorization for the medicinal product.

**_Non-EU Procedures_**

Outside the EU, the requirements as well as the procedures for placing medicinal products on the market
are regulated on a national basis and therefore differ greatly. The issuance of a product license, however, it
determined to be pivotal by the World Health Organization to any system of drug control. Thus, in most
countries, the license establishes the detailed composition and formulation of the product, the
pharmacopoeial or other officially recognized specifications of its ingredients, its clinical
interchangeability, and its packaging, shelf-life and labelling.

107

**Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing**

Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended and transposed into national law, applies substantial requirements to
the manufacturing of medicinal products, which are required to be manufactured in accordance with the
rules of Good Manufacturing Practice (‘‘GMP’’) set out in Commission Directive 2003/94/EC. Although
we do not consider ourselves a manufacturer of medicinal products, but rather a batch release site, because
we outsource all manufacturing of our products to third parties, the EU definition of manufacturing
activity includes the import, total or partial manufacture, including the processes of dividing up, packaging
and presenting of medicinal products. There are also prescriptive requirements relating to the content and
design of the packaging and labelling of medicinal products, which stipulate the information that must be
stated on the product label, packaging and patient information leaflet. We as marketing authorization
holder must ensure that our third-party manufacturers comply with such requirements. In particular, as a
batch release site, controls are necessary to ensure that the batches have been manufactured and checked
in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorization and GMP and any other relevant legal
requirements.

Manufacturers must ensure that all manufacturing operations for medicinal products subject to a
marketing authorization are carried out in accordance with the information provided in the application for
marketing authorization as accepted by the competent authorities. Any manufacturing operation or linked
operation, which is carried out under contract for the manufacturer, must be the subject of a written
contract between the manufacturer and the subcontractor which defines and allocates responsibilities of
each party and which defines, in particular, the observance of GMP to be followed by each party.
Manufacturers must monitor and review the subcontractor’s performance.

If manufacturing activity is undertaken within the EEA, a manufacturing authorization from the relevant
Member State is required which is valid for the category of products concerned and which covers the type
of manufacturing activity undertaken (e.g. import or packaging etc.). The holder of a manufacturing
authorization is obliged to comply with the principles and guidelines of GMP for medicinal products and to
use as starting materials only active substances (active ingredients), which have been manufactured in
accordance with GMP for active substances. Excipients (inactive substances) for use in medicinal products
must also be produced in accordance with appropriate GMP to be determined following a formal risk
assessment. As a matter of GMP compliance, manufacturers must verify via site audits that suppliers and
distributors of active substances are each complying with GMP and EU good distribution practice
(‘‘GDP’’) principles. Manufacturers are subject to regular inspections by competent authorities to assess
their compliance with GMP. Manufacturers must also appoint a named ‘‘qualified person’’ who is
responsible for certifying that individual batches of medicinal product satisfy the legal requirements.

Manufacturing authorizations must be issued by the Member State authority where the manufacturing
activity and plant is located and are holder and site-specific. An EU-based manufacturer may only import
active substances from outside the EEA if the active substances have been manufactured in accordance
with GMP equivalent to EU GMP for active substances and if they are accompanied by a written
confirmation from the competent authority of the exporting third country, which as regards the plant
manufacturing the exported active substance, confirms that the standards of GMP and control of the plant
are equivalent to those in the EEA. Alternatively, active substances may be imported from countries on the
white list of recognized GMP-equivalent countries operated by the Commission.

**Distribution**

Entities undertaking the wholesale distribution of medicinal products are also required to hold a wholesale
dealer’s authorization from the Member State where the distribution activity is taking place and must fulfil
specified requirements concerning suitability and adequacy of premises, installations and equipment, so as
to ensure proper conservation and distribution of the medicinal products. These requirements also extend
to staff. In particular, a distributor must have a qualified ‘responsible person’ who meets national
legislative requirements regarding qualifications.

Although we partially outsource the distribution of our products to third parties, the EU definition of
wholesale distribution covers all activities consisting of procuring, holding, supplying or exporting
medicinal products, apart from supplying medicinal products to the public. Such activities are carried out
with manufacturers or their depositories, importers, other wholesale distributors or with pharmacists and
persons authorized or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public in the Member State concerned.
We are required to ensure that our distributors comply with such requirements in the course of operating
our business.

108


-----

Distributors are subject to regular site and system inspections by competent authorities to assess the
distributor’s compliance with applicable legal requirements in the Community Code in
Directive 2001/83/EC, which include compliance with the principles of EU GDP. Distributors must keep
certain records and documentation (particularly for the purposes of facilitating product and batch recall)
and must operate a quality system and have a plan for effective implementation of recalls. Distributors are
also obligated to confirm that entities from whom they obtain supplies of medicinal product have the
appropriate authorizations and, where applicable, have complied with GDP principles. They may also only
supply to entities who possess appropriate authorizations.

**Labelling**

On the EU level, the labelling requirements are largely set forth in Title V of Directive 2001/83/EC. These
provisions determine the information that has to be displayed on the immediate packaging and, if used, on
the outer packaging of medicinal products as well as the information to be contained in the leaflet.

Since February 2019, the EU falsified medicines legislation (Directive 2011/62/EU and Commission
Delegated Regulation 2016/16/EU, amending and supplementing Directive 2001/83/EC) imposes
additional obligations on manufacturers. Its goal is to prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products into
the legal supply chain by requiring the placing of safety features consisting of an unique identifier and an
anti-tampering device on the product packaging of certain medicinal products for human use for the
purposes of allowing their identification and authentication.

**Promotion**

Directive 2001/83/EC sets out strict rules on the advertising of medicinal products.

In the EU, the concept of advertising is broadly defined and includes any form of door-to-door
information, canvassing activity or inducement designed to promote the prescription, supply, sale or
consumption of medicinal product. Advertising must not be misleading and there is a positive obligation
for the advertising to encourage the rational use of a medicinal product amongst other matters. All
promotional materials and activity must also comply with the official Summary of Product Characteristics,
which is always issued for an authorized medicinal product by the authorizing competent authority. We are
required to ensure that our distributors comply with such requirements in the course of operating our
business.

The advertising of medicines in the EU is permitted subject to certain restrictions in Directive 2001/83/EC.
For example, the advertising of unauthorized medicines is prohibited. This includes the advertising of a
medicine before a marketing authorization has been granted, as well as the advertising of an authorized
medicine for uses (i.e. therapeutic indications) outside the scope of its marketing authorization (‘‘off label
use’’). Advertising of prescription-only medicines to the general public is also prohibited, as is the provision
of samples to the public for promotional purposes. In addition, the EU legislation gives members states
certain flexibility to ensure adequate and effective monitoring of advertising and the detailed rules
regarding promotion and monitoring are consequently not fully harmonized across the EU.

**Fraud and Abuse**

Furthermore, healthcare fraud and abuse regulations enforced by the different countries may impact a
company’s medicinal products business activities. These healthcare laws and regulations vary significantly
from country to country. In essence, they aim to prevent any undue influence on the practice of prescribing
products or other procurement decisions by prohibiting the provision of improper economic benefits to
healthcare professionals and include, inter alia, anti-kick-back statutes and regulations on the advertising
and promotions of medicinal products. If a company’s operations are found to be in violation of any of
these healthcare laws and regulations, it may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties,
damages, fines, exclusion from the reimbursement programs, and the curtailment or re-structuring of its
operations.

In Germany, for example, the offering or receipt of payments or other incentives may be subject to
criminal sanctions not only with regard to physicians qualifying as a public official. In 2016, two new
criminal offences have been added to the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), which sanction, inter
_alia, discounts and kick-backs to physicians or other healthcare professionals for prescribing medicinal_
products. Besides, the Fifth Volume of the German Social Security Code (F¨unftes Sozialgesetzbuch,
‘‘SGB V’’), proscribes physicians to promise, grant, receive or offer any payment or other advantage for the

109


-----

referral of patients or diagnoses. The state rules for professional conduct of physicians (Berufsordnungen
_fur Arzte[¨]_ ) contain similar regulations. Any circumvention of the regulations is prohibited as well. Although
these regulations directly refer only to physicians, they may apply to other persons as well if they instigate
or assist physicians engaged in the behavior prohibited. Furthermore, violations of the SGB V as well as
the state rules for professional conduct of physicians may also constitute an infringement of the Unfair
Competition Act, which prohibits unfair business practices. The violation of the Unfair Competition Act,
in turn, may inter alia result in injunctive reliefs and claims for damages by competitors. Furthermore, the
violation of healthcare fraud and abuse regulations may result in the exclusion from public procurement
procedures, unless the respective company can demonstrate adequate self-cleaning measures.

Several other countries in the EU enacted sunshine-type regulations to increase the transparency of
financial relationships between the healthcare industry and providers. In principle, these regulations
prescribe transparency _inter alia with respect to certain payments and other transfers of value made to_
physicians and other healthcare professionals but vary from country-to-country.

**Pharmacovigilance**

‘‘Pharmacovigilance’’ refers to the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine-related problem. Marketing
authorization holders are subject to detailed and extensive risk management and pharmacovigilance
obligations under Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended and supplemented, and EC Regulation 726/2004, as
amended from time to time, and the associated guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices. Among
other matters, these include the implementation of risk minimization measures on a per product basis, as
applicable, as well as a requirement for the marketing authorization holder to operate a pharmacovigilance
system to monitor the safety of authorized medicinal products and to detect any change to their
risk-benefit balance. Details of the pharmacovigilance system must be set out in the pharmacovigilance
system master file, which must be maintained by the marketing authorization holder and kept available for
inspection by competent authorities upon request. The marketing authorization holder must establish and
use a ‘‘quality system’’ to perform its pharmacovigilance obligations.

Pharmacovigilance obligations on the marketing authorization holder include detailed obligations
regarding reporting. For example, a marketing authorization holder must record all suspected adverse
reactions in the EEA or in countries outside of the EEA which are brought to its attention, and report such
information via the centralized EudraVigilance database. The marketing authorization holder must also
submit periodic safety updates to the European Medicines Agency regarding the benefits and risks of the
medicinal product. Other pharmacovigilance obligations are imposed regarding the availability to the
marketing authorization holder of appropriate personnel and resources. For example, the marketing
authorization holder must have permanently and continuously at its disposal an appropriately ‘qualified
person responsible for pharmacovigilance’ who resides in the EEA.

**Sanctions for Infringement Under EU Law**

Under Commission Regulation 658/2007, as amended by Commission Regulation 488/2012, the European
Commission may directly impose financial penalties where the holder of a EU marketing authorization
granted under EC Regulation 726/2004 has intentionally or negligently breached certain obligations set out
in the EU pharmaceutical legislation. The power to impose financial penalties applies in cases where the
infringement may have significant public health implications in the EU; where it has a EU-wide dimension
by taking place or having its effects in more than one Member State; or where interests of the EU are
involved.

In the event of infringement, the European Commission may impose a fine of up to 5% of the marketing
authorization holder’s turnover in the EEA in the preceding year. If the infringement is ongoing, the
European Commission may impose periodic penalty payments per day of up to 2.5% of the marketing
authorization holder’s average daily EEA turnover in the preceding business year until such time as the
infringement is remedied. The European Commission may also impose a fine of up to 0.5% of the
marketing authorization holder’s EEA turnover in the preceding business year if the marketing
authorization holder fails to cooperate with the European Commission’s investigation of the alleged
breach. Where the non-cooperation continues, the European Commission may impose periodic penalty
payments per day of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s average daily EEA turnover in the
preceding business year until the non-cooperation is remedied.

110


-----

Penalties may also be imposed by the national authorities. The German competent authorities, for
example, in particular the Federal Institute for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut f¨ur
_Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte) and—at a regional level—the administrative authorities in the respective_
federal states have a range of enforcement powers. As well as the power to prosecute the company and/or
the individuals responsible, the competent authorities have investigatory powers enabling them to enter,
inspect, and search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent authorities can also suspend or
revoke any German marketing authorization, manufacturing authorization, wholesale dealer authorization,
thereby preventing the holder from carrying on these respective activities.

**Reimbursement of Medicinal Products**

Reimbursement of medicinal products is not harmonized within the EU but varies among the different
Member States. Thus, differences exist not only with respect to the products covered but also the amount
of reimbursement. Regulations concerning reimbursement are also subject to constant change.

Directive 89/105/EEC places obligations on Member States in respect of their regulation of the pricing of
medicinal products. These obligations include: (i) prescribed time periods in which a competent authority
must respond to an application for approval of the price / price increase of a medicinal product (where
such approval is required before the product can be marketed or the price increase implemented,
respectively); (ii) regular review of price freezes to consider whether such price freezes are justified and
prescribed time periods for announcing the results of such reviews; (iii) requirements to furnish reasons for
certain decisions; (iv) the duty to publish prescribed information and provide prescribed information to the
European Commission regarding products for which prices have been fixed and the prices which may be
charged including any price increases; and (v) time periods for communicating decisions (including
exclusions) on whether reimbursement of a medicinal product will be covered by a national health
insurance system. These obligations include communicating criteria used by national social security systems
for therapeutic classification of medicinal products as well as criteria used by competent authorities to
verify transfer pricing used by companies for active ingredients, intermediate manufactured or finished
medicinal products.

Member States are also obliged to publish information and to communicate to the European Commission
the methods and criteria they apply to define profitability, return on sales and/or return on capital,
including the ranges of target profit permitted and the maximum percentage of profit permitted to persons
placing medicinal products on the market.

**Data Protection**

The Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, ‘‘GDPR’’) is a uniform framework
laying down principles for legitimate data processing. The GDPR has direct effect in each EU Member
State, without the need for further enactment in all EU member states. Many EU Member States have
enacted national implementation acts which accompany the GDPR, such as e.g. the German Federal Data
Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, ‘‘BDSG’’). The GDPR entails strict requirements, obligations and
restrictions for the collection, storage, transfer, and further processing of personal data, in particular
(without limitation) for lawful processing, transparency, international data transfers, storage limitation,
data mapping and accountability, processor (service provider) obligations, joint controllership, notification
of data breaches and the requirement to designate a data protection officer and/or EU representative, as
applicable.

Under the GDPR, the regulatory requirements include that personal data may only be collected for
specified, explicit and legitimate purposes based on a legal ground set out in the GDPR or in local EU
Member State laws. Personal data collected may only be further processed in a manner consistent with
those purposes. Personal data must also be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation
to the purposes for which it is processed. It must be processed in a manner that ensures transparency,
fairness and appropriate security of the personal data. Personal data must not be transferred outside of the
EU unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection and must not be kept for
longer than necessary for the purposes of collection or further processing. Individuals have far-reaching
rights in relation to the processing of their personal data, such as the right to access, rectification, deletion,
restriction of processing and data portability.

With respect to the use of sensitive data relating to individuals (for example, patients’ health or medical
information, religious believes, union membership or sexual orientation), more stringent rules apply,
limiting the circumstances and the manner in which it is legally permitted to process that data and transfer

111


-----

that data outside of the EU. In particular, in order to process such data, explicit consent to the processing
(including any transfer) is usually required from the data subject (an identified or identifiable natural
person to whom the personal data relates).

Additionally, the GDPR enacts substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules and other
administrative sanctions. These sanctions depend on the nature of the infringed provision and the
concomitant circumstances and may include formal warnings, cease-and-desist orders and fines of up to
A20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the undertaking of the preceding
financial year, whichever is higher, for each infraction. Additional penalties may apply, such as the
deprivation of profits. Further adverse consequences of infringements of the GDPR may include civil
claims for material and immaterial damages of the individuals affected by the infringement. Individual EU
Member State implementation laws such as e.g. the BDSG also provide criminal sanctions for specific
violations.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

We enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates from time to time and in the
ordinary course of our business. We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the
related parties or our affiliated than they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third parties.

**Shareholder Loan Agreement with CheplaFinance 2 GmbH**

The Issuer is party to a shareholder loan agreement dated September 30, 2019 with CheplaFinance
2 GmbH in an original principal amount of A30.1 million. The shareholder loan with CheplaFinance
2 GmbH replaces a previous shareholder loan entered into with Braun Beteiligungs GmbH in 2018. The
shareholder loan is to be repaid in full on its maturity date, July 12, 2026. In connection with the offering of
the Notes, we intend to extend the maturity date of the shareholder loan to at least the first anniversary of
the maturity date of the Notes. Interest on the shareholder loan accrues at a rate of 2.9% per annum,
provided that the Issuer has the option to capitalize any interest that would otherwise become due by
giving a corresponding notice. CheplaFinance 2 GmbH’s claims under the shareholder loan are
subordinated to the claims of any other creditor of the Issuer (including holders of the Notes) in case of a
liquidation or the opening of insolvency proceedings over the Issuer.

**Spin-off of WR Group GmbH and Walter Ritter GmbH & Co. KG**

On July 25, 2019, the Issuer entered into a Spin-off and acquisition agreement with Braun
Beteiligungs GmbH. Under this agreement, the Issuer transferred the shares in WR Group GmbH and
Walter Ritter GmbH & Co. KG by the way of transformation via spin-off to Braun Beteiligungs GmbH. As
a result of the spin-off, Braun Beteiligungs GmbH became a limited partner of Walter Ritter GmbH & Co.
KG and acquired certain outstanding receivables to Cheplapharm from Walter Ritter GmbH & Co. KG in
the amount of EUR 3,565,518, while Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH ceased its limited partnership.
Also, Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH spun-off its shares in WR Group GmbH to Braun
Beteiligungs GmbH. This transfer took place with the effective date from January 1, 2019.

**Lease Agreement with Sebastian Braun**

The Issuer as lessee is party to a lease agreement with Sebastian Braun relating to a hall area and ancillary
areas immediately adjacent to the Issuer’s headquarter. We are intending to develop additional office
space in the current hall area and may enter into a new lease agreement at a higher rent with Sebastian
Braun in connection therewith.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our_
_indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the_
_underlying documents. Unless otherwise defined in this Offering Memorandum or unless the context otherwise_
_requires, terms defined in the agreements described below shall have the same meanings when used in this_
_section._

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

The Issuer as company (the ‘‘Company’’) is party to an up to A1,290.0 million facilities agreement originally
dated 6 July 2018 (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the ‘‘Senior Facilities Agreement’’)
providing for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of A310.0 million (the ‘‘Revolving Credit
**Facility’’) and a senior term loan facility in a principal amount of aggregate amount of A980.0 million (the**
‘‘Term Loan Facility’’) (the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility are collectively referred to as
the ‘‘Senior Facilities’’ for the purposes of this description).

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Term Loan Facility is fully drawn. The Term Loan
Facility matures on the date falling seven years after July 12, 2018 (the ‘‘Closing Date’’), i.e. July 12, 2025,
and all amount outstanding thereunder must be repaid in full on such date. The Revolving Credit Facility
has been and may continue to be drawn by the Company and any additional borrowers which may accede
to the Senior Facilities Agreement subject to the conditions set out therein. The Revolving Credit Facility
will mature on the date falling the date falling six years after the Closing Date, i.e. July 12, 2024. The
purpose of the Revolving Credit Facility is to finance general corporate purposes (but excluding the
refinancing of financial market instruments), permitted acquisitions and any unexpected costs or
improvements of terms incurred as a result of the syndication of the Senior Facilities. The Revolving Credit
Facility may be used for the drawing of loans in euro or by way of ancillary facilities by the relevant lenders
thereunder or an affiliate of such lenders. Any loan made available under the Revolving Credit Facility
shall (subject to the operation of customary rollover mechanics) be repaid on the last day of its interest
period and all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid on the final
maturity date.

In addition to the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility B, the Senior Facilities Agreement includes (in
addition to other permissions under the limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double
counting against the limitation on indebtedness covenant) to incur additional indebtedness (including
under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within the Senior Facilities Agreement and/or any
additional notes and/or other facilities or notes documented outside the Senior Facilities Agreement),
provided that, pro forma for the incurrence of such additional facilities: (i) if such indebtedness is secured
on the Collateral, and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement such that such liabilities rank pari passu with
the Senior Facilities, the Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) does not exceed 4.50:1; or (ii) if the indebtedness does not fall within paragraph (i), the total
net leverage coverage ratio (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) does not exceed 5.50:1, and in
each case, subject to certain other conditions being met.

**_Ancillary Facilities_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, a lender (or an affiliate of a lender) may make available an ancillary
facility by way of an overdraft credit facility, a guarantee, bonding, documentary or stand-by letter of credit
facility, a short term loan facility, a derivatives facility, a foreign exchange facility, or any other facility or
accommodation which is agreed by the Company and the relevant ancillary lender, to a borrower in place
of all or part of the respective lender’s unutilized Revolving Credit Facility commitment.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus the applicable margin. The initial
applicable margin was 4.00% per annum. The margin applicable to the Term Loan Facility is adjusted from
time to time, subject to certain conditions (including but not limited to, if no event of default has occurred
and is continuing) to a percentage rate per annum determined in accordance with a total net leverage ratio
related margin grid with a range from 3.50% per annum to 4.00% per annum. Concurrently with the
offering of the Notes, lenders in respect of the Term Loan Facility have agreed to reduce the margin to
3.50% per annum and the total net leverage ratio related margin grid shall be for a range from 3.00% per
annum to 3.50% per annum.

116


-----

The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus the applicable margin. The initial
applicable margin was 3.25% per annum. The margin applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility is
adjusted from time to time, subject to certain conditions (including, but not limited to, if no event of
default has occurred and is continuing) to a percentage rate per annum determined in accordance with a
total net leverage ratio related margin grid with a range from 2.25% per annum to 3.25% per annum.

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of any loan made under
the Senior Facilities Agreement. Default interest is 1.00% per annum higher than the interest rate that
would otherwise be applicable in respect of the unpaid amount.

We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee on the available but undrawn commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the then applicable margin for the period
commencing on the date of the first utilization of the Term Loan Facility and ending on the last day of the
availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility being the date falling one month prior to the
termination date applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (or, if earlier, the date on which the Revolving
Credit Facility is cancelled in full).

We are not required to pay any commitment fees to a lender for so long as it is a defaulting lender.

We are also required to pay certain fees to the facility agent and the Security Agent under the Facilities
Agreement.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement is guaranteed by the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor and is secured by
the same Collateral that will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantee, in each case subject to certain
limitations due to applicable corporate law and contractual provisions.

The Senior Facilities Agreement further provides that the aggregate of earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of the Company and all other Guarantors with positive EBITDA or sales
(calculated on the same basis as EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), before
reallocation of intra-group items, in each case evidenced on the basis of the financial statements of the
relevant Guarantor which were consolidated into the latest consolidated financial statements of the
Restricted Group) represents at least 80% of the aggregate EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) of the Restricted Group (before reallocation of intra-group items) determined annually on the
basis of the relevant financial statements of the members of the Restricted Group (the ‘‘Guarantor
Coverage Test’’). No breach of the Guarantor Coverage Test will occur if within the agreed accession
period, the Company procures that, subject to certain agreed security principles additional subsidiaries
become Guarantors such that if they had been Guarantors on the reference date, the Guarantor Coverage
Test would have been satisfied. The Guarantor Coverage Test will be tested (i) annually as per the end of
each fiscal year of the Company and (ii) following the closing of a material business acquisition (i.e. where
the EBITDA of the Restricted Group is increased by more than 10%). The agreed accession period
commences with the delivery of the relevant annual (in case of (i) above) financial statements or the
completion of a material business acquisition (in case of (ii) above) and its duration is 30 days for
additional Guarantors established in Germany and 60 days for additional Guarantors established in any
other jurisdiction.

**_Voluntary Cancellation and Prepayment and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Company may, if it gives the facility agent at least five business days prior written notice, cancel the
whole or, subject to a certain minimum cancellation amount, part of an available facility under the Senior
Facilities Agreement. Any such cancellation will reduce the commitments of the lenders under the affected
facility ratably.

Each borrower may voluntarily prepay all or, subject to a certain minimum repayment amount, part of a
utilization made available to it under the facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement by giving at least
five business days prior written notice to the facility agent. Amounts prepaid in respect of the facilities
under the Facilities Agreement may not be reborrowed as the relevant commitments will be irrevocably
cancelled. Any prepayment shall be made with accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, subject to
breakage costs, without premium or penalty. Any such prepayment will be shared pro rata across the
lenders under the affected facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

117


-----

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Facilities Agreement requires mandatory prepayment
and cancellation of the Revolving Credit Facility:

- with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for such lender to
perform any of its obligations, or to fund or maintain its participation in any loan made available,
under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or it becomes unlawful for any affiliate of an issuing bank for
that issuing bank to do so); and

- if a Change of Control (as defined below) has occurred, with respect to any lender that requires
prepayment within a 20 business day offer period commencing on the date of receipt of a Change of
Control notice by the facility agent. Subject to the timely exercise of its rights within such offer period,
each lender will be entitled to require each borrower to repay such lender’s participation in any
utilizations to that borrower together with accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts
accrued under the finance documents.

‘‘Change of Control’’ means (other than in relation to a permitted transaction):

(a) at any time prior to a listing:

(i) Sebastian Braun, Bianca Juha and any of their immediate family members (including their
parents, descendants and spouses) (the ‘‘Natural Persons’’), any trustee of a trust in respect of
which the primary beneficiaries comprise the Natural Persons, any other entity of which all of the
stockholders, partners, owners or other persons which own or are entitled to a membership or
ownership interest (including any profit distributions) comprise the Natural Persons or any
combination of the above (the ‘‘Original Shareholders’’) cease (directly or indirectly):

(A) to have the power (whether by way of ownership of shares, proxy, contract, agency or
otherwise) to:

(1) cast, or control the casting of, more than 50% of the maximum number of votes that
might be cast at a shareholders’ meeting of the Parent Guarantor; or

(2) appoint or remove all, or the majority, of the managing directors of the Parent
Guarantor; or

(B) hold beneficially more than 50% of the issued share capital of the Parent Guarantor; or

(ii) the Parent Guarantor ceasing to own (directly or indirectly) 100% of the issued shares in the
Company;

(b) at any time after a listing:

(i) the Original Shareholders cease to control (directly or indirectly) more than 50% of the issued
share capital of the Parent Guarantor;

(ii) any person or group of persons acting in concert (other than the Original Shareholders) holding
or controlling beneficially, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of the share capital of the Parent
Guarantor; or

(iii) the Parent Guarantor ceases to own (directly or indirectly) 100% of the issued shares in the
Company.

Following the election of any lender to have his participation in any utilizations prepaid and cancelled
following a Change of Control, such prepayment and cancellation will take place no later than 20 business
days from the date the Issuer has received the prepayment and cancellation notice from the relevant
lender.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Company must further ensure that the
borrowers prepay loans and cancel available commitments in amounts equal to certain acquisition
proceeds, disposal proceeds, insurance proceeds and flotation proceeds, to the extent applicable and
subject to further conditions.

**_Financial Covenant_**

If, on any quarter date in respect of the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters, the
aggregate of the loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (including loans made available
under ancillary facilities but excluding any amounts to fund up-front or other one-off fees, any original

118


-----

issue discount and any increased margins) exceeds 40% of the total commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility as at that date (the ‘‘Test Condition’’), the Company is required to confirm whether or not
the Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) for the period of
the most recent four consecutive financial quarters (subject to certain provisions and adjustments) exceeds
6.00:1 (the ‘‘Financial Covenant’’).

A breach of the Financial Covenant (if required to be tested) will not constitute a default if it is complied
with when tested on the next test date or the Test Condition is not met on the next test date.

The Company is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the Financial Covenant by electing to designate
the proceeds from any new equity of the Company and new shareholder loans received by the Company
after the breach of the Financial Covenant as a cure amount. The Company may not make such election
(i) more than four times during the life of the Senior Facilities Agreement, or (ii) in consecutive testing
periods. A breach of the Financial Covenant may only be cured if the relevant equity or shareholder loan is
actually received by the Company no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date on which the
relevant compliance certificate disclosing the breach was required to be delivered to the facility agent.

**_Representations_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement will contain certain representations and warranties (subject to certain
specified exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including
(i) status, (ii) binding obligations, (iii) non-conflict with other obligations, (iv) power and authority,
(v) validity and admissibility in evidence, (vi) governing law and enforcement, (vii) insolvency, (viii) no
filings and stamp taxes, (ix) no default, (x) no misleading information in relation to certain information and
documents provided to the facility agent and the other finance parties, (xi) financial statements, (xii) no

laws, (xxiii) pari passu ranking, (xiv) centre of main interest and (xxv) no deduction of tax.

Certain representations were made on the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement and will be repeated on
the date of each utilization request, the date of each utilization and on the first date of each interest
period.

**_General Undertakings_**

We are subject to certain restrictive and, as the case may be, affirmative covenants under the Senior
Facilities Agreement customary for these types of financing, which, in turn, are subject to certain specified
exceptions and qualifications (customized to our business and adjusted to our current credit standing). The
Senior Facilities Agreement will, in particular and without limitation, include restrictions and limitations
(subject to exceptions, basket and thresholds) on:

- Mergers, amalgamations, demergers, consolidations or other corporate reconstructions;

- Acquisitions;

- Investments,

- Grating security interests (negative pledge);

- Disposals;

- Making loans or credits;

- Dividends, making subordinated loans and other distributions;

- Issues of shares; and

- Treasury transactions and the entry into other derivative transactions.

In particular, the dividend covenant under the Senior Facilities Agreement, restricts our ability to declare,
make or pay any dividend, charge, fee or other distribution or make any payment in respect of any
shareholder loan or make any loan to the Company’s direct or indirect shareholders, subject to certain
exemptions which, inter alia, permit for a distribution if (y) immediately before and after giving pro forma
effect to any such distribution, no event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall have
occurred and (z) the Company’s Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Facilities

119


-----

Agreement) does not exceed a certain ratio. The acquisition covenant under the Senior Facilities
Agreement restricts our ability to acquire a company, or any shares or securities or a business or
undertaking, subject to certain exemptions and conditions which, _inter alia, permit any individual_
acquisition of up to an agreed amount subject to additional conditions under the Senior Facilities
Agreement being satisfied.

For acquisitions of additional pharmaceutical products above a certain agreed threshold, these
requirements include, among others, that:

- the purchase price does not exceed 3.5x times the revenue generated by the acquisition target during
the immediately preceding twelve months period for which financial information is available;

- based on available financial information, the purchase price divided by the expected cumulated
contribution margin of the acquisition target results in a return of investment period of less than or
equal to 5.5 years (as confirmed by an external valuation report); and

- internal due diligence and external valuation reports have been prepared.

Affirmative covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement will include, without limitation, and subject to
exceptions, basket and thresholds:

- Maintenance of authorizations;

- Compliance with laws;

- Notification of environmental claims;

- Preservation of assets;

- Maintenance of pari passu ranking;

- Arm’s length basis;

- Maintenance of insurance;

- Intellectual property;

- Sanctions, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws;

- Maintenance of credit ratings;

- Further assurance; and

- Centre of Main Interest.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain events of default that are customary for such types of
financing (subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods), including, without limitation:
(i) non-payment of amounts due under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the other finance documents,
(ii) breach of the Financial Covenant, (iii) breach of other obligations, (iv) misrepresentations, (v) cross
default or acceleration, (vi) insolvency or insolvency proceedings, (vii) creditor’s process,
(viii) unlawfulness or invalidity of the Senior Facilities Agreement or another finance document,
(ix) breach of the Intercreditor Agreement or (x) occurrence of a material adverse change. The occurrence
of any such event of default would, subject to any applicable grace periods or cure rights and agreed
exceptions, entitle the lenders to cancel their commitments, declare that all or part of the loans together
with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding under the finance documents be
immediately due and payable and declare that cash cover in respect of any outstanding amounts under the
ancillary facilities is immediately due and payable or payable on demand.

**_Governing law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it
are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The Issuer, the Security Agent, the facility agent and the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
among others, entered into an intercreditor agreement originally dated July 6, 2018 (as amended and/or

120


-----

restated from time to time, the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’) to which the Trustee will accede as a ‘‘senior
secured notes trustee’’ on or prior to the Issue Date. The Intercreditor Agreement governs, inter alia, the
relationships and relative priorities among (i) the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement; (ii) the
holders of the Notes and the Trustee; (iii) future hedge counterparties under certain hedging agreements
(the ‘‘Hedge Counterparties’’) and (iv) certain other future creditors of the Restricted Group that may
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time in accordance with its terms; (v) certain intra
group creditors and debtors; (vi) future creditor representatives; and (vii) the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms of, the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the total amount of Indebtedness under any bilateral agreements
and under any cash management agreements which are permitted to share in the Collateral, with respect
to the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral (such credit facilities, together with the Senior
Facilities, together the ‘‘Credit Facilities’’ and each a ‘‘Credit Facility’’) shall not exceed A10 million in the
case of cash management liabilities and A13 million in the case of bilateral liabilities. The following
description of certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement summarizes certain provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it
describe provisions relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such,
we urge you to read the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the general overview that follows,
defines the rights of the holders of the Notes.

**_General_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, among other things, sets out:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness and liabilities of the Debtors;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

- the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of the transaction security;

- turnover provisions; and

- when the transaction security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the collateral.

For purposes of this description, ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’ shall include the Notes and any other notes,
securities or other debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing
(as defined below) has been made available to a member of the Restricted Group which are designated by
the Issuer as ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’ under the Intercreditor Agreement. In this description, terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Issuer and each other debtor under
the Intercreditor Agreement (together, the ‘‘Debtors’’) (other than any member of the Restricted Group
which is designated as a Topco Borrower under the Intercreditor Agreement (a ‘‘Topco Borrower’’)) shall
rank in right of priority and payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any
prior ranking liabilities as follows:

**first, liabilities owed to (i) the lenders, issuing banks and ancillary lenders in relation to the Senior**
Facilities Agreement or any future senior secured facilities agreements (a ‘‘Permitted Senior Secured
**Facilities Agreement’’) (the ‘‘Credit Facilities Liabilities’’), (ii) the lenders, issuing banks, and ancillary**
lenders in relation to any future super senior facilities agreement (a ‘‘Permitted Super Senior Secured
**Facilities Agreement’’) and any hedge counterparty under a hedging agreement that is designated by the**
Parent as super senior (together the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’ and creditors thereof being the ‘‘Super
**Senior Creditors’’), (iii) the Trustee and any trustee in relation to senior secured notes issued by a member of**
the Restricted Group and designated as such by the Issuer ((the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’) (each a ‘‘Senior
**Secured Notes Trustee’’) (other than certain amounts paid to it in its capacity as trustee), the Senior Secured**
Notes and the Security Agent in relation to the Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes

121


-----

**Liabilities’’), (iv) the lender under any future loan made by the issuer of any Senior Secured Notes (if so**
designated by the Issuer in its discretion and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer) to a
member of the Restricted Group for the purposes of on lending the proceeds of any Senior Secured Notes
together with any additional or replacement loan made on substantially the same terms (the ‘‘Senior
**Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities’’), (v) the arrangers, agents and lenders under any cash**
management facility (a ‘‘Cash Management Facility’’ and the liabilities under a Cash Management Facility
being the ‘‘Cash Management Facility Liabilities’’), (vi) the hedge counterparties in relation to any
hedging agreements that are not Super Senior Liabilities (together with the hedging designated by the
Issuer as being Super Senior Liabilities, the ‘‘Hedging Liabilities’’), (vii) the arrangers, agents and lenders
under any bilateral agreements (a ‘‘Bilateral Agreement’’ and the liabilities under a Bilateral Agreement
being the ‘‘Bilateral Liabilities’’) (viii) any agent or trustee under any finance documents relating to any of
the aforementioned liabilities, any agent or trustee under the Topco Liabilities (as defined below) and to
any agent or trustee in relation to certain other unsecured liabilities (together the ‘‘Agent Liabilities’’), pari
_passu and without any preference between them and (ix) the Security Agent; and_

**second, all liabilities owed (i) to the trustee (other than certain amounts paid to it in its capacity as trustee),**
and the holders of any future notes issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing (as defined
below) has been made available to or by a Topco Borrower and designated by the Issuer as Topco Notes
and the Security Agent in relation to such Topco Notes (the ‘‘Topco Notes Liabilities’’), (ii) under any
future loan facility made available to any Topco Borrower (a ‘‘Topco Loan’’) (the ‘‘Topco Facility
**Liabilities’’ and together with the Topco Notes Liabilities, the ‘‘Topco Liabilities’’), and (iii) the liabilities**
owed under any future loan (a ‘‘Topco Proceeds Loan’’) made by the Parent or any other entity which
accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement for this purpose (a ‘‘Topco Investor’’) for the purpose of on
lending the proceeds of any Topco Notes or Topco Loans (the ‘‘Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities’’ and
together with the Topco Liabilities, the ‘‘Topco Group Liabilities’’), pari passu and without any preference
between them.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by any Topco Borrower or any of its
affiliates (other than a member of the Restricted Group) (the ‘‘Topco Independent Obligors’’) to the
Secured Parties (as defined below) shall rank pari passu in right and priority of payment and without any
preference between them in respect of (i) the Senior Lender Liabilities, (ii) the Super Senior Liabilities,
(iii) the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, (iv) the Cash Management Facility Liabilities, (v) the Hedging
Liabilities, (vi) the Bilateral Liabilities, (vii) the Topco Liabilities, (viii) the Topco Proceeds Loan
Liabilities, and (ix) the Agent Liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-group liabilities owed by one member of the
Restricted Group to another member of the Restricted Group (other than any Subordinated Liabilities (as
defined below), Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities or Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) (the
‘‘Intra-Group Liabilities’’) will be subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors and Third Party
Security Providers to the creditors under the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Bilateral Liabilities,
Agent Liabilities, Topco Liabilities and Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities (such creditors, together with the
Security Agent, any receiver or delegate, any creditor of the Agent Liabilities and any arranger with
respect to the Secured Liabilities, the ‘‘Secured Parties’’).

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the liabilities owed by any member of the Restricted
Group (other than any Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) to a holding company of the Parent or to any
other person who becomes a subordinated creditor (a ‘‘Subordinated Creditor’’) under the Intercreditor
Agreement (the ‘‘Subordinated Liabilities’’) will be subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors
and Third Party Security Providers to the Secured Parties and to the Intra-Group Liabilities.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing, guarantee or debt
arrangements for the benefit of any person (including any Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes
Proceeds Loan, any Topco Loans, any Topco Notes and any Topco Proceeds Loan) (each a ‘‘New Debt
**Financing’’). The conditions include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing is expressly**
permitted under the Senior Facilities Agreement and not prohibited under the terms of the other Finance
Documents.

122


-----

Such financing arrangements may be implemented, without limitation, by way of refinancing, replacement,
exchange, set-off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional or supplemental financing,
guarantee or debt arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to
facilitate any New Debt Financing, each Agent and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and
instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing
security document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security (as the case may be) subject to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of
such security (which shall be, unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer or otherwise required by the Issuer,
substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

**_Transaction Security_**

The Secured Parties benefit from the transaction security.

Subject to the order of application of proceeds (see ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below), the transaction
security shall rank and secure the following liabilities:

- prior to the designation date in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities, the liabilities owned to the
Security Agent, the Agent Liabilities, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, the Cash Management Liabilities, the Bilateral Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities pari
passu and without preference between them; and

- on and from the designation date in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities, first the liabilities owed to
the Security Agent, the Agent Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities and second, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Cash
Management Liabilities, the Bilateral Liabilities and the pari passu hedging liabilities in each case pari
passu and without preference between them; and

- then, to the extent of the Topco Shared Security, the Topco Liabilities pari passu and without any
preference between them.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the guarantees and transaction security will be
released in certain circumstances described further below in ‘‘—Release of Security—Non distressed
_Disposals’’ and ‘‘—Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals’’._

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and Super Senior Liabilities (together with the Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities, the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities’’, the creditors in respect thereof being the
‘‘Senior Secured Creditors’’) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Super Senior Facility
or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Notes or Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the
Restricted Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers and received
by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ and
further provided that after the designation date in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities there shall be no
obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an enforcement of
Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction
Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an event
of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the ‘‘Secured Liabilities’’) have been discharged (the ‘‘Priority
**Discharge Date’’), the Debtors may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Topco Group**

123


-----

Liabilities, in accordance with the Finance Documents governing such Topco Group Liabilities, subject to
compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions include that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured
Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no
payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Topco Group Liabilities and
no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest
or certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility document, Senior Secured Notes
document or Bilateral Agreement.

Certain specified payments in respect of Topco Liabilities may also be permitted, notwithstanding that a
payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Instructing Group_

An ‘‘Instructing Group’’ means:

(a) if the designation date in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities has not occurred:

(i) prior to the first date on which the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and the Senior Liabilities
have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Senior Secured Discharge Date’’), the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below);

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the first date on which all Topco
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharge has occurred (the ‘‘Topco Discharge Date’’), the
Majority Topco Creditors (as defined below); and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the designation date in relation to the Super Senior
Liabilities and:

(i) prior to the date on which both the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which
the Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Super Senior Discharge
**Date’’) has occurred (the ‘‘Priority Discharge Date’’), the Senior Secured Creditors (other than**
the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other
than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured Creditors’’), and the Super
Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority
**Super Senior Creditors’’) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the**
group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement
regime described under ‘‘—Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the designation date in
_relation to the Super Senior Liabilities’’ and ‘‘—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the_
_designation date in relation to the Super Senior Liabilities’’ below;_

(ii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Topco
Creditors representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Topco Creditors’’).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the designation date in relation to the Super Senior_
_Liabilities_

Prior to the designation date in relation to the Super Senior Liabilities, the Security Agent may refrain
from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise (i) by the Instructing Group, or (ii) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group have (A) given no instructions or have
instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third
Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, by a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee
(acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may
give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the
Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or
representatives of the Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the

124


-----

Transaction Security either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then
the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as
the Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the
Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event (as defined
below) or (ii) the Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group
determines in good faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such
enforcement, before giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other
enforcement action the creditors represented by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each
other agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such
enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten business days or take any
Enforcement Action (the ‘‘Consultation Period’’) and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give
the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such
Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the designation date in relation to the Super Senior_
_Liabilities_

On or after the designation date in relation to the Super Senior Liabilities, the Security Agent may refrain
from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions
described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority
Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions
they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an ‘‘Initial Enforcement Notice’’) to the Security Agent and
to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will act in accordance with any
instructions (provided they are consistent with the security enforcement principles received from (i) the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a
determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within
three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred
within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super
Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly
caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct
the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce
the Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver
instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to
enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal, an agent or trustee acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Topco
Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or indicate any
intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior
Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the
paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they
see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from
enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

125


-----

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the
selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the
Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement shall instruct
it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no
action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising
under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the
paragraphs above.

_Turnover_

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest
to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, and the first date on
which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the ‘‘Topco Discharge Date’’) (the ‘‘Final
**Discharge Date’’) any creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Restricted Group or**
Third Party Security Provider:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’;

(b) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below)); or

acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’; or

(e) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Restricted Group or Third Party Security Provider
which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ and
which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in
respect of that Debtor, member of the Restricted Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(a) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered)
on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or
distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (or if a creditor cannot hold receipts and recoveries on trust, promptly pay or

126


-----

distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement), and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any)
by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
designation date in relation to the Super Senior Liabilities but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any
creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member of the Restricted Group or Third Party
Security Provider any amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent
except in accordance with the provisions set out below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’.

‘‘Insolvency Event’’ includes, in relation to any Debtor, member of the Restricted Group or Third Party
Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making of an order made for the winding up,
dissolution, administration or reorganization, (b) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement
with any class of creditors generally (subject to certain exceptions), (c) the appointment of a liquidator,

**_Release of Security—Non Distressed Disposals_**

In circumstances where (i) a disposal is not a distressed disposal of an asset of a member of the Restricted
Group or Third Party Security Provider which is subject to the Topco Shared Security (and which is being
effected (x) in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable, (y) by enforcement
of the Transaction Security or (z) after the occurrence of a Distress Event) or (ii) any transaction pursuant

**_Amendment_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security
Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of
creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or
adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent or
trustee acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ above and the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each
of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior
Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, all of the Senior Lenders under the
Facilities Agreement, each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would
adversely affect the Hedge Counterparty) and the Security Agent.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions
or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized
to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its
capacity as such).

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions which can result in a party’s participation being deemed
zero for the purpose of calculating the percentage of necessary consents by the members of a relevant
group in regard to amendments and waivers (snooze/lose).

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits the Security Agent (subject to the terms of any Credit Facility)
to enter into new or supplemental security and/or release and retake transaction security if certain
conditions are met.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it
are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung)
organized under German law (the ‘‘Issuer’’) will issue A500.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior
secured notes due 2027 (the ‘‘Notes’’) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the
‘‘Indenture’’), among, _inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited as trustee (the_
‘‘Trustee’’), Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as security agent (the ‘‘Security Agent’’), Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch as paying agent (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’) and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as
transfer agent (in such capacity, the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’) and registrar (in such capacity, the ‘‘Registrar’’). In
this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’, the term ‘‘Issuer’’ refers to CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH only
and not to any of its Subsidiaries, and the term ‘‘Parent’’ refers to CheplaFinance 2 GmbH only and not to
any of its Subsidiaries. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended.

The following describes the material provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the
Security Documents and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and is subject, and is qualified in its entirety
by reference, to all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as
holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement are available as set forth under ‘‘Listing and General Information’’. You can find the definitions
of certain terms used in this description under the subheading ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- constitute senior obligations of the Issuer;

- rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and any hedging obligations);

- be secured by the Collateral (as defined below) along with the obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and certain other obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

- rank effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the Issuer,
to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined below) that is available to satisfy the obligations
of the Issuer under the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s existing and future secured Indebtedness that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property or assets
securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

From the Issue Date, the Notes will initially be guaranteed (the ‘‘Parent Guarantee’’) on a senior, limitedrecourse basis by the Parent and, as a result, the Parent Guarantee will be limited to the proceeds from
enforcement of the pledge over the issued share capital of the Issuer. However, the Parent will be subject
to only certain covenants under the Indenture.

The Issuer may from time to time be required to procure from certain of its Subsidiaries (each, a
‘‘Guarantor’’) the issuance of additional guarantees pursuant to the provisions set forth under
‘‘—Covenants—Future Guarantors’’ below (any such guarantee an ‘‘Additional Note Guarantee’’ and,
together with the Parent Guarantee, the ‘‘Note Guarantees’’). Any Additional Note Guarantee shall be
limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance,

preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to
reflect corporate benefit rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, laws on the capital maintenance, limitations of
corporate law or purpose, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other
limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might significantly limit the amount that can
be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, the obligations of such Guarantor
under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes or
even zero. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Notes Guarantee will be
entitled to contribution from any other Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the
rights of Holders under the Notes Guarantee.

The term ‘‘Note Guarantees’’ shall, in addition to the Parent Guarantee, also include any such Additional
Note Guarantees.

Subject to the above, the Note Guarantee of each Guarantor and the Parent will:

- constitute general senior obligations of such Guarantor and in the case of the Parent, a general senior,
limited recourse obligation;

- rank equal in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s or the Parent’s existing and future
obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Guarantee (including
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations);

- be secured by the Collateral (as defined below) along with its obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and certain other obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor or the Parent;

- effectively rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the
relevant Guarantor or the Parent, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined below) that is
available to satisfy the obligations of the relevant Guarantor or the Parent under the applicable Note
Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to such Guarantor’s or the Parent’s existing and future secured
Indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Note Guarantee of such
Guarantor or the Parent, to the extent of the value of such property or assets securing such
Indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness (including obligations to trade
creditors) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes; and

- be subject to the limitations described herein.

As of the Issue Date, none of our Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes and we may establish further
Subsidiaries in the future that will not guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the
holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Issuer. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, the Issuer (before consolidating effects)
represented 100.4% of our consolidated EBITDA and, as of September 30, 2019, the Issuer represented
100.0% of our total assets. See ‘‘Risks Factors—Risks Related to our Structure—The Notes and the Guarantee
_will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our subsidiaries’’._

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may, without the consent of the Holders, issue additional Notes (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) under
the Indenture from time to time after this offering having the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all
respects (or in all respects except for the issue date, the commencement of interest payment obligations
and/or the issue price). Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture
including the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’. Any Additional
Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be consolidated with, form a single series with and
increase the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in
this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the Notes include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are issued.

132


-----

**_Principal and Maturity_**

The Issuer will issue A500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes will
mature on February 11, 2027 (the ‘‘Maturity Date’’) at their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the Maturity Date. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Notes will accrue on their outstanding aggregate principal amount at the rate of 3.500% per
annum from and including the Issue Date to but excluding the Maturity Date and will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year commencing on August 15, 2020 to the
Holder of record of such Notes on the immediately preceding business day. The Notes shall cease to bear
interest at the end of the day immediately preceding the relevant due date for repayment. Interest on the
Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it
was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding.

If interest is to be calculated for a period of less than one year (a ‘‘Calculation Period’’) it shall be
calculated on the basis of the Day Count Fraction. ‘‘Day Count Fraction’’ means with regard to the
calculation of interest on any Note for any Calculation Period the number of days in the Calculation Period
divided by 360, the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with twelve 30-day
months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding.

A Default shall occur, irrespective of any notice, if any amounts payable under the Notes are not paid
when due. Any due and unpaid amount of principal shall, irrespective of any notice and for so long as such
Default remains outstanding, bear additional default interest at a rate equal to one percent per annum
from and including the relevant due date to but excluding the date of payment.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes will be subject to the relevant
procedures of the common depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream. If a particular interest payment
date is not a Business Day, then the payment date will move to the next Business Day, and the Holders of
such Notes will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Methods of receiving payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; _provided that all such_
payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held
by a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee, as applicable, will be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (‘‘Definitive
**Registered Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes in the City of London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be
paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto, or by bank
transfer to an account denominated in the currency of the Notes as shown on the register of Holders of
Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See ‘‘—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes’’.

**_Book-entry; Delivery and Form_**

The Notes will be issued in global registered form without interest coupons, as follows:

- Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date,
be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

- Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The
Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

133


-----

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to Persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Transfer
_Restrictions’’. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests’’) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after
such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of A100,000
principal amount and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof, in each case upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and
will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully
under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of A100,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the
transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and
to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date with respect
to such Notes; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered Holders of Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

**_Security; Release of Collateral_**

As of the Issue Date, the payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Parent under the
Parent Guarantee will be secured by the following collateral (subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens,

134


-----

applicable perfection requirements and exceptions and limitations described herein) (collectively, the
‘‘Collateral’’):

(a) a first-priority pledge over all the shares in the Issuer;

(b) a first-priority assignment of claims under shareholder loans granted by the Parent to the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(c) a first-priority assignment by the Issuer of payment claims against its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(d) a first-priority pledge over the Issuer’s bank accounts kept in Germany; and

(e) a first-priority pledge over certain stock in listed companies held by the Issuer for investment
purposes.

In determining whether and what additional collateral and guarantees may be provided, the Agreed
Security Principles as set forth in the Senior Facilities Agreement will be taken into account, including the
following:

- general law and statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, insolvency or ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, retention of title claims and similar
principles may limit the ability of a member of the group to provide a guarantee or security or may
require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise;

- in determining whether or not security shall be taken or perfected due regard shall be made to the
applicable cost and a cost/benefit analysis, which shall include that no incremental costs must be
incurred and no administrative burden or material inconvenience to the ordinary course of operations
of the provider of any security interest must be assumed which is disproportionate to the benefit
obtained by the beneficiaries of that security interest;

- certain supervisory board, works council or other external body consent or advice may be required to
enable a member of the group to provide a guarantee or security; such guarantee and/or security shall
not be provided unless such consent or advice has been received provided that reasonable endeavors
have been used by the relevant member of the group to obtain the relevant consent or advice to the
extent reasonably practicable and permissible by law, regulation and custom;

- any assets subject to bona fide third-party arrangements which are permitted by the terms of the
Senior Facilities Agreement and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from
any relevant Security Document, provided that all reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to subject
any such assets to transaction security shall be used by the relevant security grantor if the relevant
asset is material and _provided that all share pledges will create first priority security over the shares_
pledged (subject to any pre-existing security permitted by the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement
over companies which become members of the group after the Issue Date); and

- members of the group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security Documents if (or
to an extent) it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the group or if the same
would entail a significant risk of violating the fiduciary duties of those directors or contravening any
contractual or legal prohibition or restriction or resulting in personal or criminal liability on the part
of any officer.

Furthermore, any assets (other than shares and intra group receivables) subject to pre-existing third-party
arrangements which are permitted by the Indenture and which prevent those assets from being charged
will be excluded from any relevant Security Document. Also, no guarantee or security shall be required
from any member of the group that is a non-wholly owned member of the group and no security will be
required over the shares held by any member of the group in a non-wholly owned member of the group
unless is becomes directly or indirectly a wholly-owned member of the Restricted Group (and qualify as a
material company).

Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions which, in the case of some Collateral, will not be completed until
after the Issue Date

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the
Holders of the Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral
(including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement). Any additional security interests that may in

135


-----

the future be pledged to secure obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees would also
constitute Collateral.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘—Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Liens’’, the Parent, the Issuer and its_
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with certain
future issuances of Indebtedness of the Parent, the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any
Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee
_and Security Interests’’._

The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders of Notes and the creditors of other obligations secured thereby. No appraisals of any Collateral
have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Security Agent or the Trustee in connection with the
offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of
time, or at all. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure
_the obligations under the Notes’’._

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents as between (a) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under the
Indenture and (b) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral,
respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which
provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes are
secured equally and ratably by first priority security interests. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may
be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’, ‘‘—Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘—Certain Definitions—Permitted_
_Collateral Liens’’._

References to ‘‘first priority’’ security interests include security interests that were created second in time
and thus in ranking but are contractually pari passu first-priority and entitled to equal treatment with other
first-priority security secured creditors by virtue of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Parent will grant security over the Collateral to secure
the payment when due of, among others, the Issuer’s and the Parent’s payment obligations under the
Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents have been or will be entered into
by, among others as the case may be, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the
secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name,
but for the benefit of the secured parties (including the Trustee, the Holders of Notes from time to time
and the Senior Facilities Lenders). The Holders of Notes may only act through the Security Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
security interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the
security interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders of Notes might
not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes’’._

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Parent will have the right to remain in possession
and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing Notes, to freely operate the property and assets
constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all
dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock that is part of
the Collateral).

136


-----

The Security Agent will release the security interest in respect of the Collateral under one or more of the
following circumstances:

(a) in connection with any sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such
property or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition does not violate the provisions described under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets’’ below and is otherwise in compliance with the Indenture;_

(b) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor which was part of
the Collateral;

(c) if the Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary as permitted
under and in compliance with the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of
such Restricted Subsidiary;

(d) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in ‘‘—Defeasance’’ and
‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(e) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(f) in connection with an enforcement action taken by certain secured creditors of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(g) as provided for under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’;

(h) with respect to any property or assets that become Collateral securing the Notes and/or any Note
Guarantee pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’, upon the release and
discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of the Initial Lien, to the extent that such
Lien does not secure any other Pari Passu Indebtedness;

(i) in accordance with the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(j) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation’’; or_

(k) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

The Security Agent shall be entitled to accept such Officers’ Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as
sufficient evidence of compliance with this paragraph, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on
the Holders.

The Security Agent will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing
the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any
action on the part of the Trustee.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer under its financing arrangements, including without
limitation, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and certain hedging
obligations, will be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement entered into on July 6, 2018, as amended and
restated from time to time, between, among others, the Issuer, the Senior Facilities Lenders and the
Security Agent and to be acceded by the Trustee on or prior to the Issue Date. Any proceeds received upon
any enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations owing to the Security Agent, any receiver
or delegate have been repaid from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness
of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. For further details, see under ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’._

137


-----

**Release of Note Guarantees**

A Note Guarantee shall be released and discharged, automatically, unconditionally and without further
action on the part of the Security Agent or the Trustee:

(a) (i) except for the Parent Guarantee, upon a sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of any Capital Stock of the relevant
Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company as a result of which such Guarantor
would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary) or (ii) in connection with any sale, exchange, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case, if the sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition
does not violate the provisions described under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’ below
and is otherwise in compliance with the Indenture;

(b) upon the release of the Guarantee of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the relevant Note
Guarantee under the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Future Guarantors’’ so long as
no Event of Default would arise as a result and no other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor
at that time is Guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor;

(c) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in
‘‘—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’ and ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

(d) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(e) if the Issuer designates a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary as permitted under and in
compliance with the Indenture;

(f) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or Security Document;

(g) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Guarantors’’; or_

(h) as provided for under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’.

No release and discharge of a Note Guarantee pursuant to clauses (b) and (e) above shall be effective (i) if
a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture as of the time of such
proposed release and discharge until such time as such Default or Event of Default is cured or waived and
(ii) if so requested by the Security Agent, until the Issuer shall have delivered to the Security Agent (x) an
Officers’ Certificate and (y) Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent set forth in the
Indenture have been fulfilled and that such release and discharge is authorized and permitted pursuant to
the Indenture. The Security Agent shall be entitled to accept such Officers’ Certificate and Opinion of
Counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of such conditions precedent, in which event it shall be
conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Note Guarantee, as specified above, the Security Agent,
subject to receipt of certain documents from the Issuer, the Parent or a Guarantor, will take all necessary
action and execute any documents, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably required in order to evidence such
release, discharge and termination in respect of any Note Guarantee to be released as described above.
None of the Issuer, the Parent nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to
reflect any such release, discharge or termination.

**Restricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’. However, under
the circumstances described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’, the
Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee
the Notes.

138


-----

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a ‘‘Paying Agent’’ and, together, the ‘‘Paying
**Agents’’) for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.**

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrar or the Transfer
Agent without prior notice to the holders of the Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any
change of the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent.

In addition, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent in connection with the Notes,
_provided, however in no event may the Issuer act as Paying Agent or appoint a Paying Agent in any_
member state of the European Union where the Paying Agent would be obliged to withhold or deduct tax
in connection with any payment made by it in relation to the Notes unless the Paying Agent would be so
obliged if it were located in all other member states. The Issuer will make payments on the Global Notes to
the Paying Agent for further credit to Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) which will in turn,
distribute such payments in accordance with its procedures. The Issuer will make all payments in same-day
funds.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each a ‘‘Registrar’’) and one or more transfer agents
(each a ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The initial Registrar for the Notes will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A..
The initial transfer agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. No service charge will be made for any
registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of the Notes, but, in certain circumstances, the Issuer
may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable
in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Note Guarantee, any
present or future Guarantor (including the Parent) or any successor of any of the foregoing (each a
‘‘Payor’’) under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee shall be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, unless the deduction or withholding of
such Taxes is required by law. If any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed by
or on behalf of or levied within (i) the Federal Republic of Germany, (ii) any jurisdiction from or through
which payment on the Notes or a Note Guarantee is made for or on behalf of a Payor, (iii) any other
jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be resident or has a permanent
establishment for tax purposes or any (iv) province, municipality or other political subdivision or taxing
authority in or of any such jurisdiction under foregoing (i) through (iii) (any such jurisdiction under
foregoing (i) through (iv) a ‘‘Relevant Tax Jurisdiction’’), will at any time be required to be made from any
payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the Parent) under or with respect
to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the relevant Payor shall pay (together with such payment) such
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Notes
after such withholding or deduction (including any deduction or withholding from such additional
amounts) shall equal the respective amounts of principal and interest that would have been receivable in
respect of the relevant Notes, in the absence of such deduction or withholding (the aggregate of such
additional amounts, ‘‘Additional Amounts’’), except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable with
respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the Holder or
beneficial owner of a Note (or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) having, or
having had, some personal or business connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (other than the
mere acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note, the enforcement of rights under
such Note or under a Note Guarantee, or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or Note
Guarantee);

(b) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, including for the avoidance of doubt any German
withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer), plus solidarity surcharge (Solidarit¨atszuschlag) thereon, levied in
Germany by a custodian bank or a disbursing agent acting on behalf of the Holder;

139


-----

(c) any Taxes imposed on a payment on a Note presented for payment (where presentation is required for
payment) by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the
relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(d) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(e) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the failure of the
Holder, following the written request of the Payor, the Paying Agent, or any other person acting as an
agent for any Payor or the Paying Agent addressed to the Holder (and made at a time that would
enable the Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request, and in all events,
at least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be required), to comply with any
certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial
owner is not resident in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the Holder
or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(f) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed under section 1471 through
1474 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as of the date of this offering
memorandum (and any amended or successor version of such sections that is substantively
comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), including any current or future
Treasury regulations or other official interpretations thereunder or any law or regulation
implementing an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. government and the United
States with respect to the foregoing;

(g) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last of day of such 30 day period);

(h) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed on or with respect to any
payments under, or with respect to, the Notes or under or with respect to any Note Guarantee by
reason of the Holder being, or having been a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the
sole beneficial owner of any such payments to the extent that such Taxes would not have been imposed
or required to be withheld or deducted on such payments had the beneficial owner of the applicable
Notes been the holder of such Note; or

(i) any combination of items (a) through (h) above.

In cases where the deduction or withholding of Taxes on or with respect to any payments under or with
respect to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee is required by law to be made by a Payor, the
Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from
each Relevant Tax Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will furnish to a Holder upon written request
within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing payment by the Payor, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s efforts to obtain
receipts, receipts are not obtained, other reasonably satisfactory evidence of payments by the Payor.

If the Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such
payment, at least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or
any Note Guarantee is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the
45th day prior to such date, in which case it must be delivered promptly thereafter), the Payor will deliver
to the Paying Agent an Officers’ Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the
amounts estimated to be payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to
inform the relevant Holders of the payment of such Additional Amounts in accordance with the
procedures set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ on the payment date.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including penalties and
interest related thereto) which arise from the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of the Notes or
any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the

140


-----

Notes), or the receipt of any payments with respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes or any Note
Guarantee (limited, in the case of any such taxes, charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any
payments with respect to the Notes, to any such taxes, charges or levies that are not excluded under
items (a) and (c) through (h) of the first paragraph of this covenant).

Whenever in the Indenture or in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment or non-payment of principal, premium or interest, if any, or any other amount payable under or
with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the
payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or
would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligation will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction
in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the Parent) is organized or
otherwise considered to be resident or conducts business for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment on the Notes or any Note Guarantee is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or
any Guarantor (including the Parent) (or any successor thereto) and any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantors
(including the Parent) under or in connection with the Notes. Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than euro (the ‘‘Required Currency’’), which is made to or for the account of any Holder in
lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the ‘‘Judgment Currency’’), whether as a result of any judgment
or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or a Guarantor (including the Parent),
shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer, the Parent’s or the Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture
and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required
Currency with such Holder, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets
with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of
exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency.
If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the
Required Currency originally due to such Holder, as the case may be, the Issuer shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Holder, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result
of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other
obligations contained in the Indenture and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action,
shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder from time to time and shall continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount
due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and except pursuant to ‘‘—Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers’’ and
‘‘—Early Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option prior to
February 15, 2023.

At any time prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of
the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional
Notes) with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 103.500% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on
the relevant interest payment date); _provided, however, that:_

(i) at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of
any Additional Notes) remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice.

At any time prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part
of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and

141


-----

unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date (subject
to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time prior to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may redeem in each calendar year up to 10% of the
original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes) at
a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption
date (subject to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time on or after to February 15, 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a
part of the Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on February 15 of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of Holders of Notes to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

2023 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 101.750%
2024 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.875%
2025 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the due date for any
redemption payment in respect of the Note is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

**Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers**

In connection with any tender for, or other offer to purchase, the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% of
the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw
such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the
Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the
Holders of Notes shall be deemed to have consented to such tender offer or other offer and, accordingly,
the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 and not more than 60 days’ notice
following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a
price equal to the price (excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) paid to each other
Holder in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

**Early Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

If (i) any Payor becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts as set forth under ‘‘—Payment of Additional
_Amounts’’ above, (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the taking of reasonable measures available to_
the Payor and (iii) the requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any change in or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before, and which becomes effective on or after, the Issue Date or, if
a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction has changed since the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction became an applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction pursuant to the Indenture (the ‘‘Relevant
**Tax Jurisdiction Date’’); or**

(b) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official
position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations
or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice), which change, amendment, application or interpretation has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before, and becomes effective on or after, the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction Date (each of the foregoing in clauses (a) and (b), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

142


-----

the Notes may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Issuer, upon not less than
10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice of redemption at 100% of the outstanding principal amount
thereof together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a
‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) and Additional Amounts, if any, then due and that will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof).

Prior to giving any notice of redemption pursuant to this provision, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee
(i) an Officers’ Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have
occurred and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel qualified under the laws of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction to the
effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change
in Tax Law. The Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers’ Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of such conditions precedent, in which event it shall be conclusive
and binding on the Holders.

No notice of redemption pursuant to this provision may be given (i) earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in
respect of the Notes then due, or (ii) if at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts does not remain in effect.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is
incorporated or organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Notices**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select
Notes for redemption on a _pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Clearstream and_
Euroclear (as applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository
requirements. Neither the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in
accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer
shall publish notice of redemption in accordance with the prevailing rules of the Exchange and in addition
for such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (except as
permitted below), mail such notice to Holders of the Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their
respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar with a copy to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent. In the case of Global Notes, such notice of redemption may also be sent in
accordance with the rules and procedures of Clearstream or Euroclear (as applicable). On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or the part of the Notes called for redemption.

If any Notes are to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive
Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note
redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion
thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due
on the date fixed for redemption.

The Issuer may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market
purchase, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable laws, as long as such
transaction does not otherwise violate the Indenture.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

143


-----

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or
any part (equal to A100,000 or an integral multiple of A1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable purchase date (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Price’’),
subject to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date.

No later than 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall give written notice in accordance
with the procedures set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ below, with a copy to the Trustee, stating:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that each Holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at the Change of Control Purchase Price (the ‘‘Change of
**Control Payment’’);**

(b) the repurchase date (the repurchase date so stated the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’), which
date shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is given;

(c) the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in
order to have its Notes repurchased;

(d) that, if such notice is given prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control;

(e) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

(f) that any Note accepted for Change of Control Payment will cease to accrue interest after the Change
of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; and

(g) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest (the offer so being made
the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’).

The Issuer shall not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes an offer in a manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption has
been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’, unless and until
there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned
upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

For so long as the Notes are listed the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will
notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

Except as otherwise set forth under this heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of
_Control’’, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction that may
adversely affect the Holders if such transaction does not constitute a Change of Control. The Change of
Control provisions described under this heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of
_Control’’ may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving the Issuer by_
increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection
with the repurchase of Notes. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or assets of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a

144


-----

Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will have sufficient funds
or other resources to pay the Change of Control Payment for all the Notes that might be delivered by
Holders thereof seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
_Structure—We may not be able to repay the Notes when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to_
_do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control_
_provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of_
_certain important corporate events’’._

**Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur
any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any_
Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if (i) on the date thereof and after
giving _pro forma effect thereto (including_ _pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) (x) the Fixed_
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00,
and (y) to the extent such Indebtedness is purported to be secured by a Lien, the Consolidated Secured
Net Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be no greater than 3.75 to 1.00 and
(ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence of
Incurring the Indebtedness.

The foregoing paragraph shall not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(i) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with a Credit
Facility (including under ancillary facilities made available under such Credit Facility) in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed (A) the greater of (x) A400 million and (y) 90% of Consolidated
EBITDA, plus (B) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (i)
or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(ii) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that

(A) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not the Issuer
or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and to the extent legally permitted (the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the reasonable
judgment of directors of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil
or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness) expressly
subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations then due with respect to the
Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the relevant Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and

(B) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock that results in any such Indebtedness
being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and (y) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is neither the Issuer nor a Restricted
Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (ii);

(iii) any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or clause (iv), (v), or (x) or this clause (iii);

(iv) Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the relevant transactions described
under ‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’ (other than any Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility
permitted under clause (i) above or any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (ii), (vi) or (vii));

(v) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer and the Guarantors represented by the Notes to be issued on the
Issue Date and the Note Guarantees in respect of these Notes;

(vi) Indebtedness under Hedging Obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is
Incurred in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes;

145


-----

(vii) Indebtedness Incurred under a Guarantee by any Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be Incurred by
another provision of this covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’; _provided, however, that if the_
Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee,
then the Guarantee must be subordinated or _pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the_
Indebtedness guaranteed;

(viii)Indebtedness Incurred after the Issue Date in respect of workers’ compensation claims, early
retirement obligations, or social security or wage taxes in the ordinary course of business;

(ix) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations,
Purchase Money Obligations or other Indebtedness Incurred or assumed in connection with the
acquisition or development of real or personal, movable or immovable, property or other assets
(including Capital Stock), in each case Incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing all or any
part of the purchase price, lease expense, rental payments (other than lease payments or rental
expenses under a capitalized lease for reporting purposes under IFRS) or cost of design, installation,
construction or improvement of property used in the business of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount pursuant to this clause (ix), including any Refinancing
Indebtedness that refinances such Indebtedness, not to exceed the greater of (x) A50 million and
(y) 11.5% of Consolidated EBITDA at any time outstanding; _provided that the principal amount of_
any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (ix) did not in each case at the time of Incurrence
exceed the Fair Market Value of the acquired or constructed asset or improvement so financed;

(x) Indebtedness (a) Incurred by the Issuer or any Guarantor and used to finance an acquisition of assets
and assumption of related liabilities (if any) or (b) of any Person outstanding on the date on which
such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise
combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities),
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that at the time such Restricted Subsidiary
is acquired (or other transaction is made) by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary, (A) the
Issuer would have been able to Incur A1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (i)(x) of the
first paragraph of this covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio of the Issuer would not be less than it was immediately prior to such acquisition or other
transaction, in each case after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant
to this clause (x);

(xi) Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of (a) letters of credit, surety,
performance or appeal bonds, completion guarantees, judgment, advance payment, customs, VAT or
other tax guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary course of business of such Person
and not in connection with the borrowing of money, including letters of credit or similar instruments
in respect of self-insurance and workers compensation obligations, (b) the financing of insurance
premiums in the ordinary course of business, (c) the honoring by a bank or other financial institution
of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of
business, (d) inventory financing or any guarantees thereof and (e) any customary cash management,
cash pooling or netting or setting-off arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); provided, however, that, in relation to the
foregoing sub-clauses (a) through (d), upon the drawing of such letters of credit or other instrument,
such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing;

(xii) Indebtedness Incurred in any Qualified Securitization Financing;

(xiii)Subordinated Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in respect of amounts under
intercompany loans arising pursuant to clause (xv) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Covenants—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments’’; and_

(xiv)in addition to the items referred to in clauses (i) through (xiii) above, Indebtedness of the Issuer and
any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate amount not exceeding A30 million outstanding at any one
time; provided that the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this
clause (xiv) by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed A10 million
outstanding at any one time.

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ covenant:

(i) in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the foregoing first paragraph of this covenant ‘‘—Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’ and clauses (i) through (xiv) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its_
sole discretion, will be permitted to classify and may from time to time reclassify such item of
Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one or more of the foregoing clauses (i) through (xiv) of the second paragraph of this
covenant or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided that all Indebtedness_
outstanding on the Issue Date under any Credit Facility shall be deemed incurred under clause (i) of
the second paragraph of this covenant and not under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (iv)
of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not later be reclassified;

(ii) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on a clause of
this covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the relevant percentage restriction
to be exceeded if calculated based on the relevant percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of
such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA shall be deemed not to be exceeded, as
long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance,
costs, fees and other expenses in connection with such refinancing;

(iii) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously
repaid pursuant to ‘‘cash sweep’’ or ‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit
Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for
the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred
and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) for the purposes of determining Consolidated EBITDA under this covenant ‘‘—Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured at the option of the Issuer on the most_
recent date on which new commitments are obtained or on the date on which new Indebtedness is
Incurred;

(v) in the event Indebtedness relates to Guarantees of Indebtedness permitted by this covenant, such
Guarantees shall not be treated as an additional Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(vi) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor, or preferred stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(vii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(A) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount;

(B) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(C) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(x) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(y) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person;

(viii)for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving Credit Facility; _provided that:_

(A) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue
Date will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date;
and

147


-----

(B) if for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against
fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is
denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in euro will be the amount of the principal payment required to be
made under such currency agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus
the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by
such currency agreement;

(ix) the principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the
Indebtedness being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced
determined as of the date such Indebtedness was originally Incurred, except that to the extent that:

(A) such Euro Equivalent was determined based on an agreement intended to protect against
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be
determined in accordance with sub-clause (B) of clause (viii) above; and

(B) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Euro Equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred; and

(x) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio
and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive
agreements or actions for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into or taken, and such
baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent
with the _pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or_
Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, after giving effect to such Limited Condition
Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of
the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited
Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio),
and, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated EBITDA of the
Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be
deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining
whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (2) such baskets or ratios shall
not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related
transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of
entry into such definitive agreement or action, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the
definitive agreements or action are entered or taken and outstanding thereafter for purposes of
calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement or action and
before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

Agreement (an ‘‘Amendment’’); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained

good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) and either (x) the Issuer determines
that such encumbrances and restrictions will not adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal

agreement or agreements (and at the time of any modification of the terms of any such encumbrance
or restriction); and

maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at least equal to the Fair Market Value
(such Fair Market Value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset
Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer (including as to the
value of all non-cash consideration), of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

153


-----

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, at least 75% of the consideration is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of this ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’ covenant, each of the following
shall be deemed cash:

(A) any liabilities, as shown on the Issuer’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities, Disqualified Stock and liabilities that
are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the
transferee of any such assets pursuant to any agreement that releases the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary from or indemnifies against further liability;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary from
such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary into cash or
Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Disposition, to the extent of
the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(C) any Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(D) consideration consisting of Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(E) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received and designated pursuant to this clause (E) that is at any one time
outstanding, not to exceed A20 million (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent the Issuer elects, to prepay, repay or purchase (x) Indebtedness that is secured by a
Permitted Collateral Lien that ranks equal to or in priority to any Lien on such assets securing the
Notes and the Note Guarantees and is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and the Note
Guarantees (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Senior Facilities Agreement and
any purchase or redemption of any Notes (provided that any such purchase or redemption is at or
above 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of such purchase or redemption)), (y) Indebtedness
which is secured by a Lien (other than a Permitted Collateral Lien) on the asset which is the
subject of the Asset Sale or (z) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
(other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer), in each case, within
365 days from the date of the receipt of such Net Available Cash;

(B) to invest in Additional Assets within 365 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash
or pursuant to binding arrangements in place within such 365 day period; _provided that such_
binding arrangement is completed within 180 days of such 365 day period;

(C) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash
or pursuant to binding arrangements in place within such 365-day period; _provided that such_
binding arrangement is completed within 180 days of such 365-day period; or

(D) to make an offer to the Holders and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (to the extent the terms of
such Pari Passu Indebtedness so require) on a pro rata basis to purchase the Notes at a purchase
price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase and such Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to and
subject to the Indenture (an ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’).

The amount of such Net Available Cash not used as set forth in sub-clauses (A) to (C) of the preceeding
paragraph shall constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’ covenant, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
required to apply any Excess Proceeds in accordance with sub-clause (D) above unless the aggregate
Excess Proceeds from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with the foregoing
sub-clauses (A) to (C) exceeds A35 million. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari

154


-----

Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer
is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate
purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of
Notes surrendered by Holders thereof and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or
lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall accept the Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a _pro rata basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered_
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the Asset Disposition Offer. Upon
completion of such Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The
Asset Disposition Offer will remain open for a period of 20 Business Days following its commencement,
except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer
**Period’’). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the**
‘‘Asset Disposition Purchase Date’’), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer Amount’’)
or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. If the Asset Disposition
Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date,
any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Holder of record at the close of business on such record
date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful,
accept for payment, on a _pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of_
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, in each case with a principal amount of
A100,000 or in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will promptly (but in any case not
later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to
each tendering Holder of Notes or holder or lender of Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, an
amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn by such holder or lender, as the case may be, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase.
In addition, the Issuer will take any and all other actions required by the agreements governing the Pari
Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer on the
Asset Disposition Purchase Date.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into any transaction or series of related transactions (including the rendering of services) with any Affiliate
of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions, an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving
aggregate consideration in excess of A10 million unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction with a
Person who is not an Affiliate;

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of A20 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer (and such majority determines that such Affiliate Transaction satisfies
the criteria in clause (i)); and

(iii) in the event (a) such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of A30 million or
(b) such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of A20 million and there are
no Disinterested Directors, the Issuer shall have received a written opinion from an independent
investment bank or an accounting or appraisal firm of internationally recognized standing or other
recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and
conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required,
stating that such Affiliate Transaction is (x) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a
financial point of view or (y) not materially less favorable than those that might reasonably have been
obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not
an Affiliate.

155


-----

The provisions of the foregoing paragraph shall not apply to:

(i) transactions pursuant to any employee or director compensation arrangements or benefit plans
entered into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business of the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(iii) any Affiliate Transaction between the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(iv) any Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted Investment) permitted to be made pursuant to the
provisions set forth under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ above;

(v) the payment of reasonable and customary fees paid to, and indemnity provided on behalf of, officers,
directors or employees of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(vi) the incurrence of Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(vii) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated, by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and
transactions pursuant to any amendment (including to change any party to the agreement),
modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension,
taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the Holders than the original agreement as in effect
on the Issue Date;

(viii)any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to Affiliates of the Issuer;

(ix) transactions for which the Issuer shall have received a written opinion from an independent
investment bank or an accounting or appraisal firm of internationally recognized standing or other
recognized independent expert of international standing with experience appraising the terms and
conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required,
stating that such Affiliate Transaction is (a) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a
financial point of view or (b) not materially less favorable than those that might reasonably have been
obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not
an Affiliate;

(x) (x) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, landlord or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services or providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of trading, or
(y) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and any Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because a director of such Person is
also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, in each case, _provided_
(a) such transaction is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and (b) is on terms at
least as favorable as could have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person, in the
reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer
_provided such Officer has been delegated such power by the Board of Directors in the prior twelve_
months (provided no member of the Board of Directors or Officer of the Issuer with an interest in
such transaction may participate in such determination); and

(xi) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between or among the Parent,
the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary and any other Person with which the Parent, the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries files a consolidated tax return or with which the Parent, the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a group for tax purposes or any tax advantageous group
contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; _provided, however, that such payments or_
transactions will not exceed the lesser of (i) the amount of tax that the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would owe on a stand-alone basis if the Issuer were filing a separate tax return (or a
separate consolidated or combined tax return with its Restricted Subsidiaries that are part of that
consolidated or combined group) and (ii) the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries that are relieved thereby.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish in English to the Trustee:

(1) within 150 days following the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2019 and within 120 days following the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer thereafter,

156


-----

annual reports containing the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements
and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years, including complete
footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements; (b) pro forma key financial information for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as
to which such annual report relates (unless such _pro forma information has been provided in a_
previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below (provided that such pro forma financial information
will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer
will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials to the extent available
without unreasonable expense)); (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations (including a discussion by business
segment to the extent segment reporting is required under IFRS), financial condition and liquidity
and capital resources; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer,
material affiliate transactions and material debt instruments (unless such contractual arrangements
were described in a previous annual or quarterly report, in which case the Issuer need describe only
any material changes); and (e) material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 75 days following the end of the Issuer’s fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020 and 60 days
following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer thereafter,
quarterly reports containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash
flow for the quarterly and year to date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date,
and, the comparable prior year periods for the Issuer, together with condensed footnote disclosure;
(b) pro forma key financial information for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such
quarterly report relates (provided that such _pro forma financial information will be provided only to_
the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of
a material acquisition, acquired company financials (to the extent available without unreasonable
expense)); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements (including a
discussion by business segment to the extent segment reporting is required under IFRS), including a
discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and any
material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding period of the prior year;
and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of the chief executive officer, chief
financial officer or managing director of the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer or any other
material event that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event;

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to_
(i) contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or IFRS or (ii) include
separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In addition, if the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding
paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or
in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no
report need to include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any
disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a
type included in this offering memorandum.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the
Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required
to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

157


-----

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, the
Issuer will also (a) post such report on the Issuer’s website and (b) make available copies of such reports to
the Listing Agent, for the purpose of sending to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (to
the extent required by the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Trustee, the Holders,
prospective purchasers and beneficial owners of the Notes if such information referenced above in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above has been posted on the Issuer’s website.

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, within five Business Days after the delivery of
each report discussed in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, conduct a conference
call to discuss such report and the results of operation for the relevant reporting period.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Holding Company so long
as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to
content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to such
Holding Company and (b) explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to
such Holding Company, on the one hand, and the information to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries
on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into another Person, or
convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union as of December 31, 2003,
Switzerland, the United States of America or the District of Columbia, and the Successor Company (if
not the Issuer) will expressly assume in appropriate documentation delivered to the Trustee all the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee);

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financings the Successor Company
would be able to Incur at least an additional A1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (i)(x) of the first
paragraph of the ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ covenant above;

(iv) if any such transaction results in the Issuer or Successor Company being incorporated in a jurisdiction
other than Germany, the Board of Directors of the Issuer and the Successor Company will have
adopted a resolution stating that the transaction effecting such a change in jurisdiction was not being
entered into for a purpose which included subjecting the Issuer or the Successor Company, as the case
may be, to more favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws relating to creditors rights or similar laws; and

(v) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
to the effect that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and such supplemental
indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture, and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor
Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in
giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officers’ Certificate as to any matters of fact.

_Guarantors_

In addition, the Issuer shall not permit any Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to consolidate with or merge
with or into another Person, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of

158


-----

such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to
another Person, unless:

(i) either:

(A) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Guarantor’’) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union on
31 December 2003, Switzerland, the United States of America, the District of Columbia or the
jurisdiction in which it was originally organized, and such Person (if not a Guarantor) will
expressly assume in an appropriate documentation and delivered to the Trustee, all the
obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee(s), the Indenture (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee),
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents; or

(B) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the
properties and assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to, and as a result of, such transaction no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing;

(iii) in the case of clause (i)(A) above, if any such transaction results in the Guarantor or Successor
Guarantor being incorporated in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which it was organized as
of the Issue Date, the Board of Directors of the Guarantor and the Successor Guarantor will have
adopted a resolution stating that the transaction effecting such a change in jurisdiction was not being
entered into for a purpose which included subjecting the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor, as
the case may be, to more favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws relating to creditors rights or similar
laws; and

(iv) the Issuer and such Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee in accordance with ‘‘Notices’’ an Officers’
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer or lease, such supplemental indenture (if any is required in connection with such transaction)
and, in the case of clause (i)(A) only, such assumption by the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
comply with the Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture
(if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement
enforceable against the Successor Guarantor (in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee); _provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an_
Officers’ Certificate as to any matters of fact.

The successor to any Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the
applicable Note Guarantee.

This ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation, merger or transfer of
assets of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any
consolidation, merger or transfer of assets among Guarantors, or (c) any consolidation, merger or transfer
of assets among the Issuer and any Guarantor; provided that, clauses (i) and (v) of the first paragraph of
this covenant will be complied with. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph and clause (ii) of the second
paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any merger or consolidation of the Issuer or any Guarantors
with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or such Guarantor in another
jurisdiction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the
rules of The International Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of the occurrence of
any of the events described in this ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant in accordance with the
prevailing rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited.

159


-----

**_Future Guarantors_**

The Issuer shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and that, after the Issue Date,
Guarantees any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Senior Facilities Agreement
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles as set forth therein), to execute and deliver concurrently to the
Trustee a supplemental indenture providing for a Note Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant
to which such Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes, which Note Guarantee will be
senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

Each Additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to general statutory limitations, capital maintenance,
corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalization rules or other similar
laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction). See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—The Guarantee and each security interest may be limited by applicable law or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and Security Interests’’._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be
prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted
Subsidiary (including ‘‘whitewash’’ or similar procedures) or any liability for the officers, directors or
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Lines of Business_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a
Related Business, except as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on
The International Stock Exchange for so long as any Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is
unable to obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain
such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of the Notes on
another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be another stock exchange that is not
regulated by the European Union).

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay
or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any
consent or vote with respect to any waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture
unless (and to the extent such offer or payment is not prohibited by applicable law) such consideration is
offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set
forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or amendment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or
payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the
terms or provisions of the Indenture, to exclude the Holders in any jurisdiction where (A)(i) the
solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for
cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities
laws (including, but not limited to, the U.S. federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or
its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be
materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent
document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with
the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction) or (B) such solicitation would otherwise
not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

160


-----

**_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries shall be Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any newly
acquired or newly formed Subsidiary or a Person becoming a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or
other business combination transaction, or Investment therein) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary only if:

(i) such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of or have
any Investment in, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, any other Subsidiary of the Issuer
which is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(ii) no Indebtedness of such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at the date of designation, or at any
time thereafter, constitute Indebtedness pursuant to which the lender has recourse to any of the assets
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(iii) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary has
any direct or indirect obligation to:

(A) subscribe for additional Capital Stock of such Person; or

(B) maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or cause such person to achieve any
specified levels of operating results;

(iv) all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid)
in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount which shall be
the Restricted Payment’s Fair Market Value at the time of such transfer and a Restricted Payment in
such amount would be permitted at such time under the covenant set forth under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments’’ or the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments’’ and if such Subsidiary otherwise_
meets the definition of an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’; and

(v) after giving effect to, and as a result of, such designation there will be no Default or Event of Default.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that such designation shall be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness
by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such
designation shall be permitted only if (i) immediately after giving effect to such designation, no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Issuer could Incur at least A1.00 of
additional Indebtedness as described in clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’, on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation as if it had occurred at the_
beginning of the applicable reference period. Any such designation by the Board of Directors of the Issuer
shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Issuer giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such designation
complies with the foregoing conditions.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent and the Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission might or would have
the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood
that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of ‘‘Permitted Collateral Liens’’
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the
Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Parent and the Issuer will not, and the
Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the
Security Agent, for the benefit of the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; _provided_
that

(i) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; and

(ii) the Parent, the Issuer and the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens;
and _provided further, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed,_
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with such

161


-----

amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification or renewal, the Issuer
delivers to the Security Agent either:

(A) a solvency opinion from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing
confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any
relevant action with respect to the Security Documnents to which the Parent is a party as a
security grantor, confirming the solvency of the Parent), after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification
or replacement;

(B) a certificate from the chief financial officer, chief executive officer or the Board of Directors of
the relevant Person, which confirms the solvency of the person granting Security Interest after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement; or

(C) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes
created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph which shall not apply to the actions described in this paragraph,
at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders or the Trustee, the Security Agent
may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens to the
extent permitted by the Indenture; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) comply with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (v) evidence the succession of
another Person to the Issuer and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture,
the Notes and the Security Documents, in each case, in accordance with ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’;
(vi) provide for the release of property and assets constituting Collateral from the Lien of the Security
Documents or the release of a Note Guarantee granted by a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with
(and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; (vii) conform the
Security Documents to this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’; (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the
appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent; or (ix) make any other change thereto that does not
adversely affect the rights of the Holders in any material respect.

In the event that the Parent, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with this covenant,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications and each
of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement with no need for
instructions from Holders.

**_Security_**

The Parent and the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall procure that each Guarantor shall, at its own expense,
execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably
require

(i) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the
security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents; and

(ii) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part
of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all
powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of
those assets. The Parent and the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall procure that each Guarantor shall,
execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security
Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may
reasonably request.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

At the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence of any Indebtedness that is
permitted to share the Collateral, the Parent, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Senior Facilities
Lenders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each
an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or not materially less favorable to the Holders) or an amendment to, or an amendment and restatement
of, the Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment is not materially less favorable to the Holders);
_provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any_
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement; provided further that it is
understood and agreed that an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subjected to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to be on substantially
similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights of the
Holders and will be permitted by this covenant if, in each case, the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (and
any Lien in its favor), would not be otherwise prohibited by the Indenture.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Trustee,
the Security Agent or any Holder, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into
one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement;
(2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to
new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes); (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries or
Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (4) further secure
the Notes (including any Additional Notes); (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the
Collateral to secure Additional Notes; (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (7) amend the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof;
(8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to (i) remove any
references to any secured obligations following the full redemption or repayment of any such obligations
and the cancellation or termination of underlying contractual arrangements, as applicable and/or
(ii) replace any such references with references to any new contractual obligations governing any such
secured obligations that replace and/or refinance, as applicable such secured obligations, in each case to
the extent permitted by the Indenture; or (9) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect.

Save as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed
to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of, and to have directed the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into, each Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
any amendment referred to in the preceding paragraphs, and the Trustee or the Security Agent shall not be
required to seek the consent of any Holders to perform its obligations under and in accordance with this
covenant. Before entering into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement or effecting any amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to this covenant, the Trustee or the Security Agent may elect to base its
decision on an Officers’ Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall be
liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers’ Certificate or
Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall notify the Holders of the entry into an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement effected pursuant to this covenant without
undue delay in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants_**

If on any date following the date of the Indenture:

(i) the Notes are rated with an Investment Grade Rating by two Rating Agencies; and

(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the foregoing conditions being
referred to collectively as the ‘‘Suspension Condition’’);

163


-----

then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants
specifically listed under the following captions in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ (collectively, the
‘‘Suspended Covenants’’) of the Indenture will be suspended as to the Notes:

- ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

- ‘‘—Limitation on Lines of Business’’;

- ‘‘—Future Guarantors’’; and

- clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph and (ii) of the second paragraph, respectively, of ‘‘—Merger
_and Consolidation’’._

During any period that the foregoing sections have been suspended, the Issuer’s Board of Directors may
not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to ‘‘—Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries’’ unless the designation would have complied with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation_
_on Restricted Payments’’._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the
Suspended Covenants with respect to the Notes for any period of time as a result of the Suspension
Condition having been met and, subsequently, one or both of the respective Rating Agencies withdraw
their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the Investment Grade Rating assigned to the Notes such that
the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating by the respective two Rating Agencies, then the
Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants.
(a) Compliance with the Suspended Covenants with respect to Restricted Payments made after the time of
such withdrawal or downgrade (i) will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the reinstated
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant as if the provisions had been in effect since the Issue Date
(accordingly, Restricted Payments made during such period when the Suspended Covenants are suspended
will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments described under the first paragraph of
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’) and (ii) will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the
reinstated ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ covenant as if any Indebtedness incurred on or after the
occurrence of the Suspension Condition will be deemed to have been incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’; and (b) the Issuer will, and will cause each
Restricted Subsidiary that would have been required to Guarantee the Notes pursuant to ‘‘—Future
_Guarantors’’ during such period when the Suspended Covenants are suspended to take all actions it would_
have been required to take to comply with ‘‘—Future Guarantors’’ if it had not been suspended including
executing a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a
Guarantor under the Indenture and pledging the Restricted Subsidiary’s existing and future assets and
pledging all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary to secure the Notes and the Note
Guarantees; provided, further, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to
exist under the Indenture with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries will bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring after such Notes attain
the required ratings and before any reinstatement of the Suspended Covenants as provided above, or any
actions, taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligations arising prior to the reinstatement of the
Suspended Covenants, regardless of whether those actions or events would have been permitted if the
applicable sections had remained in effect during such period.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve an
Investment Grade Rating or have such Investment Grade Rating withdrawn. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied,
provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under
this caption to be effective.

164


-----

**Events of Default, Enforcement**

Each of the following constitutes an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(b) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due and payable at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon acceleration or
otherwise;

(c) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply with any obligation under the covenant set
forth under ‘‘—Covenants—Merger and Consolidation,’’ continued for 30 days;

(d) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply for 60 days after written notice from the
Trustee on behalf of the Holders or upon written instruction by Holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding with its other obligations contained in the Indenture;

(e) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for borrowed money by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the Indenture, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay when due principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such
Indebtedness prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period provided for under the terms
of such Indebtedness (‘‘payment default’’); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated aggregates A25 million or more;

(f) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization under bankruptcy laws of (i) the Issuer,
(ii) a Guarantor or (iii) a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary;

(g) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
A15 million (net of any amounts that are covered by insurance policies issued by reputable and
creditworthy insurance companies), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period
of 60 days after the judgment exceeding such threshold becomes final;

(h) any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full
force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture or as
provided under applicable law) or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or the Issuer or
any such Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing or in any pleading in any court its obligations under
the Indenture or its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days; or

(i) with respect to any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of A15 million, individually or in
the aggregate, (i) (a) the security interest under the Indenture or the Security Documents, at any time,
ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance with the terms of the
Security Documents and other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Notes or (b) any
security interest created thereunder or under the Security Documents is declared invalid or
unenforceable and such Default continues for 15 days after the Issuer becomes aware of the Default
or (ii) the Issuer, the Parent or any Guarantor asserts that any such security interest or Security
Document is invalid or unenforceable prior to the time that the Collateral is to be released to the
Issuer or the Guarantors.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing clause (f)) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
all outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer shall terminate the Notes and declare the principal
amount of and all accrued interest under all outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an
Event of Default with respect to the Issuer pursuant to the foregoing clause (f) occurs and is continuing,
the Notes will automatically be terminated and all payments under the Notes will become due and payable

165


-----

immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Certain
enforcement actions, including acceleration, will be suspended during a consultation period under the
Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default pursuant to
foregoing clause (e) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the relevant default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing
clause (e) shall be remedied or cured by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of
the relevant Indebtedness, or the relevant Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, within 20 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal,
premium, or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have
been cured or waived.

The Holders may rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences within three
months of the acceleration by simple majority vote of the Holders if such rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the aggregate of such
cast votes exceeds the number of votes having required the acceleration.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’), then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial
Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the
failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in ‘‘—Covenants—Reports’’, or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though
such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered (and, if requested, provided)
to the Trustee indemnity (including by way of prefunding) or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense that may be incurred. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or
the Notes unless:

(a) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(b) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(c) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days following the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(d) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not within such 60 day
period given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with
such request.

Subject to the Indenture and applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The
Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee
will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in
the conduct of such person’s own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any
other Holder or would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it
against all losses, liabilities, and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, within
120 days after the end of each fiscal year (and within 20 Business Days upon request at any time after the
120 days), an Officers’ Certificate stating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred
during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, after becoming aware of the

166


-----

occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute Defaults, their
status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may or, subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement with respect to any Note Guarantee and the Collateral, the Security Agent may:

(a) in its sole discretion, but shall not be required to, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the
Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable,
shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement
of any covenant or agreement in the Indenture or any Note Guarantee or in aid of the exercise of any
power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy, including making demand under one or
more of the Note Guarantees on behalf of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the
Trustee and the Security Agent indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory
to the Trustee and Security Agent against any loss, liability and expense; and

(b) prosecute and enforce all rights of action and claims under the Indenture or any Note Guarantee
without the possession of any of the Notes or the Global Notes or the production thereof in any
proceeding relating thereto, and to bring any such proceeding on behalf of the Holders.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions and without limiting the ability of the Issuer, without consent of the Trustee,
the Security Agent or any Holder, to direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance
with the covenant set forth under ‘‘—Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’ above, the
Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the
consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(i) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(ii) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(iv) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note
may be redeemed, in each case as described above under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’;

(v) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(vi) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts,
if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(vii) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of
Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if
any, on, the Notes;

(viii)release any security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture;

(ix) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver
of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

167


-----

(x) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under the Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(xi) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the
covenants described above under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control’’
and ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’) or

(xii) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

The Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented without the
consent of any Holder:

(i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(ii) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under any of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(iii) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(iv) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any
material respect under the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(v) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(vi) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘—Covenants—Future Guarantors’’, to
add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien
(including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with
respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment
is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(vii) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or the
Notes to any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this
‘‘Description of the Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the
Security Documents or the Notes;

(viii)to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent
to any of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(ix) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, in any property which is required by the
Security Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is
required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in
the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the covenant described under ‘‘—Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ is
complied with; or

(x) as provided in ‘‘—Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’.

In connection with such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely absolutely on an Officers’
Certificate and Opinions of Counsel.

168


-----

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver
under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will
not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may, as evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers’
Certificate, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the
outstanding Notes and the Note Guarantees (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’). Legal Defeasance means that the
Issuer will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding
Notes that are being defeased and Note Guarantees except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust account referred to
below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to exchange any Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes,
maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such
payments in trust;

(c) the rights and obligations of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors in
connection therewith; and

(d) the ‘‘Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’ provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’),
and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described
under ‘‘—Events of Default’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These
events do not include events relating to non-payment on the Notes or, solely with respect to the Issuer,
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance
option regardless of whether they previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(i) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of the Issuer (acting in good
faith), to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the outstanding Notes
on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must
(x) prior to depositing such monies or securities to the trust account, procure an Opinion of Counsel
stating, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, that the trust account will be bankruptcy
remote; (y) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a particular
redemption date; and (z) if applicable, have delivered to the Paying Agent and the Trustee an
irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(ii) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
stating that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service a ruling, or (ii) since the original issue date of the Notes, there has been a change in applicable
U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal

169


-----

income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(iii) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(iv) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over the other creditors of
the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or
others; and

(v) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating
to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

The Trustee shall be entitled to accept any Officers’ Certificate and Opinion of Counsel delivered to it
pursuant to this paragraph as sufficient evidence of compliance with the relevant paragraph and shall not
be obligated to independently investigate whether the requirements of the relevant paragraph are
otherwise met.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when:

(1) either:

(a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed
Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the
funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee or Paying Agent for
cancellation; or

(b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee or Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become
due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory
to the Paying Agent for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and
at the expense, of the Issuer;

(2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity directed,
designated, selected or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee for this

If requested in writing by the Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption
or pursuant to the applicable Officers’ Certificate the Trustee, Paying Agent or such other entity directed,
designated, selected or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee for this purpose,
as applicable, shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the
redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least five
Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier payment date (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or
redemption date as set forth above shall not include any negative interest, present value adjustment,
additional break cost or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented
by a Global Note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders
holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable
procedures of the clearing system.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Notes
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in the Indenture where indemnified to its satisfaction. During the existence of an Event of
Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
If the Trustee, the Security Agent or any other agent under the Indenture becomes the Holder, beneficial
owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not
the Trustee, Security Agent or such other agent. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in transactions
with the Issuer and its Affiliates.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is
not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six
months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, expenses
Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent
the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any notice to the Holders of the
Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the
principal amount of the Notes outstanding. In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global
Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or; if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person
by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed
within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall
not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Parent, the Issuer or the
Guarantors will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or the Indenture or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each holder by
accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Parent, the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any,
on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against
the Parent, the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six
years after the applicable due date for payment of interest, provided that such claim has not been stayed or
otherwise prohibited or delayed by applicable law or court order.

**Additional Information**

Following the Issue Date, copies of the Indenture, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement will be
available at the specified office of the Paying Agent and the registered office of the Issuer.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with English
law.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the Parent) will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County
and State of New York, United States. The Indenture will provide that the Parent, the Issuer and each
Guarantor, will appoint Law Debenture Corporate Services Inc., 801 2nd Avenue, Suite 403, New York,
NY10017, United States of America, as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding
with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New
York state court located in the City of New York.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained
in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with
respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

Subsidiary or is merged with or into the Issuer) or an acquisition of assets, including any acquisition of
assets occurring in connection with a transaction requiring a calculation to be made hereunder, and
which constitutes all or substantially all of a company, division, operating unit, segment, business,
group of related assets or line of business, Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period
shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Indebtedness)
as if such Investment or acquisition occurred on the first day of such period; and

(5) if since the beginning of such period any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or
was merged with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period)
will have Incurred any Indebtedness or discharged any Indebtedness, made any Asset Disposition or
any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (3)
or (4) of this definition if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary during such period,
Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma
effect thereto as if such Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness, Asset Disposition or Investment or
acquisition of assets occurred on the first day of such period.

definition, the _pro forma calculations (including, without limitation, in respect of anticipated expense or_
cost savings and expense or cost synergies relating to any such transaction) shall be determined in good

period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness).

or more of Consolidated EBITDA or which has total assets or sales representing 10% or more of the total
assets or sales of the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries (respectively), in each case, after elimination
of any effects of any intra-group transactions, and determined by reference to the most recent audited
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and the most recent audited (if available) or unaudited (if
audited statements are not available) unconsolidated financial statements of such Restricted Subsidiary.

‘‘Stated Maturity’’ means, with respect to any security, the date specified in such security as the fixed date on
which the payment of principal of such security is due and payable, including pursuant to any mandatory
redemption provision, but shall not include any contingent obligations to repay, redeem or repurchase any
such principal prior to the date originally scheduled for the payment thereof.

‘‘Subordinated Indebtedness’’ means, with respect to any person, any Indebtedness (whether outstanding on
the Issue Date or thereafter Incurred) which is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes
pursuant to a written agreement.

‘‘Subordinated Shareholder Debt’’ means any Indebtedness provided to the Issuer held by any Holding
Company or any Permitted Holder in exchange for or pursuant to any security, instrument or agreement
other than Capital Stock, together with any such security, instrument or agreement and any other security
or instrument other than Capital Stock issued in payment of any obligation under any Subordinated
Shareholder Debt; provided that such Subordinated Shareholder Debt:

(1) does not (including upon the happening of any event) mature or require any amortization or other
payment of principal prior to the first anniversary of the maturity of the Notes (other than through
conversion or exchange of any such security or instrument for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than
Disqualified Stock) or for any other security or instrument meeting the requirements of this
definition);

(2) does not (including upon the happening of any event) require the payment of cash interest prior to the
first anniversary of the final maturity of the Notes;

(3) does not (including upon the happening of any event) provide for the acceleration of its maturity nor
confers any right (including upon the happening of any event) to declare a default or event of default

Notes;

(4) is not secured by a Lien on any assets of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and is not Guaranteed

(5) is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Notes in the event of any
default, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, winding up or other disposition of assets of the
Issuer;

(6) does not (including upon the happening of any event) restrict the payment of amounts due in respect
of the Notes or compliance by the Issuer with its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture;

(7) does not (including upon the happening of an event) constitute Voting Stock; and

(8) is not (including upon the happening of any event) mandatorily convertible or exchangeable, or
convertible or exchangeable at the option of the holder, in whole or in part, prior to the date on which
the Notes mature other than into or for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer;

_provided, however, that any event or circumstance that results in such Indebtedness ceasing to qualify as a_
Subordinated Shareholder Debt, such Indebtedness shall constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by
the Issuer which incurrence will only be permitted to the extent permitted under the provision set forth
under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’, and any and all Restricted Payments made through the

194


-----

use of the net proceeds from the Incurrence of such Indebtedness since the date of the original issuance of
such Subordinated Shareholder Debt shall constitute new Restricted Payments that are deemed to have
been made after the date of the original issuance of such Subordinated Shareholder Debt.

‘‘Subsidiary’’ means, with respect to any specified Person:

with respect thereto) that are imposed by any government or other taxing authority.

‘‘Transactions’’ has the meaning given to such term in this offering memorandum under the caption
‘‘Summary—The Transactions’’.

‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ means:

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A
**Global Notes’’). Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will**
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes’’ and, together with the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The
Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name
of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interest’’ and, together with the
144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry
Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global
Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in
excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the
interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of
the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities
in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not
have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form
and will not be considered the registered owners or ‘‘holder’’ of Notes under the Indenture for any
purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominee),
will be considered the holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar under the Indenture nor any of
the Issuer’s respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating
to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered Notes
in certificated form (the ‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’):

- if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

- if the owner of a Book-Entry interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being
taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in ‘‘Notice to Investors’’, unless that legend is not required
by the Indenture or applicable law.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the

196


-----

holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in
connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that
under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate
basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than A100,000 principal amount at
maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) to the Paying Agent. In turn, the Paying
Agent will make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer
Agent, and Registrar will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for
Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments
and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent,
and Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in
‘‘street name’’.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons
in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes
must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’. Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with

197


-----

Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S.
Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and in
accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of
the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
relevant Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the
Transfer Agent a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable
to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible
for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream
hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain
a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities
in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.
In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive
distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately
available funds.

198


-----

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time
of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAXATION**

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)**

The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions
tax (‘‘FTT’’) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Spain (‘‘Participating Member States’’). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.
The proposal is currently under review. The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced
in the form of the proposal, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market
transactions) in certain circumstances.

According to a draft bill published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance on 10 December 2019, the
FTT levied at a rate of 0.2% would be limited to shares of listed companies whose head office is located in
a Member State of the European Union and whose market capitalization exceeds EUR 1 billion on
1 December of the preceding year. Based on this draft bill, the FTT would not apply to financial
transactions in the Notes.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, is the subject
of legal challenge and may therefore not be implemented at all. It may also be altered prior to any
implementation, the timing of which (if at all) remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide
to participate. Prospective Holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in
relation to the FTT.

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

Income received from the Notes is subject to taxation. In particular, the tax laws of any jurisdiction with
authority to impose taxes on the Holder and the tax laws of the Issuer’s state of incorporation, statutory
seat and place of effective management, i.e. Germany, might have an impact on the income received from
the Notes.

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes, and, in particular, does not consider
any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the
tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate (‘‘flat tax regime’’) for certain investment
income and, in particular, interest income on the part of German tax resident private investors. There is an
ongoing discussion in Germany whether the reduced tax rate should be increased or abolished so that
investment income would be taxed at higher rates. It is still unclear whether, how and when the current
discussion may result in any legislative changes. However, the coalition agreement (Koalitionsvertrag) of the
current German federal government includes the intention to repeal the ‘‘flat tax regime’’ for interest
income which would, most likely, result in the taxation of interest income (derived from private
investments) at the regular progressive tax rates of up to 45% (plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge
(Solidarit¨atszuschlag) thereon) on the part of German tax resident individuals. It is currently unclear if and
when respective legislation measures will be initiated to implement the desired repeal. Moreover, a
recently published draft bill of the German federal ministry of finance proposes an incremental repeal of
the solidarity surcharge starting as of the year 2021, which shall effectively benefit lower and middleincome individual taxpayers. Pursuant to the draft bill, the solidarity surcharge shall remain in place for
purposes of the withholding tax, the flat tax regime and the corporate income tax. Again, specific legislative
actions have not yet been initiated.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes, including the effect of any state, local
or church taxes, under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are resident or whose tax
laws apply to them for other reasons.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing payments, such as interest payments, received by an individual Holder of the Notes will be subject
to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial
account with a German financial institution (i.e., a bank, a financial services institution, a securities trading

200


-----

company or a securities trading bank (each, a ‘‘Disbursing Agent’’, auszahlende Stelle)). The term German
financial institution includes a German branch of a foreign financial institution but not a foreign branch of
a German financial institution. The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5%
thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%). If the individual Holder is subject to church tax, a church
tax surcharge will also be withheld. The church tax surcharge is automatically withheld by the Disbursing
Agent, unless the Holder notifies the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt f¨ur Steuern) that it
objects to automatic withholding. In the case of such a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk), the Holder will be
assessed to church tax (if applicable).

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes
(‘‘Accrued Interest’’, _St¨uckzinsen) derived by an individual Holder irrespective of any holding period_
provided the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of
their acquisition. If Notes held or managed in the same custodial account were acquired at different points
in time, the Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes of determining any
capital gains. Where the Notes are acquired and/or sold in a currency other than Euro, the sales/
redemption price and/or the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign
exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively. If interest
claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to
withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption or collection of interest claims if the
Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent
since the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding
tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (including Accrued Interest, if
any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs
of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution
within the European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries, e.g., Switzerland, the
Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco and the Principality
of Andorra.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of
the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual Holder of the Notes via the
Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The
Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon
the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on
investment income in a given year regarding other securities held by the individual Holder in the custodial
account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual Holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent,
the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_
withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted
if the Holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment
(Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent tax office.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate Holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial
partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the
status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing
payments, such as interest payments, are generally subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any
deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same applies where the Notes form part of a German
trade or business (of an individual or a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Interest and capital gains received on the Notes by non-tax residents of Germany are, in general, not
subject to German withholding tax or the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or
capital gain is subject to German taxation (as set forth under ‘‘—Taxation of Current Income and Capital
_Gains—Non Tax Residents’’) and the Notes are held in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent,_

201


-----

withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on
an assessment to tax or under an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection ‘‘Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management is located in Germany).

Income (i.e., interest and capital gains) derived under the Notes held by an individual Holder who is tax
resident in Germany, irrespective of any holding period, is in general subject to German income tax at a
flat tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the
Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). Individual Holders who are tax resident in Germany
are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for married couples and
for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die Eingetragene
Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a
capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual Holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld. To the extent
withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment
process, the individual Holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Notes in
his or her tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where
applicable, church tax thereon). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), an individual
Holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds, must apply for an
assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs. Further, an individual Holder may apply for a
tax assessment on the basis of general rules applicable to him or her if the resulting individual income tax
burden is lower than 25% with any amounts of German tax over-withheld being refunded. The deduction
of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with
respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual Holder realized in the
same or following tax assessment periods. Certain particularities apply based on the decree of the German
Federal Ministry of Finance dated January 18, 2016 (IV C 1—S 2252/08/10004) (as amended) (‘‘Decree’’).

Pursuant to the Decree a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall) and a waiver of a receivable
(Forderungsverzicht), to the extent that the waiver does not qualify as a hidden capital contribution, shall
not be treated as a disposal. Accordingly, losses suffered upon such bad debt loss or waiver are not tax
deductible if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). The same rules should apply
according to the Decree, if the Notes expire worthless so that losses may not be tax deductible at all. In
contrast thereto, the German Federal Fiscal Court (BFH, October 24, 2017—VIII R 13/15) decided that a
finally suffered bad debt loss is tax deductible. The German Federal Fiscal Court did not decide whether
this also applies in case of debt waiver. The new ruling has not been officially acknowledged by the
German Federal Ministry of Finance and, therefore, has not been published in the Federal Tax Gazette
(Bundessteuerblatt). The Regional Tax Office North Rhine-Westphalia has since published guidance that
the ruling should therefore not be used apart from the specific case which was decided by the court, as the
coordination of the supreme tax authorities of the federation and the German states on whether the ruling
shall be published in the Federal Tax Gazette has not taken place yet (Regional Tax Office North RhineWestphalia, information note (income tax) no. 01/2018 dated January 23, 2018). With respect to a
(voluntary) waiver of receivable a lower German fiscal court confirmed the view of the German tax
authorities in a final decision and another lower German fiscal court rejected the jurisdiction of the
German Federal Fiscal Court with respect to the tax deductibility of a bad debt loss. Further decisions in
this context are currently still pending with the German Federal Fiscal Court. In addition, in a recently
published decision by the German Federal Fiscal Court with regard to losses incurred in connection with
knock-out certificates due to the fact of exceeding the knock-out threshold the German Federal Fiscal
Court took the view that such a case (i.e. no payments from the day of exceeding the knock-out threshold)
shall be treated similar to a bad debt loss as a sale at the value zero, so that losses suffered shall also be
deductible for tax purposes (BFH, November 20, 2018—VIII R 37/15).It remains unclear if and to what
extent the German tax authorities will change their position as currently published with respect to the
treatment of capital losses.

202


-----

Furthermore, capital losses might not be recognized by the German tax authorities if the Notes are sold at
a market price which is lower than the transaction costs or if the level of transaction costs is restricted
because of a mutual agreement that the transaction costs are calculated by subtracting a certain amount
from the sales price or if no (or only _de minimis) payments are made to the individual investors on the_
maturity or redemption date of the Notes. This view has however been challenged by the judgement of the
German Federal Fiscal Court published in September 2018 (BFH, June 12, 2018—VIII R 32/16). While
the German tax authorities previously took the position that a disposal (and, as a consequence, a tax loss
resulting from such disposal) shall not be recognized if the Notes are sold at a market price which is lower
than the transaction costs or if the level of transaction costs is restricted because of a mutual agreement
that the transaction costs are calculated by subtracting a certain amount from the sales price, the German
Federal Ministry of Finance has recently published an amendment to the Decree (dated 10 May 2019)
agreeing with the judgement of the German Federal Fiscal Court that the recognition as disposal shall not
depend on the amount of any consideration or the amount of the transaction costs.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate Holder, the withholding tax, if
any, will not settle the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual
or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Where
Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be
taken into account as income. The respective Holder will have to include income and related (business)
expenses in the tax return and the balance will be taxed at the Holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax
levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of
the Holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, will be refunded.
Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and capital gains from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax
(Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz).
If the Holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be
completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non Tax Residents_

This subsection ‘‘—Non Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e.,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management is not located
in Germany).

Interest, including Accrued Interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any)
from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by Holders who are not tax
resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the
business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base
maintained in Germany by the Holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income
(such as income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (unless
the Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German
Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibung)) or
income from profit participating instruments, neither of which should be fulfilled in the view of the Issuer).
Furthermore, the Holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German
withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over-the-counter payment by a German
Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. To the
extent the German source income is subject to German withholding tax, this withholding tax is, in general
final and the German tax liability is satisfied by the tax withheld. Where the German source income is not
subject to German withholding tax or in case Notes form part of the business property of a German
permanent establishment as described in this paragraph above, a tax regime similar to that explained above
under ‘‘Tax Residents’’ applies. Subject to certain requirements, a Holder who is not tax resident in
Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided under an applicable double taxation
treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) and German tax law.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift
tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident
or deemed to be a resident of Germany or in certain cases for German citizens who previously maintained
a residence in Germany. If neither the Holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of
Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless (i) the Notes

203


-----

are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a
permanent representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii), which in the view of the Issuer should
not be the case here, the obligations under the Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs
real estate (unless the Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)).

Should a double tax treaty be applicable in the individual case, however, German taxation provisions may
be restricted thereby.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any notarial fees).
However, under certain conditions, entrepreneurs (for VAT purposes) may opt for a liability to value
added tax with regard to the sale of Notes which would otherwise be tax exempt. Currently, net assets tax
(Verm¨ogensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for
the discussion of Additional Notes (as defined under ‘‘—Additional Notes’’) and does not address the
effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws)
or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the ‘‘Treasury Regulations’’), and
judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
‘‘IRS’’) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be
no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S.
expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies,
traders in securities or currencies, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other
pass through entities and investors in such entities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, U.S.
holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States,
persons holding the Notes as part of a ‘‘straddle’’, ‘‘hedge’’, ‘‘conversion transaction’’ or other integrated
transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules
as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable
financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at
original issue and at their ‘‘issue price’’ (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is
sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or
any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of
which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within
the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or
more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is
in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in

204


-----

such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding the Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal**
**income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local, foreign or**
**other tax laws.**

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances (see, e.g., ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a
_Change of Control’’), we may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and_
interest. We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such
position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such
additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S.
holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder,
unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS
successfully challenged our position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments,
U.S. holders would be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity,
regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any
gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of a Note, and to recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a manner different than that described
below. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment
debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to
the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding
taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a
U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with
such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a U.S. holder is subject to
withholding taxes, such U.S. holder shou¨od consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of relief
from withholding or a refund of any withheld taxes under the U.S.-Germany tax treaty.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the
date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at
such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with
respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposition of the euro so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect
to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will
be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or,
with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the
partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such
accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual
period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on
the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days
of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the
prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest.
The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be
changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income
on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate

205


-----

of exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar
value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss
generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S.
source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be
considered ‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under
U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the
rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk
rules). If a refund of any tax withheld is available under any applicable income tax treaty, the amount of tax
withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income
tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against U.S. federal taxable income). There are
significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such
disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as
interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and
such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder.
The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is
treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis
taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder
will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate
of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such
foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note
that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so
elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by
translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special
election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on
an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S.
holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not
make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are
exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss
generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of
such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest
income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot
rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’. However, upon a
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize

206


-----

any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest)
only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will
be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S.
holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are
generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the Notes and to the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S.
holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such
exemption. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a correct
taxpayer identification number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise
fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Additional Notes_**

The issuer may issue additional notes (‘‘Additional Notes’’) as described under ‘‘Description of Notes’’.
These Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the
original Notes in some cases, may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
such a case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have OID which may adversely affect the market
value of the original Notes of such series if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the
original Notes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to
losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign
currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to
determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including
any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

U.S. holders who are individuals and who own ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’ with an aggregate value
in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an
information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does
not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of
limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related
tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The
Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements,
unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an
entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

207

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the
Notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the United States Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include ‘‘plan assets’’ of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements
(pursuant to Section 3(42) of ERISA and regulations promulgated under ERISA by the U.S. Department
of Labor) (each, an ‘‘ERISA Plan’’). Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in
Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans
(as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code; however, such plans may be subject to non-U.S., federal, state, or local laws or regulations
that are substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (‘‘Similar Laws’’) or which
otherwise affect their ability to invest in the Notes. Any fiduciary of such a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan considering an investment in the Notes (together with ERISA Plans, ‘‘Plans’’) should
determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under such laws or
regulations.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit
certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties.
Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA
Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such
an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in
accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, the Initial
Purchaser, and the Trustee and their respective affiliates (collectively, the ‘‘Transaction Parties’’) is acting,
or will act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.
The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any
particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to
purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction
Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific
purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes
for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each
prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are ‘‘parties in interest’’, within the meaning
of ERISA, or ‘‘disqualified persons’’, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption
is available. Such transactions are referred to as ‘‘prohibited transactions’’ and include, without limitation,
(1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or
exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or
(3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan
assets.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes
by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or
disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406
of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance

208


-----

with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain
exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the
Notes by an ERISA Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to
acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the ERISA Plan.
Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code
for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA Plan. In
addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions
(‘‘PTCEs’’) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be
amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by
independent ‘‘qualified professional asset managers’’), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting life
insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset
managers).

Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of an
ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any
other, PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their
counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any
PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the
notes.

Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain
church plans and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary
responsibility and prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should
consider the impact of Similar Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above,
to the extent applicable.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing ‘‘plan assets’’
of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.
Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have
represented and agreed that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to
acquire and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) (a) the acquisition,
holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and (b) none of the Transaction Parties
has acted as the Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the Plan’s decision
to acquire a Note and none of the Transaction Parties will at any time be relied upon as the Plan’s fiduciary
with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold or transfer a Note

In addition, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note that is an ERISA Plan will be deemed to
represent that (a) none of the Transaction Parties has acted as the Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon
for any advice, with respect to the Plan’s decision to acquire a note and none of the Transaction Parties will
at any time be relied upon as the Plan’s fiduciary with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold
or transfer a Note and (b) the decision to acquire and hold a Note has been made be a duly authorized
fiduciary who (i) is independent (as that term is used in US Code of Federal Regulations 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-21(c)(1), as amended from time to time) of the Transaction Parties, (ii) is a (a) bank as
defined in Section 202 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the ‘‘Advisers Act’’) or similar
institution that is regulated and supervised and subject to periodic examination by a state or federal agency
of the United States, (b) insurance carrier which is qualified under the laws of more than one state of the
United States to perform the services of managing, acquiring or disposing of assets of such a Plan, (c) an
investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act or, if not registered an as investment adviser under
the advisers act by reason of paragraph (1) of section 203a of the Advisers Act, is registered as an

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not
be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation,
administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this
discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the
date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be
imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that
fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with
the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be
applicable.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase
from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. Each of the sales will be made pursuant to a
purchase agreement among the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the
date of the final offering memorandum (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’).

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase
any of them.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may
change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The
Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of
sales into the United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to
investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if the Initial Purchasers default, the
purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the
offering may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to
sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or
guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the
period from the date of the Purchase Agreement until the date falling 120 days after the date of the final
offering memorandum without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes and the Guarantee have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may
not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as
described under ‘‘Important Information’’.

The Initial Purchasers have represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or
the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale
of the Notes. See ‘‘Important Information’’.

The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,

211


-----

contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the
safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply,
through its listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, the Issuer cannot
assure you that the listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the
Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—
_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_
_limited’’._

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is
used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T + 10’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this
Offering Memorandum or the following seven business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who
wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions
permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified
maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution
has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim
a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are
purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or
maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the offering, creating a
syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate
short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making
transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may
stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise
prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities
at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in
_which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited’’. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions_
and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of
these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure
of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at
the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than
the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of
the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment
banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course
of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch, HSBC Bank PLC, UniCredit Bank AG and/or certain of their respective affiliates

212


-----

are mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including under the
Revolving Credit Facility). Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, acts as security agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement and will act as security agent under
the Indenture. In addition, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and certain of its affiliates are arranger and lender
under the Bridge Facility Agreement. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations
of the Notes.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Bridge Facility and accordingly the Initial Purchasers or certain of their
respective affiliates will receive a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Notes.

information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Accordingly, you acknowledge that no
representation or warranty is made by the Initial Purchasers or any person representing the Initial
Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. You represent that you are relying
only on this Offering Memorandum in making your investment decision with respect to the Notes.
You agree that you have had access to such financial and other information concerning the Group and
the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase Notes,
including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information from the Group and the Initial
Purchasers.

(5) You represent that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor

state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the
property of that investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to
your or their ability to resell the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor

the property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s control and to
compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global note, the
Resale Restriction Period (as defined below) may continue until one year after the Issuer, or any affiliate
of the Issuer, was the owner of such note or an interest in such global note, and so may continue
indefinitely.

(6) You also acknowledge that:

or any predecessor of the Notes (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Period’’), and will not apply after the
applicable Resale Restriction Period ends;

periodic information to holders of the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports’’.

Copies of the Issuer’s organizational documents, the Indenture relating to the Notes and our most recent
consolidated financial statements published by us may be inspected and obtained at the office of the Paying
Agent during normal business hours for a period of 14 days following the grant of listing of the Notes. See
‘‘Listing and General Information’’. Copies of such documents will also be available from the Issuer upon
written request to the address of the Issuer on and after the grant of listing of the Notes.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and the Parent Guarantor are incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of
Germany.

All of our directors, officers and other executives are neither residents nor citizens of the United States.
Furthermore, the majority of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be
possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons, the Issuer or
the Parent Guarantor or to enforce against them, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor judgments of U.S.
courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws despite the fact
that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor have appointed, or will
appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible for investors to effect service
of process certain jurisdictions provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and any relevant rules of
court applicable in such jurisdictions are complied with.

**_Germany_**

The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the
United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not
automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or
state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and
enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including
the following:

- U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

- the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of noncompliance with such requirement,
(i) the defendant does not invoke such noncompliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the
proceedings;

- the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German
court or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized
in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment does not contradict any such
judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

- the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this
context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment
awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as
treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material
principles of German law;

- the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

- the judgment is final under U.S. federal or state law.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after
having received an _exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above_
principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights
generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

221


-----

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of
aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of
several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties
to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and
the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any
proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States.
Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a
German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German
court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment
rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEE AND THE**
**COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations regarding the European Union and
the Federal Republic of Germany. The descriptions below are only a summary and do not purport to be
complete or to discuss all insolvency law considerations that may affect the enforceability of the obligations
of the Issuer or any Guarantor. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes’’.

**European Union**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018, the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’) was published in the
Official Gazette of the European Union. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings
that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

**_Main insolvency proceedings_**

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union
(the ‘‘Member State’’) (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is
situated. The ‘‘center of main interests’’ is defined as ‘‘the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties’’. Pursuant to
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the center of main interests of a company or legal person is
presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another
Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is
located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment
of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s
actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that
other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception
as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of
main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is
carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial
correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a
Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under
the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to
the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State
within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall
have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked
with them, such as avoidance actions.

**_Secondary insolvency proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
opened in other Member States. If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one Member State
(other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member
State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ‘‘secondary’’ or ‘‘territorial’’ insolvency proceedings
only in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such other Member State.
Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency
Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial
proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main
insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main
proceedings. ‘‘Establishment’’ is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has

223


-----

carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings
are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in
which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency
proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and
either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of
main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such
establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective
Member State’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain
exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has_
assumed jurisdiction for the respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case
may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court
of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in
another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject
to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State
or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency
proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member
State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which
secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must
undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which
the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the
assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified
majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the
undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency
proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings,
refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general
interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may
stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided
that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request
from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three
months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process
of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings
will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be
challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it
is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may
affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any
other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective
companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and

224


-----

there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied
in relation to one another.

**_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_**

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event
that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened.
Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with
any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the
extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also
cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another
member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration
of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of
interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not
incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer and the Parent Guarantor are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered
offices in Germany and, except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of their
assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor under
the laws of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings.
Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with
German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the
centre of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the Issuer or
the Parent Guarantor may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in
particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to
your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, _inter alia, in respect of_
priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances
priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit
the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising
under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite
the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate
insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the
part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other
insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and
liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group
insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bew¨altigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on
April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency
proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency
proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key
amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the
appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated;
(iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ‘‘coordination proceedings’’
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ‘‘coordination insolvency administrator’’
(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a ‘‘coordination plan’’ (Koordinationsplan).

225


-----

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
_ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency_
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts
as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its
assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly
likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich) at least for the current and the subsequent fiscal year (positive
_Fortf¨uhrungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its_
due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company
can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demn¨achst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor
to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG),
a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a company with limited
liability (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as
personally liable shareholder—such as the Issuer—becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the
management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the
opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three (3) weeks after
the mandatory insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, occurred. Non-compliance with
these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal
law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the
Notes, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) is a valid
insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments
obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain
prognosis period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor is likely to not be able to pay its debts as and when they
fall due.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorl¨aufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures
taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In
addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an_
insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the
debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that no
circumstances are known which lead to the expectation that debtor-in-possession status will place the
creditors at a disadvantage. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court
must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) to form a view on
a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to
be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the
preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the
court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure
that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it should and
usually does comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the
small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator
are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which may include the continuation of
the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess
whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court
orders the opening (Er¨offnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (er¨offnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if
certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least
the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the
insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the
costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not
necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the
insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets

226


-----

of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) only
being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first
creditors’ assembly (erste Gl¨aubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of
votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual
becoming the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e.,
sufficiently qualified, business- experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new
financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities
incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the
residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if
any) also being as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such
opening of formal insolvency proceedings against the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant
subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

- if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and
dispose of the assets of the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries would generally
pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency
estate;

- if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the Issuer,
such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of the
Issuer, such Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null
and void by operation of law;

- if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the Issuer’s, such Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that
would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of
law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and

- claims against the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in
accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ‘‘escape clauses’’
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the
occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene K¨undigungsrechte
_oder L¨osungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_
whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination
rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to agreements that are not governed by
German law.

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to
assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German
insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their
individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance
with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action
(Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once
insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to
enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however,
secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of
the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the
insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has
the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential
rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title

227


-----

(Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the
enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets
(Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate,
usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus value added tax (if any), are disbursed to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.
With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the
creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegl¨aubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as
well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of
unsecured insolvency creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after
realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there
is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential
claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the
relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who
becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank
senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency
proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated
creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under
‘‘Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims’’.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the Issuer’s, any Guarantor’s or any of their relevant
subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s
business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken
based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the Issuer,
such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in
accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of
dissenting creditors or the debtor can-under certain circumstances-be crammed down). If the debtor is a
corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be
included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer or
issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent
illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a
debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile
(offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency
plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security
may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency
court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an
individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless
the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or
impartial).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such
time unless and until the insolvency administrators opt for performance.

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are
successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other
benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the
insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the

228


-----

circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the
Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of
Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing
credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by
an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully voided
(angefochten), the holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes
or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments
have already been made under the Notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had
been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of
the Notes, as applicable, would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes, as applicable,
without preference in insolvency proceedings.

Against this background, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which term
includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in
particular in the following cases:

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity
or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled, if such act was taken (i) during
the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after
such filing, (ii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was
illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was
taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that compellingly suggest such detrimental effect);

- a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of
such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to
such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction;

- any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a
third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

- any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of
prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vors¨atzliche Gl¨aubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the
act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or
enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to
four years; ‘‘knowledge by the beneficiary of the act’’ in terms of such provision is presumed if the
beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and that the
relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a
creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was
entitled, the ‘‘knowledge by the beneficiary of the act’’ is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the
debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged
the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to

229


-----

deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at
this time;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier
than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other
party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the
contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘‘affiliated party’’ includes, subject
to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and
shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor,
and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing
persons;

- any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder, for repayment
of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place
during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of
such petition; or

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to
a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder B¨urge) (in which case the shareholder must
compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or
intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge
of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or
imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With
respect to an ‘‘affiliated party’’, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge’’.

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a ‘‘cash transaction’’
and may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargesch¨aftsprivileg).

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement
order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the
relevant security right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal
insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the
voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

The German insolvency laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019, the
Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the ‘‘Directive’’) has been adopted.
The Directive has been published on June 26, 2019 in the Official Journal of the European Union, from
which date the member states will have approximately two years to implement the substantive parts of the
Directive in their national legislation, although a one-year extension can be granted. The Directive aims to
put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance
frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their
length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the Directive is the introduction
of a preventive restructuring framework. The Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by
the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization).

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs
incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines,
regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a
criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous
performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for repayment of a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to
such a loan.

**_Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature
and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the
secured claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will
automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned
independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is
assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security
interest.

The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however
not a creditor under the Notes. The holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes. In order to
allow the holders to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so-called ‘‘parallel debt’’
obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the
holders’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same
time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor under the Notes and the Guarantee (the
‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the
corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt,
a claim against the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal
concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it
cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or
mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent
to enforce the collateral may be restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the
Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may
successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the
secured claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory
security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

**CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald**

**Selected Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**

**as of and for the period ended 30 September 2019**

**1. General information**

CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, headquartered in Greifswald, Ziegelhof 24, is the parent
company of the CHEPLAPHARM Group and a limited liability company under German law. The
company is registered in the Commercial Register of the Local Court of Stralsund under the
number B 5896.

CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH (hereinafter also referred to as CHEPLAPHARM,
CHEPLAPHARM Group or Group) was founded in Freiburg in 1998 and relocated its headquarters to
Mesekenhagen in 2003. CHEPLAPHARM’s management as well as its headquarters have been in the
Hanseatic city of Greifswald since October 2018.

The CHEPLAPHARM Group’s business operations mainly consist of the worldwide distribution of
‘‘Specialty Pharma’’, which includes branded pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, medical devices
and cosmetics. The range comprises primarily prescription medicines for cardiology, emergency medicine,
haematology, addiction medicine and urology as well as over-the-counter medicines, care and medical
devices.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the
information and disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements, and should be read
in conjunction with the Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH’s annual Consolidated financial statements as of
31 December 2018.

In the condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at 30 September 2019, the accounting and
valuation principles and the consolidation principles applied in the consolidated financial statements as at
31 December 2018, continued unchanged except for the revised or new standards and interpretations
described below that are relevant for the consolidated financial statements of CHEPLAPHARM, which
were to be applied in the EU from 1 January 2019.

IFRS11; IAS 12; IAS 23

The application of the pronouncements presented in the table above has the following effects on the
presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial
statements of CHEPLAPHARM.

**IFRS 16—Leases**

IFRS 16 was published in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 Leases and all interpretations relating to lease
accounting. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
leases and requires lessees to recognize all leases on a single model similar to the accounting for finance
leases under IAS 17. The new standard contains two exceptions to the recognition obligation for lessees:
leases for low-value assets and short-term leases with a maximum term of twelve months.

At the beginning of the lease, the lessee recognizes a liability to pay lease payments (lease liability) and an
asset for the granted right to use the leased asset during the term of the lease (right of use of the leased

**1. General information (Continued)**

asset). Lessees must separately recognize the interest expense for the lease liability and the depreciation
expense for the right of use of the leased asset. In addition, lessees are required to revalue the lease
liability when certain events occur (for example, a change in the lease term or a change in future lease
payments due to a change in the index or interest rate used to determine the lease payments). The amount
of the revaluation of the lease liability will generally be recognized by lessees as an adjustment to the right
of use of the leased asset.

For lessors, IFRS 16 will essentially result in no changes compared with the currently valid IAS 17. They
will continue to classify all leases according to the classification principles of IAS 17 and distinguish
between two types of leases: operating leases and finance leases.

CHEPLAPHARM applies the standard as of 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective approach.
Accordingly, the comparative information for the financial year 2018 has not been restated. The previous
assessment of the existence of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 was retained for existing
contracts as at 1 January 2019. CHEPLAPHARM has made use of the optional exemptions to not apply
recognition rules to short-term leases and low-value lease contracts as part of the initial application.

The Group is exclusively a lessee. The significant leases in accordance with IFRS 16, which were not
already treated as finance leases until 31 December 2018, relate to company cars and an office container.

The following table shows the reconciliation of liabilities from leasing as at 1 January 2019:

**kEUR**

Minimum lease payments under operating leases as at 31 December 2018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 962
Application of exemption for short-term leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �685

Liabilities from leasing as at 1 January 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 262

As at 1 January 2019, liabilities from leasing in the amount of A 262K and rights to property, plant and
equipment in the same amount were recognized. An adjustment effect in equity did not arise.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate for the lease liabilities recognized as at 1 January 2019
was 5.0% p.a.

The application of the other new or revised IFRS standards and interpretations had no significant impact
on the presentation of the net assets, financial position and income statement in the consolidated financial
statements of CHEPLAPHARM. However, they will partly lead to additional information.

Other than the matters described above, the accounting and valuation methods are applied consistently to
all financial years presented in the financial statements. Expenses and income that usually accrue at the
end of a financial year have been periodized for interim reporting purposes.

The carrying amounts of the financial instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheet correspond
to their fair values. The securities as well as non-current and current receivables and liabilities from
derivative financial instruments are valued at fair value.

The derivative financial instruments are exclusively interest-rate-related transactions and OTC products,
i.e. non-exchange-traded products. The derivative financial instruments are valued at their market values
determined by banks. These are values based on internal risk models, which are determined using
recognized mathematical methods. The carrying amounts of derivatives correspond to the market values.

As at 31 December 2018 and as at 30 September 2019, the fair values of the derivatives are derived from
observable market data and are therefore attributable to hierarchy level 2. The securities are valued at the
stock exchange price and are therefore attributable to hierarchy level 1.

**Selected Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**as of and for the period ended 30 September 2019**

**1. General information (Continued)**

All other financial assets are held by CHEPLAPHARM to collect the contractual cash flows, which are
solely repayments and interest payments on the outstanding nominal capital. As a result, these financial
assets are measured at amortized cost in accordance with IFRS 9.

Compared to the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2018, no changes were made to the
consolidated interim financial statements.

Income tax expense was calculated on the basis of the results of the companies included and the current
tax rate as the best estimate. Deferred taxes on temporary differences and loss carry forwards were valued
at the applicable deferred tax rates.

The interim consolidated financial statements were neither audited in accordance with section 317 HGB
nor subjected to a review.

**2. Scope of consolidation**

In addition to CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH as parent company, the consolidated interim
financial statements include all major domestic and foreign affiliated companies.

The scope of consolidation has changed since 31 December 2018 as follows:

As a result of the demerger and acquisition agreement of 25.07.2019, the shares in Walter Ritter
GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg, were transferred to Braun Beteiligungs GmbH, Greifswald, the shareholder
of CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH (related party), without any consideration. As a result, the
companies Walter Ritter GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg, W. R. Pharmaceuticals Vertriebs-GmbH, Hamburg,
Sanavita Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Hamburg, and RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH, Steinau an der Stra�e,
were deconsolidated as of 25 July 2019.

Glenwood LLC, Englewood, New Jersey, USA, was liquidated in September 2019 and deconsolidated
accordingly.

As of 30 September 2019, the scope of consolidation includes, in addition to CHEPLAPHARM as parent
company, the subsidiaries Cheplapharm France SAS, Levallois Perret, France, und Glenwood
Verwaltung II UG, Mesekenhagen.

**3. Significant events and transactions**

The first three quarters of 2019 were characterized by the further acquisitions of product licenses and
trademarks. In January 2019, approvals were acquired for the products Dormicum (EUR 23,5 mio.) and
Lexotan (EUR 200,0 mio.). In September 2019, the transfer of approvals for the product Losec
(EUR 221,7 mio.) followed. The acquisition of these intangible assets resulted in an increase of Drug
licences and Trademarks by EUR 445,2 million as well as an increase of the respective Other financial
debts.

Glenwood LLC’s business operations were discontinued in September 2019. The group recognized a loss
of EUR 2,1 mio. from discontinuing the business.

The investments were financed through a new Term Loan B, which replaced the existing Term Loan B. The
new Term Loan B has improved terms compared to the previous one and an additional EUR 150 million
was raised.

Due to the investments in intangibles, there was a significant increase in revenues and cost of materials
compared to the comparative period of the prior year. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation
and amortization.

The Result of Operations increased by EUR 50,2 million compared to the comparative period of the prior
year.

**Selected Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**as of and for the period ended 30 September 2019**

**3. Significant events and transactions (Continued)**

As a result of the acquisitions of further intangible assets, there is an associated increase in financial
liabilities and accordingly of interest expenses as well.

Interest income is impacted by a gain (EUR 15,8 mio.) from the revaluation of financial liabilities. The
revaluation is associated to a change of the effective interest rate of the Term Loan B, which resulted in a
decrease of this liability (note: the changes to the Term Loan B were not deemed a substantive
modification in accordance with IFRS.).

In the nine month period ended September 30, 2019, the Company reported an income tax expense of
EUR 18,1 million, which mainly resulted from current income tax. In the comparative period of the prior
year the company reported an income tax benefit of EUR 3,2 million.

**4. Significant transactions with related parties**

Related persons are the managing directors, their family members as well as the shareholder Braun
Beteiligungs GmbH and its shareholders.

Regarding the transfer of shares in Walter Ritter GmbH & Co. KG and its subsidiaries, see the section
‘‘Scope of consolidation’’.

As at the reporting date, in addition to outstanding receivables from and payable to affiliated persons, at
the prevailing market interest rates, there are no other significant transactions with related persons.

**5. Seasonality**

The business of CHEPLAPHARM is not subject to any significant seasonal influences.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**for the Financial Year 2018**

**1. General Notes (Continued)**

The financial year of CHEPLAPHARM and its subsidiaries is the calendar year. The consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in euro. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are stated in
thousands of euros (kEUR). For computational reasons, rounding differences to the exact mathematical
values may rise in tables and notes.

The balance sheet has been classified according to maturity; assets and liabilities are classified by noncurrent—for maturities of more than one year—and current. The nature of expense format has been
applied to the statement of profit and loss.

The consolidated financial statements of CHEPLAPHARM were approved by the managing directors for
disclosure purposes on 4. December 2019.

**2. Policies and Methods**

All IFRSs issued by the IASB and valid at the time the consolidated financial statements on hand were
prepared and applied by CHEPLAPHARM were adopted by the European Commission for application in
the EU. The consolidated financial statements prepared by CHEPLAPHARM thus comply with the IFRS,
as adopted by the EU.

The accounting and valuation methods which we applied are generally consistent with those applied in the
prior year, with the following exceptions:

**In the reporting year, CHEPLAPHARM applied the new and revised IFRSs and Interpretations listed**
**below. The application of these Standards and Interpretations did not have any major impact on the**
Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance. However, they partly led to
additional disclosures.

The detailed presentation is restricted to those Standards and Interpretations which are on principle
applicable at the level of CHEPLAPHARM:

**IFRS 9—Financial Instruments**

In July 2014, the IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which supersedes
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all earlier versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9
combines the three project phases for the accounting for financial instruments ‘‘classification and
measurement’’, ‘‘impairment’’, and ‘‘hedge accounting’’. IFRS 9 contains revised guidelines on
classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new model of expected credit losses
for computing the impairment of financial assets, as well as the new general hedge accounting
requirements. It also supersedes the guidelines concerning recognition and derecognition of financial
instruments under IAS 39.

IFRS 9 is applicable for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. With the exception of hedge
accounting, this Standard is retroactively applicable, but comparative information is not required to be
adjusted. The requirements on hedge accounting are generally prospectively applicable with few
exceptions.

The Group adopted this new Standard as of 1 January 2018. The prior year figures are not adjusted in
accordance with the transitional regulations under IFRS 9. The effect of initial application of IFRS 9 as of
1 January 2018 has been recognized in equity without profit or loss impact.

The effects of initial application of IFRS 9 are stated below:

(a) Classification and Measurement

IFRS 9 includes three important classification categories for financial assets: ‘‘measured at amortized cost
(AC)’’, ‘‘measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)’’, as well as ‘‘measured at fair value

through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)’’. The Standard eliminates the categories of IAS 39: ‘‘loans
and receivables (LaR)’’, ‘‘held to maturity (HtM)’’, as well as ‘‘financial assets held for trading (FAHfT)’’.

The initial application of IFRS 9 had the following effects on the classification of financial assets and
financial liabilities:

objective is to realize contractually agreed cash flows, and if these cash flows solely constitute interest

**2. Policies and Methods (Continued)**

payments and repayments of the outstanding principal. At CHEPLAPHARM Group level, these are
mainly trade receivables, cash at bank, and specific loans granted to non-affiliated companies. Amortized
cost is determined according to the effective interest method.

All further financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss at CHEPLAPHARM Group
level. Gains and losses from fair value changes are directly recognized through profit or loss. These
financial assets are mainly investments and securities. These equity instruments are generally required to
be measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9. For equity instruments, IFRS 9
grants the option to alternatively disclose changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. The Group
does not exercise this option, measuring equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss.

(b) Impairments

The requirements on recognition of impairments of financial assets, which, in accordance with IFRS 9, are
based on an expected loss model (so-called ‘‘expected credit loss model’’), have fundamentally been
revised and include considerable judgments concerning the issue as to how expected credit losses are
influenced by changes in economic factors. Other than under IAS 39, financial assets are required to be
classified by different risk categories depending on historical and future expected default probabilities and
risk provision is required to already be made before default events occur.

At CHEPLAPHARM Group level, an impairment for expected credit losses is recognized for financial
assets recognized at amortized cost, with the simplified impairment model being applied for trade
receivables and impairments regularly being measured in the amount of credit losses expected to be
incurred over the term. The credit losses are determined on the basis of an item-by-item analysis of trade
receivables, taking into account delinquencies.

For all other financial assets within the scope of application of the IFRS 9 impairment model, 12-month
credit losses are measured unless the default risk of a financial instrument increased significantly since its
initial recognition. If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly, impairment losses in the
amount of the credit loss expected over the term are also recognized. For this purpose, it is regularly
examined whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk is
low, it is assumed that it has not significantly increased.

A financial asset continues to be directly written down if, after appropriate assessment, it is not expected to
be fully or partly realizable.

The initial application of the IFRS 9 impairment model has the following conversion effects for
CHEPLAPHARM Group:

**Reconciliation of impairments from IAS 39 to IFRS 9**

**Impairment loss** **Impairment loss**
**under IAS 39** **under IFRS 9**
**as at 31 Dec.** **Expected credit** **as at 1 Jan.** **Classification under**
**Classification under IAS 39** **2017** **losses** **2018** **IFRS 9**
**kEUR** **kEUR** **kEUR**
**Trade receivables**
Loans and receivables (LaR) . . . . . . 1,318 267 1,585 At amortized cost

No impairment losses had to be taken into account for the other assets allocable to the measurement
category ‘‘at amortized cost’’.

As a result of the changes made in accordance with IFRS 9, the retained profits brought forward as at
1 January 2018 were adjusted accordingly in the amount of kEUR 267, excluding deferred taxes.

**2. Policies and Methods (Continued)**

(c) Hedge Accounting

On 1 January 2018, there were derivative financial instruments (see note 20). The derivative financial
instruments are not used as part of an effective hedging relationship. Therefore, these financial
instruments were recognized at fair value through profit or loss both in accordance with IAS 39 and
IFRS 9.

(d) Disclosures

The initial application of the Standard requires additional explanatory disclosures in the notes to the
financial statements.

Overall, the initial application of IFRS 9 as of 1 January 2018 has no major effects on the assets, liabilities,
financial position, and financial performance of CHEPLAPHARM Group.

**IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

IFRS 15 was published in May 2014 and introduces a new model of revenue recognition with five analysis
steps, which is applicable to any revenue under contracts with customers. The core principle of this
Standard is that an entity is required to recognize revenue, when the time goods or services are transferred
to customers, in the amount of the consideration which the entity can reasonably expect to receive for the
transfer of these goods or services. The principles under IFRS 15 provide a structured approach for
measuring and recognizing revenue. The scope of application of this Standard covers all types of industries
and entities and therefore supersedes all existing regulations which related to the area of revenue
recognition (IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs,
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers,
and SIC 31 Revenue—Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services). Compared to the revenue
recognition standards presently applicable, the adoption of this new Standard requires more estimates and
judgments because the amount of revenue to be recognized is determined by the amount of the
consideration which the entity can reasonably expect to receive for the transfer of the goods or services.

At CHEPLAPHARM Group level, IFRS 15 was applied according to the modified retrospective approach
as of 1 January 2018. Therefore, the adjustments to the requirements under IFRS 15 were recognized in
the opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2018. The accounting and recognition methods of the prior year
were not adjusted and continue to meet the requirements under IAS 18.

The business activities of CHEPLAPHARM Group mainly consist in distribution of branded
pharmaceuticals, food supplements, medical products and cosmetics (hereafter referred to as ‘‘products’’),
with CHEPLAPHARM Group acting as a principal. Revenue under contracts with customers under which
the sale of goods constitutes the sole performance obligation is recognized at the time when the power to
dispose of the assets passes to the customer. This is usually the case at the time of delivery. Delivery is
deemed to be completed when the power of disposal associated to title passed to the buyer in accordance
with the contractual agreements, the consideration has been determined, and settlement of the account
receivable is probable. Revenue is measured in the amount of the consideration received or to be received.
The application of IFRS 15 did not lead to any changes in revenue recognition compared to the previous
procedure.

The contracts on sale of pharmaceuticals concluded at CHEPLAPHARM Group level often provide for
rebates. The Group recognizes revenue from sale of pharmaceuticals at the fair value of the remuneration
received or of the account receivable less returns, price rebates and discounts. If revenue cannot be reliably
measured, it is cut off as long as the uncertainty ceases to exist. Under IFRS 15, such contractual
arrangements lead to the fact that the remuneration is variable and has to be estimated at the time the
contract is concluded. To avoid overstatement of revenues realized, IFRS 15 requires that the variable
consideration is only recognized to the extent, that it is highly probable that a subsequent significant
reversal of the revenue recognized will not occur. Since rebates can normally directly be allocated to
specific revenue and be reliably estimated at CHEPLAPHARM Group level, there are no resulting

F-25

**CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald/Germany**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**for the Financial Year 2018**

**2. Policies and Methods (Continued)**

changes in revenue recognition through IFRS 15 compared to IAS 18. Deferred rebates are disclosed
under trade payables.

The Group has concluded consignment agreements with dealers. Under IFRS 15, the time of revenue
realization is determined according to the ‘‘control’’ concept in these cases. This concept is specified in
more detail in IFRS 15.33. According to this concept, control is deemed to have been gained, if others are
‘‘prevented from directing the use of and obtaining the benefits from the asset’’. The Group’s analysis of its
consignment agreements disclosed that revenue has to be continued to be recognized at the time
pharmaceuticals are delivered to end customers. Therefore, the application of IFRS 15 has no adjustment
effect.

IFRS 15 requires more disclosures in the consolidated financial statements than the previous Standards.
Thus, quantitative and qualitative disclosures are required to be made in respect of the classification of
revenues, concerning performance obligations and contract balances, as well as concerning significant
judgments.

Overall, the initial application of IFRS 15 at CHEPLAPHARM Group level leads to reclassifications in
the consolidated balance sheet and to further disclosures in the notes to the financial statements, but does
not result in changes in equity as at 1 January 2018. New is specifically the disclosure of contract liabilities.
IFRS 15 includes requirements on the disclosure of over performance and performance obligations
existing at contract level. These are assets and liabilities under customer contracts that arise independently
from the ratio of the entity’s performance to the customer’s payment. Consequently, a contract liability is
the obligation of an entity to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received (or
is to receive) a consideration from this customer. In compliance with these requirements, reclassifications
were made from the balance sheet item other liabilities to contract liabilities. Contract liabilities arise from
payments received on account of contracts that are in the scope of application of IFRS 15.

**Clarifications Concerning IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

In April 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published the final clarifications
concerning its new Standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The related changes clarify implementation issues. These issues relate to the identification of performance
obligations, the application guidelines for principal/agent relationships and licenses for intellectual
property (IP) as well as transitional provisions. In addition, the purpose of the changes is to ensure a more
uniform procedure in implementing IFRS 15 and to reduce the costs and complexity associated with its
application.

For details on the effects on the Group, see the statements regarding IFRS 15.

**IFRIC 22—Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration**

In December 2016, the IASB published IFRIC 22. This Interpretation covers transactions in foreign
currency if an entity recognizes a non-monetary asset or a non-monetary liability which arises from an
advance payment or advance receipt of a consideration before the entity recognizes the related asset,
income or expense. The time of the transaction for the purposes of determining the exchange rate is the
initial recognition of the non-monetary asset arising from the advance payment or of the non-monetary
liability arising from deferred income. If there are several advance payments or receipts, a transaction time
is determined for every payment and every receipt. This Interpretation is not applicable if an entity
measures the related asset, income or expense at fair value at the time of initial recognition or at the fair
value of the consideration received or paid at a time other than the time of initial recognition of the nonmonetary asset or of the non-monetary liability. Furthermore, the Interpretation is not required to be
applied to income taxes, insurance contracts and pension liability insurance contracts.

CHEPLAPHARM Group prospectively applied IFRIC 22 as of 1 January 2018 for the first time to all
assets, income and expenses that are within the scope of application of this Interpretation and that were
initially recognized on or after 1 January 2018. The application of this Interpretation has no major effects
on the Group.

**The IASB published the Standards and Interpretations listed below which have already been implemented**
**into EU law, but had not yet been mandatorily applicable in the financial year. CHEPLAPHARM does not**
apply these Standards and Interpretations early. The detailed presentation is restricted to such Standards
and Interpretations which might on principle be relevant at CHEPLAPHARM Group level in the future:

**IFRS 16—Leases**

In January 2016, the IASB published the new Standard on recognition of leases, which supersedes the
previous Standard IAS 17. IFRS 16 defines the principles for recognizing, measuring, presenting, and
disclosing leases and requires lessees to recognize all leases according to a single model similar to
accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. For lessees, this Standard provides that the right to use the
leased asset and a corresponding leasing liability mandatorily have to be recognized for most leases.
However, for lessors there are only minor changes in comparison with the classification of, and accounting
for, leases under IAS 17. Under IFRS 16, both lessees and lessors are required to provide extended
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. IFRS 16 is applicable from financial years beginning on
or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is admissible, is, however, only permitted if the entity also applies
IFRS 15. Lessees applying this new Standard for the first time are permitted to choose either full
retrospective recognition or modified retrospective recognition. The transitional provisions under IFRS 16
concede certain transitional reduced disclosure requirements.

CHEPLAPHARM Group intends to adopt this new Standard as of its official effective date, making use of
modified retrospective recognition, as well as further optional reduced disclosure requirements.
CHEPLAPHARM Group is generally a lessee. The new Standard is not expected to have any significant
effects on CHEPLAPHARM Group because CHEPLAPHARM has only entered into an insignificant
scope of obligations under leases. Therefore, there are only minor payment obligations for operating
leases.

Payment obligations for operating leases are previously only required to be disclosed in the notes to the
financial statements. In the future, the rights and obligations resulting from these leases are, however,
required to be recognized as an asset (right to use the leased asset) and as a liability (leasing liability),
respectively, on the balance sheet. In the statement of profit and loss, the expense related to operating
leases has previously been disclosed under the item ‘‘other operating expenses’’. In the future,
amortization of the right of use and interest expenses for leasing liabilities will be disclosed instead.

In the statement of cash flows, payments for operating leases have previously been disclosed under cash
flows from operating activities. In the future, they will be classified by interest payments and repayments.
While interest payments continue to be disclosed under cash flows from operating activities, repayments
will be allocated to cash flows from financing activities.

The Company also elected to not apply the measurement requirements of the standard to leases where the
term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application as a practical expedient upon transition.

The amount of the rights of use and corresponding financial liabilities required to be capitalized at
CHEPLAPHARM Group level as of 1 January 2019 as a result of the application of IFRS 16 amounts to
mEUR 0.3. The effects on the financial performance and the cash flow statement are immaterial.

**IFRS Improvements (2015-2017)**

These improvements on 2015-2017 IFRSs constitute a joint Standard, which was published in December
2017 and addresses changes to various IFRSs which are applicable for financial years beginning on or after
1 January 2019. These IFRS improvements include the following revisions:

- IFRS 3: Clarification that an entity gaining control over a business which constitutes a joint activity is
required to meet the requirements on successive business combinations, including the remeasurement
at fair value of previously held shares in assets and liabilities of the joint activity, with the acquirer
remeasuring its entire share previously held in the joint activity.

- IFRS 11: A party which holds a share in a joint activity, but does not share in its joint control might
gain joint control over such joint activity whose activity constitutes a business within the meaning of
IFRS 3. The changes specify that the shares previously held in this joint activity do not have to be
remeasured.

- IAS 12: Clarification that the income tax consequences of dividends are rather related to past
transactions which led to distributable profits than to distributions to shareholders. Therefore, an
entity recognizes the income tax consequences of dividends, depending on where the past transactions
have originally been recognized, either in the statement of profit and loss, in other comprehensive
income or in equity.

- IAS 23: Clarification that an entity is required to treat borrowings which were originally raised for
developing a qualified asset as an element of general external funds if the entire activities that are
necessary for getting this asset ready for its intended use or sale have basically been completed.

CHEPLAPHARM Group intends to adopt this revision Standard as of its official effective date. This joint
Standard is not expected to have any major effects on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position, and
financial performance.

**IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments**

In June 2017, the IASB published IFRIC 23. This Interpretation is applicable to account for income taxes
under IAS 12 if there are uncertainties in respect of the income tax treatment. It does not apply to taxes or
levies that are not within the scope of application of IAS 12 and does not contain any requirements on
interest and delay penalties in connection with uncertain tax treatments. This Interpretation specifically
deals with the following issues:

- Decision as to whether an entity should assess uncertain tax treatments on an item-by-item basis,

- Assumptions made by an entity in respect of the examination of tax treatments through the tax
authorities,

- Determination of taxable profit (taxable loss), of the tax assessment bases, of unrealized tax losses, of
unrealized tax credits, and of tax rates,

- Taking into account of changes in facts and circumstances.

An entity has to determine whether each uncertain tax treatment is assessed separately or together with
one or several other uncertain tax treatments. The approach chosen for this purpose should enable a better
prediction in respect of the elimination of the uncertainty. This Interpretation is applicable for reporting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. However, it is possible to take advantage of certain
transitional reduced disclosure requirements.

CHEPLAPHARM Group intends to apply this Interpretation as of the official effective date. Since the
Group operates in an international environment, this Interpretation might have effects on the consolidated
financial statements. The Group performs further processes and procedures in order to obtain the
information that is necessary for applying the Interpretation on time.

**2. Policies and Methods (Continued)**

The new regulations listed below are not applicable to CHEPLAPHARM Group and will therefore not
impact on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance:

- Revision of IAS 19—Plan Changes, Curtailments or Settlements,

- Revision of IAS 28—Non-current Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures,

- Revision of IFRS 9—Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation.

**The IASB published the Standards and Interpretations listed below which had not yet been mandatorily**
**applicable in the financial year 2018. These Standards and Interpretations have not been recognized by the EU to**
**date and are not applied by CHEPLAPHARM Group. The detailed presentation is restricted to such**
Standards and Interpretations which might on principle be applicable to CHEPLAPHARM Group in the
future:

**Revised Framework Concept and Adjustments of Cross References in IFRSs**

In March 2018, the comprehensively revised Framework Concept was published by the IASB. It immediately
entered into force at the time of publication. This Framework Concept is not subject to the endorsement
process. In this context, adjustments have also been made to cross references in the IFRSs to the Framework
Concept and to interpretations of the Framework Concept. This may, for example, have effects on previously
applied accounting and measurement methods which have been developed within the scope of IAS 8.
However, these are subject to the endorsement process. The revisions are prospectively applicable on or after 1
January 2020. Earlier application is permitted if all related adjustments are applied.

The revision of the Framework Concept is not expected to have any effects on CHEPLAPHARM Group’s
assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance.

**Revision of IFRS 3 Definition of a Business**

The revisions of IFRS 3 Definition of a Business were published in October 2018. Their purpose is to
support entities in determining whether a transaction has to be accounted for as a business combination or
as an acquisition of assets. They specify the minimum requirements for a business (existence of input
factors and of a substantial process which essentially permits to generate outputs). The previously
necessary assessment as to whether market players are able to replace missing elements in this process is
omitted. Supplementary guidance is to help to assess whether a process acquired is substantial.
Furthermore, the definitions of business and output have been constricted in such a way that these are
required to constitute services provided for customers. In addition, an optional concentration test, which is
to permit a simplified assessment, is introduced. To illustrate the application of the revisions, explanatory
examples have additionally been included. The revisions will be prospectively applicable on or after
1 January 2020. Early application is permitted.

These revisions are not expected to have any effects on CHEPLAPHARM Group’s assets, liabilities,
financial position, and financial performance.

**Revisions of IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Materiality**

The revisions of IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Materiality were published in October 2018. Information is
material if the omission, incorrect presentation or obscuring of this information might reasonably influence
the decision of the primary users. This new definition of materiality takes into account obscuring of
information as a measure of materiality in the area of disclosures for the first time. It aims at the primary
users of financial statements as defined in the Framework Concept since 2010. Furthermore, information
must reasonably be able to influence decisions in order to be material. The revisions were made in order to
adapt the definition to the statements regarding materiality in the 2018 Framework Concept and to
generally facilitate their application. The revisions will be prospectively applicable for financial years
beginning on or after 1 January 2020.

**2. Policies and Methods (Continued)**

These revisions are not expected to have any effects on CHEPLAPHARM Group’s assets, liabilities,
financial position, and financial performance.

The new regulations listed below are not applicable to the Group and will therefore not impact on the
Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance:

- IFRS 17—Insurance Contracts.

The requirements of all Standards and Interpretations applied were fully met and lead to conveyance of a
true and fair view of CHEPLAPHARM Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial
performance. There was no deviation from these Standards on account of overriding principles.

**3. Consolidation Methods**

The subject of the consolidated financial statements are CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH and its
subsidiaries. All subsidiaries which are legally controlled by CHEPLAPHARM have been included in the
consolidated financial statements.

Subsidiaries acquired are accounted for according to the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition
corresponds to the fair value of the assets given up, of the equity instruments issued and of the liabilities
incurred or assumed at the time of the transaction. At the time of initial consolidation, assets, liabilities,
and contingent liabilities identifiable as part of a business combination are measured at fair value at the
time of transaction, irrespective of the scope of minority interest.

The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net assets acquired and measured
at fair value is recognized as goodwill.

If the costs of the acquisition are lower than the subsidiary’s net assets acquired and measured at fair value,
the difference is directly recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

The effects of intragroup transactions are eliminated. Assets and liabilities between consolidated entities
are offset against each other. Unrealized profits or losses on intragroup transactions are eliminated.
Intragroup income is eliminated against corresponding expenses. Appropriate taxes on temporary
differences arising on consolidation are deferred in accordance with IAS 12.

**4. Currency Translation of Foreign Subsidiaries Sets of Financial Statements**

Glenwood LLC, Englewood, New Jersey/U.S., is the only consolidated subsidiary that has its registered
office outside the eurozone. The annual financial statements of this Company are translated into euro
according to the functional currency concept. The functional currency of Glenwood LLC is the U.S. dollar
(USD) because all major trade relationships are based on this Company’s local currency.

Assets and liabilities are translated using the rates in effect at the reporting date, the statements of profit
and loss are translated at annual average rates, from the functional into the reporting currency EUR.
Resulting translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The EUR/USD rate at the reporting date is 0.8734 EUR/USD as at 31 December 2018 (prior year:
0.8338 EUR/USD). The average rate for the year 2018 is 0.8476 EUR/USD (prior year: 0.8852 EUR/
USD).

In the statement of movements in fixed assets, the balance at the beginning of the consolidation and at the
end of the financial year is translated using the respective rate in effect at the reporting date and the other
items are translated at average rates. A difference arising from exchange rate changes is disclosed as a
translation difference in a separate column both under cost and under accumulated amortization,
depreciation and impairments.

**5. Entities Included in Consolidation**

All entities which are controlled by CHEPLAPHARM (subsidiaries) are included in the consolidated
financial statements.

CHEPLAPHARM gains control when it has the power over the investee, is exposed to fluctuating returns
from its investment, and has the ability to use its power to influence the rates of return.

CHEPLAPHARM reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if there are facts and circumstances
which indicate that one or several of the three criteria of control referred to above have changed.

An entity is consolidated from the time CHEPLAPHARM is able to control this entity. If this ability
ceases to exist, the entity concerned retires from the group of consolidated entities.

Besides CHEPLAPHARM as the parent company, the group of entities included in the consolidation as at
31 December 2018 comprises 5 (prior year: 7) domestic and 2 (prior year: 2) foreign subsidiaries which are
controlled by CHEPLAPHARM on account of the majority of voting rights.

**for the Financial Year 2018**

**5. Entities Included in Consolidation (Continued)**

These intragroup transactions had no impact on the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial
performance.

**6. Accounting and Measurement Methods**

The sets of individual financial statements of the entities included in the consolidation are prepared
according to uniform accounting and measurement principles. The values recognized in the consolidated
financial statements are solely determined by the economic presentation of the assets, liabilities, financial
position, and financial performance within the scope of the requirements of the IASB.

**Income and Expense Recognition**

The revenue recognized relates to all revenues from product sales and services provided, and to royalty
income. These are based on customer contracts and the performance promised under these contracts
which are individually identified and separately presented for revenue recognition purposes. Other
operative income is disclosed as other operating income.

As in the prior year, revenue is recognized in income when or as soon as the entity transfers to a customer
the power to dispose of goods or services either over a period or at a point in time. This power of
disposition lies with the customer if the customer is able to independently determine the use and the
withdrawal of use related to a product or a service. In the case of product deliveries, revenue is recognized
at the time which, as part of an overall assessment, is orientated towards the existence of a payment claim,
the allocation of title, procurement of ownership, passage of risks and opportunities, as well as customer
acceptance. For delivery transactions, the passage of risks and opportunities, and of the right to determine
the destination of product transport are of special importance. However, revenue from services is
recognized over the period of service provision and depending on stage of performance completion.

In terms of amount, revenue is restricted to the amount which CHEPLAPHARM Group expects to
receive for the performance of obligations. Consideration components to be withheld for third parties have
to be deducted. Therefore, revenue is reduced by value added tax, as well as actual and expected sales
deductions resulting from rebates, cash discounts, and bonuses. Estimates in respect of sales deductions
are primarily based on past experience, specific contract terms, and expectations in respect of the future
revenue trend.

After acquiring drug licenses, CHEPLAPHARM often enters into a so-called ‘‘transition service and
supply agreement’’ (TSA) with the seller, under which the interim period in respect of product distribution
is outlined. The seller sells the drugs in its own name on the account of CHEPLAPHARM until the
necessary marketing authorizations for CHEPLAPHARM are available. CHEPLAPHARM is not
permitted to sell the drugs in its own name until the corresponding conditions under drug law are met.
Until these conditions are met, the inventories continue to be accounted for at the level of the seller
because the seller bears all risks in respect of the inventories. Only after the conditions under drug law
have been met are the inventories billed and transferred to CHEPLAPHARM. In the period between the
acquisition of the drug license and the acquisition of the inventories, CHEPLAPHARM receives from the
seller of the license the gross profit (revenue of the seller less its sales input = net value) from the sale of
the drugs. CHEPLAPHARM makes out corresponding invoices to the seller. These invoices are
recognized as revenue in the amount of the net value (net of cash discounts and rebates).

Operating expenses are expensed at the time the service is received or at the time of its origination.

Interest income and interest expenses are recognized by means of the effective interest method.

Dividends are realized at the time the claim arises.

**6. Accounting and Measurement Methods (Continued)**

**Intangible Assets**

Intangible assets acquired for a consideration are capitalized at cost if it is probable that the use of the
asset is related to a future economic benefit and the costs of the asset can be reliably determined.
Borrowing costs are regularly capitalized only if they relate to the acquisition or production of a qualified
asset.

The assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 2 to 15 years.
Impairment losses are taken into account.

The underlying useful lives correspond to the useful lives expected at group level. The appropriateness of
the useful lives and the carrying amount are reviewed at annual intervals. Necessary changes in estimates
are proactively taken into account.

Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at annual intervals. Reference is made to the
following statements regarding impairment and to Note 16.

An intangible asset is required to be derecognized if no further economic benefit is anticipated from its use
or its disposal any more. The gain on, or loss from, derecognition of an intangible asset is recognized in the
statement of profit and loss at the time the asset is derecognized.

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less wear-related deprecation and impairment losses
which are recognized on a case-by-case basis.

Production costs include all costs allocable to the production process as well as appropriate portions of
production-related overheads. Borrowing costs are capitalized only if they relate to acquisition or
production of a qualified asset.

Elements of property, plant and equipment with a limited useful life are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated economic life unless another depreciation method is appropriate in exceptional
cases on account of the actual pattern of benefits provided.

The underlying useful lives correspond to the useful lives expected at group level. The appropriateness of
the useful lives and the carrying amount are examined at annual intervals. Necessary changes in estimates
are prospectively taken into account.

The assets are depreciated over the following useful lives:

**Designation** **Useful life**
**in years**
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 to 33

Office and operating equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 to 13

**Impairment of Non-current Non-financial Assets**

The recoverability of assets is examined in accordance with IAS 36 if there are events indicating, or indications
of, an impairment. Write-downs are made if the future realizable amount of an asset is lower than its carrying
amount. The amount realizable from an asset corresponds to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and
present value of the future cash flows attributable to the asset (value in use). If it is impossible to allocate to
specific assets own future cash inflows which are generated independently of other assets, their recoverability
has to be tested on the basis of the next higher aggregated cash-generating unit of assets. If the reasons for an
impairment cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are made (except for goodwill).

**6. Accounting and Measurement Methods (Continued)**

**Leases**

In accordance with IAS 17, the beneficial ownership of leased assets is attributed to the lessee if the lessee
essentially bears all risks, and seizes all opportunities arising from the leased asset which are related to
ownership. If beneficial ownership is attributable to CHEPLAPHARM Group, it is capitalized at the lower
of the present value of the lease rentals plus incidental costs possibly to be borne by the lessee and the fair
value of the leased asset at the time when the lessee is entitled to exercise its right to use the leased asset.
The corresponding leasing liability, which is measured according to the effective interest method
subsequent to initial recognition, is recognized at an equivalent amount. The leasing payments are
classified by interest expenses and repayment of the leasing obligation in such a way that constant payment
of interest on the remaining liability is achieved. Interest expenses are expensed as incurred.

The amortization methods and useful lives of capitalized leasing assets correspond to those of comparable
assets acquired.

Rental income and rental expenses under operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the corresponding agreements.

**Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018**

Financial instruments are contracts which lead to a financial asset at the level of an entity and to a financial
liability at the level of another entity. At the time of initial recognition, financial assets and financial
liabilities are measured at fair value.

At CHEPLAPHARM Group level, financial assets are allocated to the categories ‘‘measured at amortized
cost (AC)’’, and ‘‘measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)’’. Financial assets with residual
terms of more than twelve months are classified as non-current.

The category ‘‘measured at amortized cost (AC)’’ comprises financial assets whose cash flows consist in
interest payments and repayments and which are held according to a business model which provides for
holding of the instrument in order to realize contractual cash flows. After initial recognition, they are
measured at amortized cost less impairments, if any, according to the effective interest method.

The category ‘‘measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)’’ comprises financial assets which
cannot be classified otherwise. They are measured at fair value. The resulting changes in value are
recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

The existence of an impairment of a financial asset is determined on the basis of expected credit losses
(expected loss model) as at every balance sheet date.

For this purpose, the simplified impairment model is applied for trade receivables, and impairments are
always measured in the amount of the credit losses expected over the term. The credit losses are
determined on the basis of an item-by-item analysis of trade receivables, taking into account delinquencies.
For financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, no impairment loss is recognized on the basis of
expected credit losses on account of the very short terms (partially due at demand) and the credit standing
of our contract partners. For all other financial assets within the scope of application of the impairment
model under IFRS 9, risk provision is made on the basis of credit losses (expected loss model) expected to
be incurred over the next twelve months.

An impairment loss of a financial asset is recognized as incurred. For financial assets of the category AC,
the impairment reduces the amount recognized for the asset on the balance sheet. A financial asset
continues to be directly amortized if, based on an appropriate estimate, it is not assumed to be fully or
partially realizable.

Subsequent to initial recognition, **financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost (AC) according to**
the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized through profit or loss as part of the

**6. Accounting and Measurement Methods (Continued)**

amortization by means of the effective interest method, as well as at the time the liabilities are
derecognized. Liabilities with residual terms of more than twelve months are classified as non-current.

**Financial assets and financial liabilities are derecognized if the power of disposition over the contractual**
rights has been lost or the underlying obligation has been met, terminated, or expired.

**Financial Instruments until 31 December 2017**

**Non-current non-derivative financial assets are capitalized at fair value, which corresponds to cost, at the**
date of settlement, i.e. at the time assets originate or are transferred.

For the purposes of measurement as at the reporting date subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets
are classified by loans and receivables extended by the Company, by financial assets held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose which the respective
instrument was acquired for.

Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables extended and held-to-maturity financial
instruments are measured at amortized cost as at every reporting date. However, available-for-sale assets
are recognized at fair value as at the reporting dates subsequent to initial recognition, with changes in the
value of instruments held for trading being charged or credited in the statement of profit and loss.

Available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at fair value as at the reporting date if this value can be
reliably determined. Fluctuations in the value between the reporting dates are allocated to reserves
without profit or loss impact. The reserves are released through the statement of profit and loss either at
the time of disposal or if the fair value sustainably decreases below the carrying amount.

Allowances with profit or loss impact are made on extended loans and receivables to the extent that the
amount realizable as at the reporting date decreases below the carrying amount.

A financial asset (or a part of a financial asset or a part of a group of similar financial assets) is
derecognized (i.e. removed from the consolidated balance sheet) if one of the following requirements is
met:

- The contractual rights in respect of cash flows from a financial asset have expired, or

- the Group has transferred its contractual rights in respect of cash flows from a financial asset to third
parties.

**Current non-derivative financial assets classified as current assets comprise receivables, securities as well as**
cash at bank and cash-in-hand.

All current financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, which, for non-derivative financial
instruments, corresponds to acquisition cost, at the date of settlement, i.e. at the time the account
receivable originates or beneficial ownership is transferred. The acquisition cost of monetary receivables
bearing minor or no interest corresponds to their present value at the time of origination.

Subsequent to initial recognition, current financial assets are measured depending on the categorization
analogous to non-current financial assets.

**—Receivables**

Receivables are initially recognized at fair value and according to the amortized cost method subsequent to
initial recognition, using the effective interest method and taking into account any impairment losses.

If there are doubts as to the recoverability of receivables, these are recognized at the lower realizable
amount by making a corresponding specific allowance.

Receivables denominated in foreign currency are measured at the middle rate at the reporting date.

**6. Accounting and Measurement Methods (Continued)**

**—Securities**

Securities are recognized at market value.

**—Cash at Bank and Cash-in-hand**

Cash has been recognized at nominal amount. Foreign currency balances have been measured at the
middle rate at the reporting date.

**Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequent to**
initial recognition, these are accounted for at amortized cost. For non-current credits, any difference
between the amount paid out (after deducting transaction cost) and the amount to be repaid is recognized
through profit or loss according to the effective interest rate method over the term of the credit.

Non-derivative financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency are measured at the middle rate at the
reporting date. Changes in value on account of currency effects are recognized through profit or loss.

**Derivative Financial Instruments**

CHEPLAPHARM regularly uses derivative financial instruments for hedging against interest rate risks.

In accordance with the rules under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments are regularly recognized at fair
value (without taking into account incidental costs) in the balance sheet and accounted for at fair value
accordingly subsequent to initial recognition.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are directly recognized in the net profit or loss
for the period. Positive and negative fair values are disclosed on the asset and on the liability sides,
respectively, taking into account deferred taxes. There is no hedging.

**Inventories**

The item inventories comprises raw materials, consumables and supplies, work in progress and finished
goods and merchandise as well as prepayments.

Inventories are recognized at cost. As at the reporting date, they are measured at the lower of cost and net
realizable value.

The net realizable value corresponds to the sales revenue realizable in course of the ordinary business less
directly allocable costs to sell.

Besides directly allocable costs, cost also includes appropriate portions of indirect material and production
overheads at normal utilization of the production facilities concerned to the extent that these are incurred
in connection with the production process. Costs of company pension plans, for social facilities of the
business and voluntary social benefits of the Company as well as general and administrative expenses are
also taken into account to the extent that these relate to the area of production. Finance costs are not
included in cost.

**Current Non-financial Assets**

Current non-financial assets primarily relate to tax assets as well as to other non-contractual claims and
prepaid expenses.

Current non-financial assets are recognized at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at
amortized cost, taking into account appropriate allowances.

**6. Accounting and Measurement Methods (Continued)**

**Other Non-financial Liabilities**

Other non-financial liabilities which are not based on contractual commitments and the direct or indirect
subject of which is the exchange of cash are disclosed under the item other liabilities unless these are tax
liabilities.

Non-financial liabilities are initially recognized at the amount which corresponds to the anticipated outflow
of resources. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in value which result from new findings are
charged or credited in the statement of profit and loss. The amount required to be recognized is the
amount of the best possible estimate which is necessary for settling the liability as at the reporting date.

Liabilities denominated in foreign currency are measured at the middle rate at the reporting date.

**Income Taxes**

In accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the individual
Companies’ tax balance sheet values and the values recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
Tax loss carryforwards which are likely to be realizable in the future are capitalized in the amount of the
deferred tax asset.

Asset-side deferred taxes are eliminated against liability-side deferred taxes if they belong to the same
taxable entity and this taxable entity is entitled to offset current tax assets against tax liabilities and they
relate to income taxes which are levied by the same fiscal authority.

The deferred tax rates ranged from 14.5% to 16.4% (prior year: from 13.3% to 16.4%) for German
municipal trade tax and were at 15.8% (prior year: 15.8%) for German corporate income tax and the
solidarity surcharge. There are no deferred taxes at the level of the two foreign subsidiaries.

Current income taxes have been disclosed as income tax liabilities to the extent that they have not yet been
paid over. If the income tax amounts already paid exceed the amounts owed, the differences have been
recognized as income tax assets.

**Material Judgments and Estimates**

In applying the accounting and valuation methods, management made the following judgments and
estimates which impact on the amount and the disclosure of recognized assets and liabilities, of income
and expenses, and of contingent liabilities:

**—Measurement of Intangible Assets (See Note 16)**

In acquiring drug licenses, CHEPLAPHARM determines the useful life of these intangible assets
according to criteria such as market share, possible market entry of potential competitors, legal and
country risks, as well as revenue and sales budgeted for the respective medicine. Judgments are generally
made in determining the useful life.

**—Goodwill (See Note 16)**

The impairment test of goodwill is based on forward-looking assumptions. These tests are performed by
CHEPLAPHARM annually and additionally on occasions which indicate that goodwill might have been
impaired. The determination of the value in use of the cash-generating unit includes definitions and
estimates in respect of the forecast and discounting of future cash flows. Although management anticipates
that the assumptions underlying the calculation of the realizable amount are appropriate, potential
unforeseeable changes in these assumptions, for instance a reduction in EBITDA margins, a rise in cost of
capital or a decrease in the long-term growth rate, lead to an impairment loss which could sustainably
influence the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance.

Estimates are based on empirical data and other assumptions which are deemed to be appropriate under
the given circumstances. They are continuously verified, but may deviate from actual values.

**6. Accounting and Measurement Methods (Continued)**

Further explanations concerning assumptions and estimates made are provided in the statements regarding
the individual items of the financial statements. All assumptions and estimates are based on circumstances
and assessments at the reporting date. Furthermore, in assessing the future business development, the
economic environment in the industries and regions CHEPLAPHARM Group operates in which was
supposed to be realistic at this time has been taken into account. At the time the consolidated financial
statements were prepared, the underlying assumptions and estimates were not expected to change
significantly.

merged into Sanavita Pharmaceuticals GmbH.

The goodwill of kEUR 875 arising on acquisition of the two companies RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH
and RubiePharm Vertriebs GmbH was allocated to the contract manufacturing cash-generating unit, which
is identical to the Company RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH.

The goodwill of kEUR 1,793 arising on acquisition of Helm Medical GmbH was allocated to the medical
product cash-generating unit, which, after the merger of Helm Medical GmbH into Sanavita GmbH, is
identical to the Company Sanavita GmbH.

In the reporting year, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. This impairment test
was based on the present value of the future net cash inflows because there is no market price.

The values in use determined for the cash-generating units which include the goodwill significantly
exceeded the respective carrying amounts of the cash-generating units. An increase in the discount factor
by 1.0 percentage points would also not lead to an impairment requirement as at 31 December 2018.

The values in use were determined by means of budget figures for a 4-year period, using a pretax discount
rate of 12.73% or 12.93% (prior year: 11.39%) and a growth factor after the detailed planning period of
1.00% (prior year: 1.00%) p.a. The discount factors were determined by means of market data. Weighted
capital costs (WACC, weighted average cost of capital) are calculated according to the capital asset pricing
model (CAPM). The growth factor corresponds to the expected long-term average inflation rate.

With the exception of goodwill, intangible assets generally have a limited useful life and are therefore
amortized over the useful life.

value.

**19. Leased Assets**

The rental agreements and leases existing at the level of CHEPLAPHARM Group relate to business
premises, the vehicle fleet and other assets (mainly SAP software and machinery). The corresponding
leases are classified as operating leases because basically all risks and opportunities related to ownership
remain with the lessor. There are no purchase options at the end of the lease terms, except for the leases
concerning machinery. The rental agreements do not provide for price adjustment clauses or extension
options.

The leasing payments are expensed on a straight-line basis in the statement of profit and loss over the
periods.

The future rental and leasing payments for the next few years can be analyzed as follows:

The derivative financial instruments disclosed under other non-current assets, under other non-current
financial liabilities, and under other current financial liabilities total kEUR 40 (prior year: kEUR 68),
kEUR 5,654 (prior year: kEUR 290), and kEUR 3,538 (prior year: kEUR 0), respectively. See also
note 33.

The derivative financial instruments solely relate to interest- and currency-related transactions as well as to
OTC products, i.e. products which are not traded on a stock exchange.

Derivative financial instruments have been measured at the fair market value determined. This value is
based on internal risk models which are determined according to recognized mathematical methods. The
method applied for this purpose is the discounted cash flow method, where future cash flows are estimated
on the basis of forward exchange rates (rates observable at the reporting date) and contracted forward
exchange rates and discounted using an interest rate which takes into account the various counterparties’
credit risk.

The carrying amounts of the derivatives correspond to fair market values.

**23. Trade Receivables**

Trade receivables can be analyzed as follows:

**31 Dec. 2018** **31 Dec. 2017**
**kEUR** **kEUR**
Gross receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 116,171 53,657

**113,950** **52,339**

The Company continuously assesses the credit standing of its customers and normally requests no
collaterals. The Company made allowances for potential losses of receivables outstanding. Such losses of
receivables corresponded to management’s estimates and assumptions and are within the normal scope of
the business.

The major terms of payment range between cash in advance and a time of 180 days, net, allowed for
payment.

The following table shows the changes in allowances on trade receivables:

**2018** **2017**
**kEUR** **kEUR**

**Allowances made on 31 Dec. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **2,221** **1,318**

Allowances on trade receivables are normally recognized in allowance accounts. The decision as to
whether a default risk is initially taken into account by means of an allowance account or directly taken
into account by reducing the account receivable depends on the degree of probability of a loss of an
account receivable outstanding. If receivables are classified as irrecoverable, the corresponding impaired
asset is derecognized.

The following tables show the credit risk included in trade receivables:

**Credit risk as at 31 December 2018:**

**Of which: overdue as at reporting date for the**
**following periods**
**Of which: not** **Between Between** **Between**
**Gross** **overdue as at** **Less than** **31 and** **61 and** **91 and** **More than**
**kEUR** **receivables reporting date** **30 days** **60 days** **90 days** **120 days** **120 days**

Trade receivables as at 31 Dec. 2018 . 116,171 96,261 9,302 4,326 2,786 283 3,213
Expected credit loss ratio . . . . . . . . . 8.54% 50.18% 57.30%
Expected credit loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . 238 142 1,841

CHEPLAPHARM makes allowances on trade receivables which are overdue for more than 60 days.
Allowances of 25%, 50% and 75% are made on all receivables that are overdue between 61 and 90 days,
between 91 and 120 days, and more than 120 days, respectively. Since qualitative criteria are additionally
applied, the actual allowance rate can deviate from said percentages.

The receivables not overdue as at the reporting date include receivables of kEUR 11,935 whose due date
depends on clearance sales of the inventories delivered to customers to their end customers. These
receivables have separately been measured as part of a qualitative analysis.

**32. Mezzanine Loan Notes**

On 5 April 2016, a financing package was signed for financing the acquisition of the drugs Xenical and
Dilatrend. The three financing modules contain a mezzanine loan note of mEUR 65 with a term of 6 years,
note loans **(‘‘senior loans’’) in several tranches with terms of 3.5 and 5.5 years and a total volume of**
mEUR 95 and a new tranche within the syndicated bank financing of mEUR 160 plus mEUR 10 shortterm operating financing.

On 15 September 2016, a junior note loan agreement (mezzanine loan note) was concluded with Rantum
Capital GmbH & Co. Private Debt Fund I KG, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, and Proventus Capital
Partners III KB, Stockholm/Sweden, on a fixed-interest loan of up to mEUR 65. The capital existing as at
31 December 2017 amounted to kEUR 63,426. This capital was redeemed early as part of the refinancing
in the reporting year. As part of this early redemption, a prepayment compensation totaling kEUR 20,000,
which is disclosed under finance result, was paid.

CHEPLAPHARM’s bank financing mainly comprises two different instruments.

Until and including 2014, CHEPLAPHARM’s corporate financing via bilateral amortizing loans with
various banks had been project-related. The residual financial liabilities as at the reporting date
31 December 2017 total kEUR 674. The collaterals furnished for the remaining financial liabilities from
bilateral amortizing loans were pledged trademarks and licenses of the drugs Vesanoid and Rohypnol
acquired through the transaction (carrying amount as at 31 Dec. 2017: kEUR 34,054), Mr Sebastian
Braun’s subordination, a profit retention and equity maintenance agreement including Mr Sebastian
Braun’s collateral purpose agreement, and Mr Norbert Braun’s loan maintenance and subordination
agreement.

On 28 January 2015, a new, also project-related instrument in the form of the syndicated loan agreement
was established within the bank financing. On 30 June 2017, the syndicated loan dated 28 January 2015 was
increased by mEUR 47.5 to a total principal of mEUR 329.44 under the 4[th] supplement. As at 4 January
2018, there was another increase of mEUR 69.0. All eight tranches have a respective term of 20 quarters
and a corresponding straight-line repayment profile. The new tranche A8 had a term until 30 September
2022 and was paid out on 15 February 2018. This tranche accrues interest at a variable rate. In addition,
the syndicated loan agreement provides for a working capital line of credit of up to mEUR 5 in the form of
an overdraft facility.

On 28 November 2017, bilateral interim financing totaling mEUR 100 was agreed with Deutsche Bank.
The purpose of this interim financing was to partly repay the syndicated financing and to acquire further
licenses in January 2018. The interim financing included an amount of mEUR 50 which was issued in the
form of notes. The amount was paid out in two partial amounts. The first partial amount of mEUR 50 was
paid out on 29 December 2017. The second partial amount was paid out on 3 January 2018. The term was
9 months plus a 3-month extension option. The interest rate was 1-month EURIBOR plus 2.25% p.a.

**for the Financial Year 2018**

**33. Other Financial Liabilities (Continued)**

The syndicated loan agreement provided for compliance with financial covenants and, in the event of noncompliance with these financial covenants, the lenders were granted an extraordinary right to give notice of
termination. Compliance with the financial covenants was continuously monitored and controlled by
management within the framework of the budget planning and by means of actual data and was regularly
reported to the lending banks. In the financial year 2018 and in the prior year, the Company fully complied
with the relevant financial covenants. Until the refinancing on 12 July 2019, the Company was in
compliance with the covenants.

The financial liabilities within the syndicated loan have been collateralized through a loan maintenance
and subordination agreement including collateral purpose agreement of Mr Sebastian Braun, of
Mr Norbert Braun, of Braun Beteiligungs GmbH, and of Braun Hanse Holding GmbH, as well as through
a profit retention and equity maintenance agreement.

As at 12 July 2018, the existing financing was restructured. The debts under the syndicated loan agreement,
senior and junior note loans were redeemed and replaced by a senior facility in the form of a term loan B
totaling mEUR 530, and a junior facility in the form of a revolving facility totaling mEUR 250. The junior
facility was increased by another mEUR 60 to mEUR 310 as at 26 July 2018. The senior facility was
increased by another mEUR 300 on 30 November 2018.

Both the term loan B and the revolving facility are maturity loans. The term of term loan B is 7 years until
30 June 2025. The revolving facility has a term of 6 years until 30 June 2024.

For term loan B, the shares in CHEPLAPHARM were furnished as a collateral.

The interest rate for term loan B1 is 1-month EURIBOR plus 4.5%. For term loan B2, this rate could be
reduced to 1-month EURIBOR plus 4.0%. The interest rate of the revolving facility is 1-month
EURIBOR plus 3.25%.

The senior facility agreement provides for a right to give notice of termination for extraordinary reasons,
should financial covenants fail to be complied with. On the one hand, there is a covenant in the form of a
net senior leverage, which should not exceed 5.75. On the other hand, the total net leverage is restricted
and must not exceed 4.75 for new acquisitions.

To hedge against the interest rate risk, CHEPLAPHARM Group performed interest rate cap and interest
rate swap transactions with selected syndicated banks for a nominal amount of mEUR 557.8 as at
31 December 2018 (mEUR 176.9 as at 31 December 2017) with different terms. For details, reference is
made to note 20.

**34. Liabilities to Affiliated Companies**

These liabilities relate to a loan granted by Braun Beteiligungs GmbH, which is repayable at bullet
maturity in 2026. There are subordination and maintenance agreements for this loan.

**35. Deferred Tax Liabilities**

For an analysis of deferred tax liabilities see note 15.

**36. Other Non-current Financial Liabilities**

Non-current other liabilities solely include non-current derivative financial instruments (see note 20).

**Determination of Fair Value**

The carrying amount of non-current financial instruments corresponds to fair value.

The carrying amount of financial instruments of measurement category ‘‘AC’’, such as assets and liabilities,
corresponds to fair value on account of the current maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying
amount of financial liabilities largely corresponds to fair value because these predominantly bear interest
at variable rates.

The Company monitors the variations in fixed- and variable-interest liabilities as well as in non-current and
current liabilities. Related business and other finance risks are verified.

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing fair values of financial instruments
for each measurement procedure:

Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities,

Level 2: Procedures where all input parameters which have a material influence on the fair value
recognized are either directly or indirectly observable,

Level 3: Procedures using input parameters which have a material influence on the fair value recognized
and are not based on an observable market data.

As in the prior year, derivatives as at 31 December 2018 (see note 20) and securities (see note 26) were
measured at fair value at the level of CHEPLAPHARM Group. The fair values of derivatives are derived
from observable market data and are thus attributable to hierarchy level 2. Securities are measured at
market price and are thus attributable to hierarchy level 1.

Both in the reporting year and in the prior year, no instruments were reclassified between these three
levels.

The net gains of the category under IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Assets at Amortized Cost’’ (prior year: category
under IAS 39 ‘‘Loans and Receivables’’) include allowances made on receivables and losses of outstanding
receivables, as well as interest income. In CHEPLAPHARM’s consolidated financial statements, income
from allowances attributable to the category under IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Assets at Amortized Cost’’ (prior
year: category under IAS 39 ‘‘Loans and Receivables’’) is disclosed under other operating income and
expenses related to allowances made on receivables and losses of receivables outstanding are disclosed
under other operating expenses.

The net gains attributable to the category under IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or
Loss’’ (prior year: category under IAS 39 ‘‘Available for Sale’’) include income from securities, and gains
on disposal of investments which are disclosed under net income from investments.

**42. Supplementary Notes to Financial Instruments (Continued)**

The net losses attributable to the category under IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Liabilities at Amortized Cost’’ (prior
year: category under IAS 39 ‘‘Financial Liabilities at Cost’’) primarily result from interest paid on financial
liabilities.

The net losses attributable to the category under IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit
or Loss’’ (prior year: category under IAS 39 ‘‘Financial Assets and Liabilities Held for Trading’’) result
from derivative financial instruments accounted for and relate to fair value changes.

Interest from financial instruments is disclosed under interest result (see note 14).

**43. Financial Risk Management and Financial Derivatives**

**General Notes to Risk Management**

CHEPLAPHARM combines the measures for managing risks which exist at corporate level in a risk
management system. The basic instruments of CHEPLAPHARM’s risk management are regular
reporting, forecast, planning and strategy processes. The system provides for regular identification and
assessment of new and known risks through responsible staff. In addition, the corporate functions of
CHEPLAPHARM Group report on financial and operative developments on a monthly basis. Through
these measures, management is informed at regular intervals and at an early stage about the risk position
and can take appropriate measures for risk mitigation and avoidance or prevention.

In respect of its assets, liabilities, planned transactions and existing obligations, CHEPLAPHARM is
especially exposed to credit risks, default risks, cash risks, as well risks from changing interest rates. The
goal of financial risk management is to mitigate these market risks through current operative and financeorientated activities. According to management’s assessment, there is no risk concentration. By means of
the measures referred to above, it is regularly examined whether risk clusters develop.

Fundamental finance policies are determined by management at annual intervals. Management is
responsible for implementing, and controlling during the year, the financial policies as well as current risk
management.

**Credit Risk**

The liquid funds mainly contain cash and cash equivalents. In connection with the investment of liquid
funds, the Group is exposed to losses resulting from credit risks if financial institutions fail to meet their
obligations.

The risk of loss of liquid funds is deemed to be low because the banks the Group works with have excellent
credit ratings.

**Default Risk**

The default risk is the risk of a loss for the Group if a contracting party fails to meet its contractual
obligations. Default risks primarily relate to trade receivables which arise from ordinary business activities
and predominantly relate to solvent small to medium-sized entities.

The Group only enters into business relationships with creditworthy contract partners and, if necessary,
only if collaterals are furnished or prepayments are made in order to mitigate the risks of a loss from
counterparty failure.

Before a business relationship is established, the respective credit quality of the potential customer is
assessed.

Uncollected receivables are nevertheless continuously monitored; furthermore, the Group has established
an active dunning system. Default risks are covered by making allowances. As part of a regular analysis of
receivables portfolios, no significant change in the default risk was established in 2019.

**43. Financial Risk Management and Financial Derivatives (Continued)**

There are no major default risks of specific contracting parties or of a group of contracting parties with
similar features.

The maximum default risk is reflected by the carrying amounts of the financial assets recognized in the
balance sheet.

**Liquidity Risk**

The liquidity risk of CHEPLAPHARM Group consists in the fact that the Company is possibly unable to
meet its financial obligations, for instance repayment of financial liabilities, payment of purchase
commitments, and obligations under leases. To avoid a realization of this risk and to ensure that the Group
is at any time able to pay and flexible in financial terms, a cash reserve in the form of cash and credit lines
is provided. In addition, the Group’s liquidity is continuously monitored by means of liquidity forecasts. As
at 31 December 2018, the undrawn current credit lines available to the Group amounted to kEUR 310,000
(prior year: kEUR 6,225). These credit lines include a revolving credit facility within the meaning of an
investment facility and an overdraft facility totaling kEUR 294,500 and kEUR 15,500, respectively.

The (non-discounted) repayments and interest payments expected to result from financial liabilities during
the next few years are as follows:

reporting date.

Payments of derivative financial liabilities with a carrying amount of kEUR 9,192 is considered within the
payments of the financial liabilities.

**Financial Market Risks**

CHEPLAPHARM is generally exposed to market price risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and
interest rates. These may result in negative effects on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position, and
financial performance.

The major transactions of CHEPLAPHARM Group are performed in the eurozone. For the Company in
the U.S., the functional currency is the USD. Consequently, there are currency risks between the USD and
the EUR. Since the Companies in the U.S. predominantly perform their activities in their functional
currency, the exchange risk of the Group from its normal operating activities and from translation of
foreign sets of financial statements is deemed to be low.

**43. Financial Risk Management and Financial Derivatives (Continued)**

Besides, there are transactions in foreign currencies which manly result from the Group’s operating
activities, namely from transactions in CHF, USD, and GBP. Management regularly monitors the potential
currency risks and, if necessary, takes active hedging measures in order to minimize risks. The resulting
residual currency risk is generally deemed by management to be insignificant on account of the low
volumes of the corresponding assets and liabilities.

The interest rate risk of the Group primarily results from financial liabilities which accrue variable interest
on the basis of the EURIBOR. The Group is exposed to these interest rate risks in the eurozone.

Had the market interest rate level as at 31 December 2018 been 50 base points higher, earnings would have
been kEUR 659 (31 December 2017: kEUR 1,179) lower. This hypothetical effect on earnings is due to the
potential effects of variable-interest liabilities and from derivative financial instruments measured at fair
value. Since no financial instruments are measured without profit and loss impact, there are no direct
effects on consolidated equity beyond this earnings effect. The decrease in the amount in comparison with
the prior year is due to the restructured financing.

As at 31 December 2018 (as well as in 2017), there was, in the Company’s opinion, no significant other
price risk.

**44. Capital Management**

The main objective of CHEPLAPHARM Group’s capital management is to secure the ability to repay
debts and to pay interest and to maintain financial resources in the future.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments, taking into account overall economic
conditions. As at 31 December 2018, the goals, guidelines, and procedures remained unchanged. The goal
is to appropriately adapt the capital structure to the business risk.

CHEPLAPHARM is subject to statutory capital requirements for limited liability companies. Compliance
with these requirements is continuously monitored. In the reporting period, these requirements were met.

The capital managed by the Group is the economic equity and this capital is monitored by means of the
debt-equity ratio, which corresponds to the ratio of net debt to economic equity, as well as of the total
amount of net debt and equity ratio. Net debt comprises current and non-current financial liabilities less
liquid funds. In addition to equity, the economic equity includes the liabilities to affiliated companies (in
prior year: loans granted by related parties, and the mezzanine capital), which are disclosed under noncurrent liabilities.

financial commitments of kEUR 223,502 as at 31 December 2018 (prior year: kEUR 194,597) which relate

The following independent auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with
Section 322 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) in German language on the German version
of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (Konzernlagebericht) of
Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH as of and for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. The group
management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald/Germany

**Audit Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH,
Greifswald/Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at
31 December 2018, and the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of
cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2018, and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited
the group management report of CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald/Germany, for the
financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2018.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code
(HGB) and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2018, and of its financial performance for the
financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2018, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) Sentence 1 German Commercial Code (HGB), we declare that our audit has
not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report.

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with Section 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) and in compliance with German
Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further
described in the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of
the Group Management Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities
in accordance with German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated
financial statements and on the group management report.

**Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group**
**Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of
German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and that the
consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the
assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

F-65


-----

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group**
**Management Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with Section 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) and in compliance with German
Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and
this group management report.

We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also

- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the group management report
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going
concern.

- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying

F-66


-----

transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB).

- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

- evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements,
its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the
group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**1. General notes (Continued)**

The financial year of CHEPLAPHARM and its subsidiaries is the calendar year. The consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in euro. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are stated in
thousands of euros (kEUR). For computational reasons, rounding differences to the exact mathematical
values may rise in tables and notes.

The balance sheet has been classified according to maturity; assets and liabilities are classified by
non-current—for maturities of more than one year—and current. The nature of expense format has been
applied to the income statement.

The consolidated financial statements of CHEPLAPHARM were approved by the managing directors on
17 December 2018.

**2. Policies and methods**

All IFRSs issued by the IASB and valid at the time the consolidated financial statements on hand were
prepared and applied by CHEPLAPHARM were adopted by the European Commission for application in
the EU. The consolidated financial statements prepared by CHEPLAPHARM thus comply with the IFRS,
as adopted by the EU.

The accounting and valuation methods which we applied are generally consistent with those applied in the
prior year, with the following exceptions:

In the reporting year, CHEPLAPHARM applied the new and revised IFRSs and Interpretations listed
below. The application of these Standards and Interpretations did not have any impact on the Group’s net
assets, financial position and results from operations. However, they partly led to additional disclosures.

The detailed presentation is restricted to those Standards and Interpretations which are on principle
applicable at the level of CHEPLAPHARM:

**Revision of IAS 7—Reconciliation of Liabilities Resulting from Financing Activities**

In January 2016, the IASB published the revision of IAS 7 as part of the disclosure initiative of the IASB.

According to this revised Standard, entities are required to make disclosures which enable users of the
financial statements to understand both changes of a cash nature and non-cash changes in liabilities which
result from financing activities. The changes take effect for reporting years which begin on or after
1 January 2017. Entities applying the revised Standard for the first time are not required to state any
comparative information for prior reporting periods. In a reconciliation, the Group presents the variations
between the opening and closing balances of the financial liabilities concerned. (See Note 45.)

**Revision of IAS 12—Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses**

On 19 January 2016, the IASB published the revision of IAS 12. This revision mainly makes it clear that,
for assets accounted for at fair value (e.g. fixed-interest debt instruments) whose fiscal values are
acquisition costs, unrealized losses lead to deductible temporary differences, irrespective of the future use
of the assets. Furthermore, tax deductions related to release of other deductible temporary differences are
required to be taken into account in recognizing resulting deferred tax assets when estimating future
taxable income. The changes are applicable for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The
revisions do not have any major effects on the Group.

**IFRS improvements (2014-2016): Revision of IFRS 12**

The IFRS improvements (2014-2016) constitute a joint Standard, which was published in December 2016
and addresses changes to various IFRSs. This Standard revises three IFRSs, of which only the revisions to
IFRS 12 are mandatorily applicable for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017. IFRS 12
clarifies that the disclosure under IFRS 12 are regularly also applicable to such shares in subsidiaries, joint
ventures or associated companies that are classified as held for sale within the meaning of IFRS 5; an

exemption are the disclosures under IFRS 12.B10-B16 (Financial Information). This revision does not
have any major effects on the consolidated financial statements.

The IASB published the Standards and Interpretations listed below, which have already been implemented
into EU law, but had not yet been mandatorily applicable in the financial year 2017. CHEPLAPHARM
does not adopt these Standards and Interpretations early. The detailed presentation is restricted to those
Standards and Interpretations which might principally be relevant at CHEPLAPHARM Group level in the
future.

**IFRS 9—Financial Instruments**

On 24 July 2014, the IASB published the final Standard IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9 (2014)),
which includes the results of all stages of the IFRS 9 project and supersedes both IAS 39 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all earlier versions of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. This
Standard includes new regulations on classification and measurement, on impairment and on hedge
accounting. IFRS 9 is applicable from the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early
adoption of the final Standard (IFRS 9 (2014)) is admissible at any time. With the exception of hedge
accounting, this Standard is retroactively applicable, but comparative information is not required to be
adjusted. The requirements on hedge accounting are generally prospectively applicable with few
exceptions.

The Group intends to adopt this new Standard as of the effective date. The requirements on classification
and measurement are not expected to have any major effects on the classification and measurement of the
Group’s financial assets. Loans and trade receivables are held in order to realize the contractual cash flows
which solely constitute repayment and interest payments on the outstanding nominal amount. Therefore,
the Group anticipates that these will continue to also be measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9.
However, the Group will examine in an even more detailed manner the features of the contractually
agreed cash flows of these instruments before it is possible to finally assess whether all these financial
instruments meet the criteria of measurement at amortized cost under IFRS 9.

Under IFRS 9, the Group is required to measure expected credit losses (ECL) from its notes, credits and
trade receivables either on the basis of the 12-month ECL or on the basis of the total term to maturity of
the ECL. The Group intends to apply the simplified approach and to recognize the total term to maturity
of the ECL from all trade receivables. According to the information previously available, the changed
impairment rules will have no major effects on the Group’s net assets, financial position and results from
operations.

Since the Group does presently not account for hedging relationships, the adoption of IFRS 9 is not
expected to have any effects.

**IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

IFRS 15 was published on 28 May 2014 and introduces a new model of revenue recognition with five
analysis steps, which is applicable to any revenue under contracts with customers. The core principle of this
Standard is that an entity is required to recognize revenue, when the time goods or services are transferred
to customers, in the amount of the consideration which the entity can reasonably expect to receive for the
transfer of these goods or services. The principles under IFRS 15 provide a structured approach for
measuring and recognizing revenue. The scope of application of this Standard covers all types of industries
and entities and therefore supersedes all existing regulations which relate to the area of revenue
recognition (IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs,
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers,
and SIC 31 Revenue—Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services). Compared to the revenue
recognition standards presently applicable, the adoption of this new Standard requires more estimates and
judgments because the amount of revenue to be recognized is determined by the amount of the
consideration which the entity can reasonably expect to receive for the transfer of the goods or services.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**2. Policies and methods (Continued)**

Specific challenges may especially arise where a consideration is variable. IFRS 15 is applicable from the
financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It is required either to be fully applied retrospectively
or to be retrospectively applied in a modified version. Early adoption is admissible.

The Group intends to apply this new Standard as of its official effective date, using the modified
retroactive approach. In 2017, the Group examined the potential effects of conversion to IFRS 15 and
concluded that the new Standard does not lead to a major change in revenue recognition.

The business activities of CHEPLAPHARM Group mainly consist in distribution of branded
pharmaceuticals, food supplements, medical products and cosmetics. Revenue recognition for contracts
with customers under which the sale of goods constitutes the sole performance obligation is not expected
to change on account of the new Standard. The Group anticipates that revenue is recognized at the time
when the power to control assets passes to customers. This is generally the case at the time when goods are
delivered. In respect of the accounting for returns and warranties, we do not expect any changes on
account of the adoption of IFRS 15.

The contracts on sale of pharmaceuticals often provide for rebates. Presently, the Group recognizes
revenue from sale of pharmaceuticals at the fair value of the remuneration received or of the account
receivable less returns, price rebates and discounts. If revenue cannot be reliably measured, it is cut off as
long as the uncertainty ceases to exist. Under IFRS 15, such contractual arrangements lead to the fact that
the remuneration is variable and has to be estimated at the time the contract is concluded. To avoid
overstatement of revenues realized, IFRS 15 requires that the variable remuneration has to be limited. In
analyzing the effects of IFRS 15, the Group concluded that there will be no material changes in revenue
recognition on account of the variable purchase price elements because rebates can normally directly be
allocated to specific revenue and be reliably estimated.

**Clarifications concerning IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

On 12 April 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published the final clarifications
concerning its new Standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The related changes clarify implementation issues. These issues relate to the identification of performance
obligations, the application guidelines for principal/agent relationships and licenses for intellectual
property (IP) as well as transitional provisions. In addition, the purpose of the changes is to ensure a more
uniform procedure in implementing IFRS 15 and to reduce the costs and complexity associated with its
application. The changes took effect on 1 January 2018. Entities are required to apply these changes
retroactively. For details on the effects on the Group, see the statements regarding IFRS 15.

**IFRS 16—Leases**

On 13 January 2016, the IASB published the new Standard on recognition of leases, which supersedes the
previous Standard IAS 17. IFRS 16 defines the principles for recognizing, measuring, presenting and
disclosing leases and requires lessees to recognize all leases according to a single model similar to
accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. For lessees, this Standard provides that the right to use the
leased asset and a corresponding leasing liability mandatorily have to be recognized for most leases.
However, for lessors there are only minor changes in comparison with the classification of, and accounting
for, leases under IAS 17. Under IFRS 16, both lessees and lessors are required to provide expanded
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. IFRS 16 is applicable from financial years beginning on
or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is admissible, is, however, only permitted if the entity also applies
IFRS 15. Lessees applying this new Standard for the first time are permitted to either choose full
retrospective recognition or modified retrospective recognition. The transitional provisions under IFRS 16
concede certain transitional reduced disclosure requirements.

The Group intends to adopt this new Standard as of its official effective date. For the material leases under
IFRS 16 which have previously not already been treated as finance leases, see the statements in Note 19
regarding payment obligations for operating leases.

**2. Policies and methods (Continued)**

**IFRIC 22—Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration**

On 8 December 2016, the IASB published IFRIC 22. This Interpretation covers transactions in foreign
currency if an entity recognizes a non-monetary asset or a non-monetary liability which arises from an
advance payment or advance receipt of a consideration before the entity recognizes the related asset,
income or expense. The time of the transaction for the purposes of determining the exchange rate is the
initial recognition of the non-monetary asset arising from the advance payment or of the non-monetary
liability arising from deferred income. If there are several advance payments or receipts, a transaction time
is determined for every payment and every receipt. This Interpretation is not applicable if an entity
measures the related asset, income or expense at fair value at the time of initial recognition or at the fair
value of the consideration received or paid at a time other than the time of initial recognition of the
non-monetary asset or of the non-monetary liability. Furthermore, the Interpretation is not required to be
applied to income taxes, insurance contracts and pension liability insurance contracts. IFRIC 22 is
applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Earlier adoption is permitted. This
Interpretation is not expected to have any major effects on the Group.

**IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments**

This Interpretation contains a clarification as to how the probability/uncertainty in accounting for
uncertain tax assets is to be taken into account. The previous rules under IAS 12 had contained a related
loophole according to which every tax balance sheet item is uncertain until a final assessment is available.
IFRIC 23 is applicable for taxable profits or tax losses, fiscal assessment bases, tax losses to be used, tax
credits to be used and tax rates if their measurement under IAS 12 involves uncertainty over income tax
treatment. The basic assumption is that a fiscal authority is both entitled to, and is aware of, any relevant
information. IFRIC 23 is applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Earlier
adoption is permitted. This Interpretation is not expected to have any major effects on the Group.

The new regulations listed below are not applicable to the Group and will therefore not impact on the
Group’s net assets, financial position and results from operations:

- IFRS improvements (2014-2016): Revision of IFRS 1 and IAS 28,

- Revision of IAS 40—Transfer of Investment Property,

- Revision of IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Agreements,

- Revisions of IFRS 4: Application of IFRS 9—Financial Instruments together with IFRS 4—Insurance
Contracts,

- Revision of IFRS 9—Prepayment Rules with Negative Compensation Payment.

The IASB published the Standards and Interpretations listed below which had yet not been mandatorily
applicable in the financial year 2017. These Standards and Interpretations have not been recognized by the
EU to date and are not applied by CHEPLAPHARM Group. The detailed presentation is restricted to
those Standards and Interpretations which might on principle be applicable at CHEPLAPHARM Group
level in the future:

**IFRS improvements (2015-2017)**

These IFRS improvements (2015-2017) constitute a joint Standard, which was published in December 2017
and addresses changes to various IFRSs which are applicable for financial years beginning on or after
1 January 2019. These IFRS improvements include the following revisions:

- IFRS 3: Clarification that an entity getting control over a joint activity is required to remeasure its
previously held equity shares.

- IFRS 11: Clarification that an entity getting joint control over a joint activity does not remeasure its
previously held equity shares.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**2. Policies and methods (Continued)**

- IAS 12: Clarification that the income tax consequences of dividends are rather related to the original
transactions which led to distributable profits. Therefore, an entity recognized the income tax
consequences of dividend payments, depending on the underlying transaction, either in profit or loss,
in other comprehensive income or in equity.

- IAS 23: Clarification that an entity is required to include existing residual external capital which had
specifically been raised for procuring an asset in determining the weighted average of all borrowing
costs from the time when basically all activities performed for getting this asset ready for its intended
use or sale have been completed.

The Group intends to adopt this revision Standard as of its official effective date. This joint Standard is not
expected to have any major effects on the Group’s net assets, financial position and results from
operations.

The new regulations listed below are not applicable to the Group and will therefore not impact on the
Group’s net assets, financial position and results from operations:

- Revision of IAS 19—Plan Changes, Curtailments or Settlements,

- Revision of IAS 28—Non-current Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures,

- IFRS 17—Insurance Contracts.

The requirements of all Standards and Interpretations applied were fully met and lead to conveyance of a
true and fair view of CHEPLAPHARM Group’s net assets, financial position and results from operations.
There was no deviation from these Standards on account of overriding principles.

**3. Consolidation methods**

The subject of the consolidated financial statements are CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH (hereafter
referred to as ‘‘CHEPLAPHARM’’) and its subsidiaries. All subsidiaries which are legally controlled by
CHEPLAPHARM are regularly included in the consolidated financial statements.

Subsidiaries acquired are accounted for according to the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition
corresponds to the fair value of the assets given up, of the equity instruments issued and of the liabilities
incurred or assumed at the time of the transaction. At the time of initial consolidation, assets, liabilities,
and contingent liabilities identifiable as part of a business combination are measured at fair value at the
time of transaction, irrespective of the scope of minority interest.

The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net assets acquired and measured
at fair value is recognized as goodwill.

If the costs of the acquisition are lower than the subsidiary’s net assets acquired and measured at fair value,
the difference is directly recognized in the income statement.

The effects of intragroup transactions are eliminated. Assets and liabilities between consolidated entities
are offset against each other. Unrealized profits or losses on intragroup transactions are eliminated.
Intragroup income is eliminated against corresponding expenses. Appropriate taxes on temporary
differences arising on consolidation are deferred in accordance with IAS 12.

**4. Currency translation of foreign subsidies’ sets of financial statements**

Glenwood LLC, Englewood, New Jersey/U.S., is the only consolidated subsidiary that has its registered
office outside the eurozone. The annual financial statements of this entity are translated into euro
according to the functional currency concept. The functional currency of Glenwood LLC is the U.S. dollar
(USD) because all major trade relationships are based on this entity’s local currency.

**CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald/Germany**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**4. Currency translation of foreign subsidies’ sets of financial statements (Continued)**

Assets and liabilities are translated using the rates in effect at the reporting date, the income statements
are translated at annual average rates, from the functional into the reporting currency EUR. Resulting
translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The EUR/USD rate at the reporting date is 0.8338 EUR/USD as at 31 December 2017 (prior year:
0.9487 EUR/USD). The average rate for the year 2017 is 0.8852 EUR/USD (prior year: 0.8790 EUR/
USD).

In the statement of movements in fixed assets, the balance at the beginning of the consolidation and at the
end of the financial year is translated using the respective rate in effect at the reporting date and the other
items are translated at average rates. A difference arising from exchange rate changes is disclosed as a
translation difference in a separate column both under cost and under accumulated amortization,
depreciation and write-downs.

**5. Entities included in consolidation**

All entities which are controlled by CHEPLAPHARM (subsidiaries) are included in the consolidated
financial statements.

CHEPLAPHARM achieves control when it has the power over the investee, is exposed, or has right to
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its
returns.

CHEPLAPHARM performs a re-assessment as to whether or not it controls an investee if there are facts
and circumstances which indicate that one or several of the three criteria of control referred to above have
changed.

An entity is consolidated from the time CHEPLAPHARM is able to control this entity. If this ability
ceases to exist, the entity concerned retires from the group of consolidated entities.

Besides CHEPLAPHARM as the parent company, the group of entities included in the consolidation as at
31 December 2017 comprises 7 (prior year: 6) domestic and 2 (prior year: 2) foreign subsidiaries which are
controlled by CHEPLAPHARM on account of the majority of voting rights.

**Changes in the group of entities included in the consolidation**

As of 22 December 2017, CHEPLAPHARM Group acquired a 100% share in Helm Medical GmbH,
Hamburg/Germany, for further expansion purposes. This acquired company has been included in the
consolidated financial statements since the time of its acquisition.

This had no major impact on results from operations in 2017.

Had Helm Medical GmbH already initially been included in the consolidated financial statements as of
1 January 2017, it would have realized revenue of kEUR 11,292 and earnings after income taxes of
kEUR 1,061 in the period from 1 January to 31 December 2017, after taking into account consolidation
effects.

**Transaction-related cash outflow . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **2,252**

The fair value of trade receivables and other assets acquired and of other assets corresponds to the
respective gross amounts of the assets. Material losses of contractual cash flows are not anticipated.

The goodwill, which, in terms of content, reflects the anticipated synergy effects from the acquisition of the
entity, is disclosed under intangible assets in the balance sheet. The goodwill is not tax-deductible.

The purchase price allocation used for the determination of goodwill in the amount of kEUR 1,793 which
was allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units is provisional.

The purchase price allocation of the companies RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH and RubiePharm
Vertriebs GmbH, both Steinau an der Straße/Germany, which had been acquired as of 30 September 2016,
was completed in the reporting year. The goodwill of kEUR 875 resulting from this transaction was
allocated to the contract manufacturing cash-generating unit, which is identical to the company
RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH. There were no further changes in the purchase price allocation.

**6. Accounting and measurement methods**

The sets of individual financial statements of the entities included in the consolidation are prepared
according to uniform accounting and measurement principles. The values recognized in the consolidated
financial statements are solely determined by the economic presentation of the net assets, financial
position and results from operations within the scope of the provisions of the IASB.

**Income and expense recognition**

Revenue is regularly recognized at the time performance is rendered or risks pass to customers.

After acquiring drug licenses, CHEPLAPHARM often enters into a so-called ‘‘transition service and
supply agreement’’ (TSA) with the seller, under which the interim period in respect of product distribution.
The seller sells the drugs in its own name on the account of CHEPLAPHARM until the necessary

F-82

**CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald/Germany**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**6. Accounting and measurement methods (Continued)**

marketing authorizations for CHEPLAPHARM are available. CHEPLAPHARM is not permitted to sell
the drugs in its own name until the corresponding conditions under drug law are met. Until these
conditions are met, the inventories continue to be accounted for at the level of the seller because the seller
bears all risks in respect of the inventories. Only after the conditions under drug law have been met are the
inventories billed and transferred to CHEPLAPHARM. In the period between the acquisition of the drug
license and the acquisition of the inventories, CHEPLAPHARM receives from the seller of the license the
gross profit (revenue of the seller less its sales input = net value) from the sale of the drugs.
CHEPLAPHARM makes out corresponding invoices to the seller. These invoices are recognized as
revenue in the amount of the net value (net of cash discounts and rebates).

Operating expenses are expensed at the time the service is received or at the time of its origination.

Interest income and interest expenses are recognized by means of the effective interest method.

Dividends are realized at the time the claim arises.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired for a consideration are capitalized at cost if it is probable that the use of the
asset is related to a future economic benefit and the costs of the asset can be reliably determined.
Borrowing costs are regularly capitalized only if they relate to the acquisition or production of a qualified
asset.

The assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of 2 to 15 years.
Impairment losses are taken into account.

The underlying useful lives correspond to the useful lives expected at group level. The appropriateness of
the useful lives and the carrying amount are reviewed at annual intervals. Necessary changes in estimates
are proactively taken into account.

Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at annual intervals. Reference is made to the
following statements regarding impairment and to Note 16.

An intangible asset is required to be derecognized if no further economic benefit is anticipated from its use
or its disposal any more. The gain on, or loss from, derecognition of an intangible asset is recognized in the
income statement at the time the asset is derecognized.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less wear-related deprecation and write-downs which
are made on a case-by-case basis.

Production costs include all allocable costs as well as appropriate portions of production-related
overheads. Borrowing costs are capitalized only if they relate to acquisition or production of a qualified
asset.

Elements of property, plant and equipment with a limited useful life are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated economic life unless another depreciation method is appropriate in exceptional
cases on account of the actual pattern of benefits provided.

The underlying useful lives correspond to the useful lives expected at group level. The appropriateness of
the useful lives and the carrying amount are examined at annual intervals. Necessary changes in estimates
are prospectively taken into account.

**Impairment of non-current non-financial assets**

The recoverability of assets is examined in accordance with IAS 36 if there are events indicating, or
indications of, an impairment. Write-downs are made if the future realizable amount of an asset is lower
than its carrying amount. The amount realizable from an asset corresponds to the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and present value of the future cash flows attributable to the asset (value in use). If it is
impossible to allocate to specific assets own future cash inflows which are generated independently of
other assets, their recoverability has to be tested on the basis of the next higher aggregated cash-generating
unit of assets. If the reasons for an impairment cease to exist, corresponding write-ups are made (except
for goodwill).

**Leases**

In accordance with IAS 17, the beneficial ownership of leased assets is attributed to the lessee if the lessee
essentially bears all risks, and seizes all opportunities, arising from the leased asset which are related to
ownership. If beneficial ownership is attributable to CHEPLAPHARM Group, it is capitalized at the lower
of the present value of the lease rentals plus incidental costs possibly to be borne by the lessee and the fair
value of the leased asset at the time when the lessee is entitled to exercise its right to use the leased asset.
The corresponding leasing liability, which is measured according to the effective interest method
subsequent to initial recognition, is recognized at an equivalent amount. The leasing payments are
classified by interest expenses and repayment of the leasing obligation in such a way that constant payment
of interest on the remaining liability is achieved. Interest expenses are expensed as incurred.

The amortization methods and useful lives of capitalized leasing assets correspond to those of comparable
assets acquired.

Rental income and rental expenses under operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the corresponding agreements.

**Non-current non-derivative financial assets**

Non-current non-derivative financial assets are capitalized at fair value, which corresponds to cost, at the
date of settlement, i.e. at the time assets originate or are transferred.

For the purposes of measurement as at the reporting date subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets
are classified by loans and receivables extended by the entity, by assets held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose which the respective
instrument was acquired for.

Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables extended and held-to-maturity financial
instruments are measured at amortized cost as at every reporting date. However, available-for-sale assets
are recognized at fair value as at the reporting dates subsequent to initial recognition, with changes in the
value of instruments held for trading being charged or credited in the income statement.

Available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at fair value as at the reporting date if this value can be
reliably determined. Fluctuations in the value between the reporting dates are allocated to reserves
without profit or loss impact. The reserves are released through the income statement either at the time of
disposal or if the fair value sustainably decreases below the carrying amount.

**CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald/Germany**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**6. Accounting and measurement methods (Continued)**

Allowances with profit or loss impact are made on extended loans and receivables to the extent that the
amount realizable as at the reporting date decreases below the carrying amount.

**Derivative financial instruments**

CHEPLAPHARM regularly uses derivative financial instruments for hedging against interest rate risks.

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 39, derivative financial instruments are regularly recognized at
fair value (without taking into account incidental costs) in the balance sheet and accounted for at fair value
accordingly as at the reporting date thereafter.

Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are directly recognized in the net profit or loss
for the period. Positive and negative fair values are disclosed on the asset and on the liability sides,
respectively, taking into account deferred taxes. There is no hedging.

**Derecognition of financial assets**

A financial asset (or a part of a financial asset or a part of a group of similar financial assets) is
derecognized (i.e. removed from the group balance sheet) if one of the following requirements is met:

- The contractual rights in respect of cash flows from a financial asset have expired, or

- the Group has transferred its contractual rights in respect of cash flows from a financial asset to third
parties.

**Income taxes**

In accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the individual
entities’ tax balance sheet values and the values recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Tax
loss carryforwards which are likely to be realizable in the future are capitalized in the amount of the
deferred tax asset.

Asset-side deferred taxes are eliminated against liability-side deferred taxes if they belong to the same
taxable entity and this taxable entity is entitled to offset current tax assets against tax liabilities and they
relate to income taxes which are levied by the same fiscal authority.

The deferred tax rates ranged from 13.3% to 16.4% (prior year: from 13.3% to 16.4%) for German
municipal trade tax and were at 15.8% (prior year: 15.8%) for German corporate income tax and the
solidarity surcharge. There are no deferred taxes at the level of the two foreign subsidiaries.

Current income taxes have been disclosed as income tax liabilities to the extent that they have not yet been
paid over. If the income tax amounts already paid exceed the amounts owed, the differences have been
recognized as income tax assets.

**Current assets**

Current assets include inventories, current non-derivative financial assets as well as current non-financial
assets.

**Inventories**

The item inventories comprises raw materials, consumables and supplies, work in progress and finished
goods and merchandise as well as prepayments.

Inventories are recognized at cost. As at the reporting date, they are measured at the lower of cost and net
realizable value.

The net realizable value corresponds to the sales revenue realizable in course of the ordinary business less
directly allocable costs to sell.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**6. Accounting and measurement methods (Continued)**

Besides directly allocable costs, cost also includes appropriate portions of indirect material and production
overheads at normal utilization of the production facilities concerned to the extent that these are incurred
in connection with the production process. Costs of company pension plans, for social facilities of the
business and voluntary social benefits of the entity as well as general and administrative expenses are also
taken into account to the extent that these relate to the area of production. Finance costs are not included
in cost.

**Current non-derivative financial assets**

Current non-derivative financial assets classified as current assets comprise receivables, securities as well as
bank balances and cash-in-hand.

All current financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, which, for non-derivative financial
instruments, corresponds to acquisition cost, at the date of settlement, i.e. at the time the account
receivable originates or beneficial ownership is transferred. The acquisition cost of monetary receivables
bearing minor or no interest corresponds to their present value at the time of origination.

Subsequent to initial recognition, current financial assets are measured depending on the categorization
analogous to non-current financial assets.

**—Receivables**

Receivables are initially recognized at fair value and according to the amortized cost method subsequent to
initial recognition, using the effective interest method and taking into account any impairment losses.

If there are doubts as to the recoverability of receivables, these are recognized at the lower realizable
amount by making a corresponding specific allowance.

Receivables denominated in foreign currency are measured at the middle rate at the reporting date.

**—Securities**

Securities are recognized at market value.

**—Bank balances and cash-in-hand**

Cash has been recognized at nominal amount. Foreign currency balances have been measured at the
middle rate at the reporting date.

**Current non-financial assets**

Current non-financial assets primarily relate to tax assets as well as to other non-contractual claims and
prepaid expenses.

Current non-financial assets are recognized at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at
amortized cost, taking into account appropriate allowances.

**Liabilities**

Liabilities comprise financial liabilities and other non-financial liabilities.

**Non-derivative financial liabilities**

Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequent to
initial recognition, these are accounted for at amortized cost. For non-current credits, any difference
between the amount paid out (after deducting transaction cost) and the amount to be repaid is recognized
in the income statement according to the effective interest rate method over the term of the credit.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**6. Accounting and measurement methods (Continued)**

Non-derivative financial liabilities denominated in foreign currency are measured at the middle rate at the
reporting date. Changes in value on account of currency effects are recognized with profit or loss impact.

**Other non-financial liabilities**

Other non-financial liabilities which are not based on contractual commitments and the direct or indirect
subject of which is the exchange of cash are disclosed under the item other liabilities unless these are tax
liabilities.

Non-financial liabilities are initially recognized at the amount which corresponds to the anticipated outflow
of resources. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in value which result from new findings are
charged or credited in the income statement. The amount required to be recognized is the amount of the
best possible estimate which is necessary for settling the liability as at the reporting date.

Liabilities denominated in foreign currency are measured at the middle rate at the reporting date.

**Material judgments and estimates**

In applying the accounting and valuation methods, Management made the following judgments and
estimates which impact on the amount and the disclosure of recognized assets and liabilities, of income
and expenses, and of contingent liabilities:

**—Measurement of intangible assets (see Note 16)**

In acquiring drug licenses, CHEPLAPHARM determines the useful life of these intangible assets
according to criteria such as market share, possible market entry of potential competitors, legal and
country risks as well as revenue and sales budgeted for the respective medicine. Judgments are generally
made in determining the useful life.

**—Goodwill (see Note 16)**

The impairment test of goodwill is based on forward-looking assumptions. These tests are performed by
CHEPLAPHARM annually and additionally on occasions which indicate that goodwill might have been
impaired. The determination of the value in use of the cash-generating unit includes definitions and
estimates in respect of the forecast and discounting of future cash flows. Although Management
anticipates that the assumptions underlying the calculation of the realizable amount are appropriate,
potential unforeseeable changes in these assumptions, for instance a reduction in EBITDA margins, a rise
in capital costs or decrease in the long-term growth rate, lead to an impairment loss which could
sustainably influence the net assets, financial position and results from operations.

Estimates are based on empirical data and other assumptions which are deemed to be appropriate under
the given circumstances. They are continuously verified, but may deviate from actual values.

Further explanations concerning assumptions and estimates made are provided in the statements regarding
the individual items of the financial statements. All assumptions and estimates are based on circumstances
and assessments at the reporting date. Furthermore, in assessing the future business development, the
economic environment in the industries and regions CHEPLAPHARM Group operates in which was
supposed to be realistic at this time has been taken into account. At the time the consolidated financial
statements were prepared, the underlying assumptions and estimates were not expected to change
significantly.

In the prior year, the deferred taxes on loss carryforwards capitalized had related to corporate income tax
and municipal trade tax loss carryforwards of Sanavita Pharmaceuticals GmbH.

Besides the loss carryforwards which have been taken into account in capitalizing deferred taxes, there
were corporate income and trade tax loss carryforwards at the level of RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH at
a respective amount of kEUR 830 (prior year: kEUR 808) and at the level of Sanavita GmbH at a
respective amount of kEUR 1,251 (prior year: kEUR 0) as of December 31, 2017. The related deferred
taxes totaling kEUR 635 (prior year: kEUR 235) were not capitalized on account of these Companies’ loss
history.

Asset- and liability-side deferred taxes are eliminated against each other if they belong to the same taxable
entity and this taxable entity is authorized to eliminate current tax assets against tax liabilities.

**16. Intangible assets (Continued)**

Goodwill of kEUR 875 relates to the acquisition of two companies RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH and
RubiePharm Vertriebs GmbH and to goodwill of kEUR 1,793 resulting from the acquisition of Helm
Medical GmbH as of 22 December 2017 (see Note 5).

The goodwill of kEUR 875 arising on acquisition of the two companies RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH
and RubiePharm Vertriebs GmbH was allocated to the contract manufacturing cash-generating unit, which
is identical to the company RubiePharm Arzneimittel GmbH.

As at 31 December 2017, the goodwill of Helm Medical GmbH had not yet finally fully been allocated to
the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units. Therefore, the purchase price allocation (see
Note 5) is provisional.

In the reporting year, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.

As part of this impairment test, the goodwill arising on acquisition of the two companies RubiePharm
Arzneimittel GmbH and RubiePharm Vertriebs GmbH was based on the present value of the future net
cash inflows because there is no market price.

The value in use determined for the cash-generating unit which includes the goodwill of the RubiePharm
companies significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit. An increase in the
discount factor by 1.0 percentage points would also not lead to an impairment requirement as at
31 December 2017.

The value in use was determined by means of budget figures for a 2-year period, using a pretax discount
rate of 8.07% and a growth factor after the detailed planning period of 1.00% p.a. The discount factor was
developed by means of market data. Weighted capital costs (WACC, Weighted Average Cost of Capital)
are calculated according to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The growth factor corresponds to the
expected long-term average inflation rate.

The impairment test for the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Helm Medical GmbH was based on
fair value less costs to sell. Since this entity was acquired as of 22 December 2017 as part of a market
transaction, the determination of the fair value less costs to sell was based on the market price of the
acquisition transaction.

With the exception of goodwill, intangible assets generally have a limited useful life and are therefore
amortized over the useful life.

CHEPLAPHARM has no significant influence on the investments. The carrying amounts largely
correspond to fair value.

**19. Leased assets**

The rental agreements and leases existing at the level of CHEPLAPHARM Group relate to business
premises, the vehicle fleet and other assets (mainly SAP software and machinery). The corresponding
leases are classified as operating leases because basically all risks and opportunities related to ownership
remain with the lessor. There are no purchase options at the end of the lease terms, except for the leases
concerning machinery. The rental agreements do not provide for price adjustment clauses or extension
options.

The leasing payments are expensed on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the periods.

The future rental and leasing payments for the next few years can be analyzed as follows:

**20. Derivative financial instruments (Continued)**

The derivative financial instruments disclosed under other non-current assets, and under other current
assets total kEUR 68 (prior year: kEUR 204), and kEUR 0 (prior year: kEUR 22), respectively.

The derivative financial instruments solely relate to interest- and currency-related transactions as well as to
OTC products, i.e. products which are not traded on a stock exchange.

Derivative financial instruments have been measured at the fair market value determined. This value is
based on internal risk models which are determined according to recognized mathematical methods. The
method applied for this purpose is the discounted cash flow method, where future cash flows are estimated
on the basis of forward exchange rates (rates observable at the reporting date) and contracted forward
exchange rates and discounted using an interest rate which takes into account the various counterparties’
credit risk.

The carrying amounts of the derivatives correspond to fair market values.

**23. Trade receivables (Continued)**

The entity continuously assesses the credit standing of its customers and normally requests no collaterals.
The entity made allowances for potential loss of receivables outstanding. Such losses of receivables
corresponded to Management’s estimates and assumptions and are within the normal scope of the
business.

The following table shows the changes in allowances on trade receivables:

**2017** **2016**

Allowances on trade receivables are normally recognized in allowance accounts. The decision as to
whether a default risk is initially taken into account by means of an allowance account or directly taken
into account by reducing the account receivable depends on the degree of probability of a loss of an
account receivable outstanding. If receivables are classified as irrecoverable, the corresponding impaired
asset is derecognized.

The following table shows the ageing of the trade receivables:

**33. Other financial liabilities (Continued)**

CHEPLAPHARM’s bank financing mainly comprises two different instruments.

Until and including 2014, CHEPLAPHARM’s corporate financing via bilateral amortizing loans with
various banks had been project-related. The residual financial liabilities as at the reporting date
31 December 2017 total kEUR 674 (31 December 2016: kEUR 8,092). The collaterals furnished for the
remaining financial liabilities from bilateral amortizing loans are pledged trademarks and licenses of the
drugs Vesanoid and Rohypnol acquired through the transaction (carrying amount as at 31 Dec. 2017:
kEUR 34,054; carrying amount as at 31 Dec. 2016: kEUR 40,565), Mr Sebastian Braun’s subordination, a
profit retention and equity maintenance agreement including Mr Sebastian Braun’s collateral purpose
agreement, and Mr Norbert Braun’s loan maintenance and subordination agreement.

On 28 January 2015, a new, also project-related instrument in the form of the syndicated loan agreement
was established within the bank financing. On 30 June 2017, the syndicated loan dated 28 January 2015 was
increased by mEUR 47.5 to a total principal of mEUR 329.44 under the 4[th] supplement. All seven tranches
have a respective term of 20 quarters and a corresponding straight-line repayment profile. The new
tranche A7 has a term until 30 September 2022 and will be paid out on 2 January 2018. This tranche
accrues interest at a variable rate. In addition, the syndicated loan agreement provides for a working
capital line of credit of up to mEUR 5 in the form of an overdraft facility.

On 28 November 2017, bilateral interim financing totaling mEUR 100 was agreed with Deutsche Bank.
The purpose of this interim financing is to partly repay the syndicated financing and to acquire further
licenses in January 2018. The interim financing includes an amount of mEUR 50 which was issued in the
form of notes. The amount is paid out in two partial amounts. The first partial amount of mEUR 50 was
paid out on 29 December 2017. The second partial amount will be paid out on 3 January 2018. The term is
9 months plus a 3-month extension option. The interest rate is 1-month EURIBOR plus 2.25% p.a.

The syndicated loan agreement provides for compliance with financial covenants and, in the event of
non-compliance with these financial covenants, the lenders are granted an extraordinary right to give
notice of termination. Compliance with the financial covenants is continuously monitored and controlled
by Management within the framework of the budget planning and by means of actual data and is regularly
reported to the lending banks. In the financial year 2017 and in the prior year, the entity fully complied
with the relevant financial covenants. Based on the budget planning adopted, CHEPLAPHARM Group
anticipates that these will also be complied with in 2018 and beyond.

The financial liabilities within the syndicated loan have been collateralized through a loan maintenance
and subordination agreement including collateral purpose agreement of Mr Sebastian Braun, of
Mr Norbert Braun, of Braun Beteiligungs GmbH, and of Braun Hanse Holding GmbH, as well as through
a profit retention and equity maintenance agreement.

To hedge against the interest rate risk, CHEPLAPHARM Group performed interest rate cap and interest
rate swap transactions with selected syndicated banks for a nominal amount of mEUR 176.9 as at
31 December 2017 (mEUR 185.4 as at 31 December 2016) with different terms. For details, reference is
made to Note 20.

**34. Deferred tax liabilities**

For an analysis of deferred tax liabilities see Note 15.

**35. Other non-current financial liabilities**

Non-current other liabilities solely include non-current derivative financial instruments. For further details,
reference is made to Note 20.

**Determination of fair value**

The carrying amount of non-current financial instruments corresponds to fair value.

The carrying amount of financial instruments such as assets and liabilities corresponds to fair value on
account of the current maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying amount of financial liabilities
largely corresponds to fair value because these predominantly bear interest at variable rates.

The entity monitors the variations in fixed- and variable-interest liabilities as well as in non-current and
current liabilities. Related business and other finance risks are verified.

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing fair values of financial instruments
for each measurement procedure:

Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities,

Level 2: Procedures where all input parameters which have a material influence on the fair value
recognized are either directly or indirectly observable,

Level 3: Procedures using input parameters which have a material influence on the fair value recognized
and are not based on an observable market data.

**40. Supplementary notes to financial instruments (Continued)**

As at 31 December 2017, derivatives (see Note 20) and securities (see Note 26) were measured at fair
value at the level of CHEPLAPHARM Group. The fair values of derivatives are derived from observable
market data and are thus attributable to hierarchy level 2. Securities are measured at market price and are
thus attributable to hierarchy level 1.

Both in the reporting year and in the prior year, no instruments were reclassified between these three
levels.

**Notes to the income statement**

The following table shows the net gains or losses from financial instruments taken into account in the
income statement:

**2017** **2016**
**kEUR** **kEUR**
Financial assets and liabilities held for trading (FAHfT/FLHfT) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �160 �52

�17,352 �5,783

The net losses allocable to the category ‘‘financial assets and liabilities held for trading’’ result from
derivative financial instruments accounted for and relate to fair value changes.

The net gains of the category ‘‘loans and receivables’’ include interest income. In CHEPLAPHARM’s
consolidated financial statements, income from allowances attributable to the category ‘‘loans and
receivables’’ is disclosed under other operating income and expenses related to receivables written down
are disclosed under other operating expenses.

The net gains attributable to the category ‘‘available for sale’’ include income from securities which is
disclosed under net income from investments.

The net losses attributable to the category ‘‘financial liabilities at cost’’ result from interest paid on
financial liabilities.

Interest from financial instruments is disclosed under interest result (see Note 14).

**41. Financial risk management and financial derivatives**

**General notes to risk management**

CHEPLAPHARM combines the measures for managing risks which exist at the level of the entity in a risk
management system. The basic instruments of CHEPLAPHARM’s risk management are regular
reporting, forecast, planning and strategy processes. The system provides for regular identification and
assessment of new and known risks through responsible staff. In addition, the corporate functions of
CHEPLAPHARM Group report on financial and operative developments on a monthly basis. Through
these measures, Management is informed at regular intervals and at an early stage about the risk position
and can take appropriate measures for risk mitigation and avoidance or prevention.

In respect of its assets, liabilities, planned transactions and existing obligations, CHEPLAPHARM is
especially exposed to credit risks, default risks, cash risks as well risks from changing interest rates. The
goal of financial risk management is to mitigate these market risks through current operative and financeorientated activities. According to Management’s assessment, there is no risk concentration. By means of
the measures referred to above, it is regularly examined whether risk clusters develop.

**41. Financial risk management and financial derivatives (Continued)**

Fundamental finance policies are determined by Management at annual intervals. Management is
responsible for implementing, and controlling during the year, the financial policies as well as current risk
management.

**Credit risk**

The liquid funds mainly contain cash and cash equivalents. In connection with the investment of liquid
funds, the Group is exposed to losses resulting from credit risks if financial institutions fail to meet their
obligations.

Trade receivables arise from ordinary business activities and predominantly relate to solvent small to
medium-sized entities. Uncollected receivables are nevertheless continuously monitored; furthermore, the
Group has established an active dunning system. Default risks are covered by making specific allowances.
The maximum default risk is reflected by the carrying amounts of the financial assets recognized in the
balance sheet.

**Liquidity risk**

The liquidity risk of CHEPLAPHARM Group consists in the fact that the entity is possibly unable to meet
its financial obligations, for instance repayment of financial liabilities, payment of purchase commitments,
and obligations under leases. To avoid a realization of this risk and to ensure that the Group is at any time
able to pay and flexible in financial terms, a cash reserve in the form of cash and credit lines is provided. In
addition, the Group’s liquidity is continuously monitored by means of liquidity forecasts. As at
31 December 2017, the undrawn current credit lines available to the Group amounted to kEUR 6,225
(prior year: kEUR 6,275).

The (non-discounted) repayments and interest payments resulting from financial liabilities during the next
few years are as follows:

Interest payable on variable-interest financial liabilities was computed using current interest rates as at the
reporting date.

The payment rows for liabilities related to mezzanine capital and financial debts reflect the respective
contractual situation as at the reporting dates stated. In 2018 (subsequent event; see also Note 47), there
was a comprehensive refinancing, which led to premature redemption of liabilities, resulting, in July 2018,
in cash outflows of kEUR 515,282, which are matched by cash inflows of kEUR 540,000.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**for the financial year 2017**

**41. Financial risk management and financial derivatives (Continued)**

**Financial market risks**

CHEPLAPHARM is generally exposed to market price risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and
interest rates. These may result in negative effects on the Group’s net assets, financial position and results
from operations.

The major transactions of CHEPLAPHARM Group are performed in the eurozone. For the entity in the
U.S., the functional currency is the USD. Consequently, there are currency risks between the USD and the
EUR. Since the entities in the U.S. predominantly perform their activities in their functional currency, the
exchange risk of the Group from its normal operating activities is deemed to be insignificant.

Besides, there are transactions in foreign currencies which manly result from the Group’s operating
activities, namely from transactions in CHF, USD, and GBP. Management regularly monitors the potential
currency risks and, if necessary, takes active hedging measures in order to minimize risks. The resulting
residual currency risk is generally deemed by Management to be insignificant on account of the low
volumes of the corresponding assets and liabilities.

The interest rate risk of the Group primarily results from financial liabilities which accrue variable interest
on the basis of the EURIBOR. The Group is exposed to these interest rate risks in the eurozone.

Had the market interest rate level as at 31 December 2017 been 50 base points higher, earnings would have
been kEUR 1,179 (31 December 2016: kEUR 380) lower. This hypothetical effect on earnings is due to the
potential effects of variable-interest liabilities. Due to lack of measurement of financial instruments
without profit and loss impact, there are no direct effects on consolidated equity beyond this earnings
effect. The increase in the amount in comparison with the prior year is due to the fact that new financial
debts were raised.

As at 31 December 2017 (as well as in 2016), there was, in the entity’s opinion, no significant other price
risk.

**42. Capital management**

The main objective of CHEPLAPHARM Group’s capital management is to secure the ability to repay
debts and to pay interest and to maintain the financial resources in the future.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments, taking into account overall economic
conditions. As at 31 December 2017, the goals, guidelines and procedures remained unchanged. The goal
is to appropriately adapt the capital structure to the business risk.

CHEPLAPHARM is subject to statutory capital requirements for limited liability companies. Compliance
with these requirements is continuously monitored. In the reporting period, these requirements were met.

The capital managed by the Group is the economic equity and this capital is monitored by means of the
debt-equity ratio, which corresponds to the ratio of net debt to economic equity as well as of the total
amount of net debt and equity ratio. Net debt comprise current and non-current financial liabilities less
liquid funds. In addition to equity, the economic equity includes the loans granted by related parties, which
are disclosed under non-current liabilities, and the mezzanine loan notes.

The following independent auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with
Section 322 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) in German language on the German version
of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (Konzernlagebericht) of
Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH as of and for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The group
management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

**Auditors’ report**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements, comprising the balance sheet, income statement,
statement of other comprehensive income, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes
to the financial statements, and the group management report of CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH,
Greifswald/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2017. The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) are the responsibility of the
Parent’s Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements
and the group management report based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 317 German
Commercial Code (HGB) and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements
promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets,
financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
German principles of proper accounting and in the group management report are detected with
reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the
Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit
procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence
supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are
examined primarily on a sample basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the
financial statements of the consolidated entities, the determination of entities to be included in
consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by
Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and
the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements of
CHEPLAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, Greifswald/Germany, comply with the IFRS, as adopted by the
EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) German
Commercial Code (HGB) and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the Group in accordance with German principles of proper accounting. The group
management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with the legal
requirements, as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.
