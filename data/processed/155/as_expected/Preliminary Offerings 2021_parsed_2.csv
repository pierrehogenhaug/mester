155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.1,,7.1.1,,"This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitations, statements about our markets and our strategy, future operations, industry forecasts and expected investments. Forwardlooking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “target” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled “Risk _Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-_ looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - adverse macroeconomic conditions and economic downturns, particularly in Italy; - the impact of COVID-19 and related risks; - competition from established companies as well as local specialized competitors; - economic and political risks in the emerging markets in which we operate; - increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations, especially in regards to the environment; - our ability to successfully maintain EHS policies and procedures; - our ability to obtain, renew or comply with the terms of the licenses, authorizations and permits required for our operations, and to develop and operate our facilities in compliance with conditions imposed by local governments; - operational, health and safety risks; - compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to our products and raw materials; - potential liabilities in connection with environmental matters; - changes in waste disposal patterns and commodity prices; - our ability to retain and renew existing contracts and to win new contracts; - the reputation of, and value associated with, our brand; - unforeseen integration obstacles or costs of acquired businesses; - counterparty risks and delayed payments or non-payments by our customers; - our ability to keep pace with technological, regulatory and market developments; - the incentives mechanisms provided by CONOU and its supply of waste oil; - the development of the electric vehicle market and renewable fuel technologies; - our ability to continue to retain and attract highly skilled employees; - third party infringement on our intellectual property rights; - our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls; - labor disputes and/or work stoppages; - security breaches of or damage to our IT systems; - more stringent regulations in the area of data privacy; - fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; - market perceptions concerning the stability of the euro; viii ----- - tax and social security audits; - the potential impact of litigation; - ownership of our vehicle fleet and equipment; - the adequacy of our insurance coverage and the cost thereof; - anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs; - liabilities associated with our directors, employees or other agents; - changes to the corporate tax system; - other risks associated with our financial information, the Transactions, our structure, the Financing, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral; and - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.” Accordingly, prospective investors should not rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum or as otherwise indicated. We do not have any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of such forward-looking statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, from time to time we and our representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other communications. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The factors listed above and the other risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. ix -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has no revenuegenerating activities of its own, it has not been involved in any operating activity since its incorporation and does not hold any material assets or liabilities. After the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will not have any subsidiaries and will have no assets (other than the proceeds of the offering of the Notes which will be deposited into the Escrow Account and will be pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes if the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date). The Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities upon the Completion Date are expected to be its equity interests in the Target and its outstanding indebtedness and inter-company balances incurred in connection with the Transactions, including its receivables under the Itelyum Proceeds Loans and its indebtedness under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, if any. As a result, this Offering Memorandum does not present any financial information of the Issuer, except for certain limited “as adjusted” financial data presented on a consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions on a pro forma basis. Prior to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer is currently not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the Transactions and any other future potential transactions permitted by the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.9,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION General,4.9.2,Target Group,"The historical financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is the consolidated financial information of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Target Group”). Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Target Group on a consolidated basis. The historical financial information of the Target Group included in this Offering Memorandum has been extracted or derived from: (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (the “Audited Financial Statements”); and (ii) the unaudited half-yearly condensed consolidated financial statements of the Target Group as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, which include unaudited comparative financial data for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The Audited Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Italian laws governing the preparation of financial statements, as interpreted and integrated by the accounting principles established by the Organismo _Italiano di Contabilità—OIC (“Italian GAAP”), and the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements have been_ prepared in accordance with OIC 30, “Interim Financial Reporting,” the Italian accounting standard that governs the preparation of interim financial statements. Our Audited Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. (“Deloitte”). In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain line items were reclassified and renamed in order to render them more easily comparable to the financial information of companies that apply IFRS. In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Prospective investors should consult their professional advisors for an understanding of (i) the differences between Italian GAAP, IFRS and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how these differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, Italian GAAP principles, or the adoption of IFRS principles, may have on our results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of prior periods. See “Annex A—Summary of Certain Differences _between Italian GAAP and IFRS.”_ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Italian GAAP requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical _Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates.”_ xvii ----- Our Consolidated Financial Statements have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer (prior to the completion of the Post Completion Merger) and MergerCo (following the completion of the Post Completion Merger), as applicable, will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under Italian GAAP and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our balance sheet, which may include, inter alia, intangible assets, such as goodwill. We may also recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, especially if we decide to provide consolidated financial statements for periods after the Completion Date at the level of the Issuer or (following the Post Completion Merger) MergerCo (instead of the Target), our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum.

Between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021, we acquired controlling stakes in or the entire share capital of ten companies (excluding the transactions where we only increased our stake in previously acquired companies and companies that were already controlled by the acquired companies). In particular, we made five such acquisitions in 2018 and five in 2020. Due to the changes in our scope of consolidation as a consequence of each of such acquisitions, our results of operations reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods under review may not be entirely comparable. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on acquisitions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.12,Perimeter Adjusted Financial Data,4.12.1,,"We have prepared certain perimeter adjusted financial data in this Offering Memorandum, including Unaudited _Pro forma Financial Data, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma revenue and adjusted_ recurring capital expenditure. Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data, Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma revenue and adjusted recurring capital expenditure provide more granularity regarding the performance of our business after adjusting for additions to our scope of consolidation, assuming that the Acquired Companies had been part of our consolidation perimeter since January 1, 2018. The Acquired Companies are companies we acquired in the period between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021 and, therefore, do not include Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021. No reconciliation has been provided in this Offering Memorandum from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data to the Target Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial _Information and Other Data—Other Financial Data” and “—Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data.”_ This Offering Memorandum also contains management estimates in the calculation of our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma revenue with respect to the additional Adjusted EBITDA and revenue, respectively, we expect to generate from the acquisition of Castiglia. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other _Data—Other Pro forma Financial Data” and “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.”_ xviii ----- While we believe that this perimeter adjusted financial data can be useful to potential investors seeking to evaluate our performance over time, such financial data is not intended to be compliant with Italian GAAP or any other accounting standards. Such perimeter adjusted financial data has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management. Our independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the perimeter adjusted financial data for the purpose of their inclusion in this Offering Memorandum. The perimeter adjusted financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines published by any other regulatory or industry body regarding estimates, the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation. The perimeter adjusted financial data is based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties and you are strongly cautioned against placing undue reliance thereon. The preparation of the perimeter adjusted financial data requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions with respect to issues such as the reconciliation of accounting policies (such as in respect of revenue recognition). For these reasons, the perimeter adjusted financial data is only a simulation of the Itelyum Group’s results had the relevant acquired businesses been owned for the whole period assumed and is not an indication of what our results would have been if the relevant acquired businesses had been part of the Target Group for such period. The perimeter adjusted financial data is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially had the relevant acquired businesses been owned for the entire period and there are significant differences between the perimeter adjusted financial data and the Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not own or control the Acquired Companies prior to the dates on which control passed in accordance with the relevant acquisition agreements. In some cases, such Acquired Companies were not operated as standalone businesses and therefore certain allocation of headquarters and similar costs have been estimated. Additionally, upon taking control of the Acquired Companies, we implemented our own industrial and distribution strategy which in some cases may have differed in material ways from the prior owners’ strategy. In addition, the pro forma adjustment relating to the impact of the acquisition of Castiglia used to calculate Pro _forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on the information available to us in connection with the acquisition of_ Castiglia, together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. Such adjustment is inherently uncertain and subject to a wide variety of significant uncertainties. Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur to, among other things, integrate Castiglia into the Target Group or any potential synergies or other impacts related to or expected to derive from the acquisition of Castiglia, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of Castiglia would have been for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, if we had acquired Castiglia on July 1, 2020. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated results will be realized.

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.15,Measures”). We use such measures to assess the financial performance and liquidity of our business. We believe,4.15.1,,"that these and similar measures are used widely by the investment community, securities analysts and other interested parties, as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt. An explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-GAAP Measures, a reconciliation of the Non-GAAP Measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with Italian GAAP and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Historical Financial _Information and Other Data.” We do not regard these Non-GAAP Measures as a substitute for, or superior to,_ the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with Italian GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with Italian GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles. Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows: - “EBITDA” is defined as profit (loss) for the period excluding income taxes, financial income, financial expenses and depreciation and amortization. - “EBITDA margin” is defined as EBITDA for the relevant period divided by revenue for the same period. - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA for the relevant period, adjusted for the CONOU regeneration treatment fee normalization, extraordinary provision for environmental liabilities, IAS 17 leases normalization, one-off costs and expenses relating to acquisitions and mergers, other one-off items and perimeter adjustments. For additional information, see “Summary Historical Financial and _Other Data—Other Financial Data.”_ - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period divided by pro _forma revenue for the same period._ - “Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact)” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period, further adjusted for normalized COVID-19 impact. Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact) is identical to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods under review other than for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2020. - “Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, further adjusted to give pro forma effect to the acquisition of Castiglia as if it occurred on July 1, 2020. For additional information, see “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data— _Other Pro forma Financial Data.”_ - “Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro _forma revenue (including Castiglia revenue)._ - “pro forma revenue” is defined as revenue for the relevant period, adjusted to give pro forma effect to the acquisitions of the Acquired Companies as if each of the Acquired Companies had been acquired on January 1, 2018, instead of their actual respective acquisition dates, which has been derived from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data. Pro forma revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, has been further adjusted to give pro forma effect to the acquisition of Castiglia as if it occurred on July 1, 2020. For additional information, see “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data— _Other Financial Data,” “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data—Other Pro forma Financial Data” and “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data—Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data.”_ xx ----- - “net working capital” is defined as the sum of trade receivables, inventories, trade payables, accrued income and prepaid expenses, accrued expense and deferred income and other current assets and other current liabilities. - “adjusted recurring capital expenditure” is defined as additions in property, plant and equipment and additions in other intangible assets, minus extraordinary capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure, and taking into account perimeter adjustments. - “adjusted operating cash flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact) for the relevant period less adjusted recurring capital expenditure. - “cash flow conversion rate” is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact). By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe EBITDA-based measures and other Non-GAAP Measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we believe EBITDA-based measures and other Non-GAAP Measures are regularly used by the investment community as a means of comparison of companies in our industry. Different companies and analysts may calculate EBITDA-based measures and other Non-GAAP Measures differently, so comparisons among companies on this basis should be done carefully. EBITDA-based measures and other Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance under Italian GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for operating profit or net profit as an indicator of our operations in accordance with Italian GAAP. Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Each of our Non-GAAP Measures is defined and reconciled to its closest comparable Italian GAAP measure under “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.” Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Some of the limitations of Non-GAAP Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Consolidated Financial Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our performance. xxi ----- Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our Consolidated Financial Statements or our accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts. Our use or computation of these measures may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Leveraging upon our distinctive chemical and recycling competences across our business units, we provide circular economy solutions to a wide and diversified client base across a variety of industries, including the automotive and pharmaceutical industries. Our mission is to act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps for the industrial waste streams, with particular focus on recycling and regeneration activities. Our services include the collection of waste, preliminary sorting and storage of waste, second level treatment of wastewater and oil emulsions, the preparation of waste for energy recovery or any other final destination plant through specific and specialized chemical treatments, waste oil re-refining (or regeneration) and waste solvent purification. Our products include lubricant-based oils, bitumen additives and gas oil, as well as a wide range of complex recovered waste-based thinners, solvent from waste and pure solvents. We also provide environmental consulting and chemical analysis services in respect of different types of matrices (e.g., water, soil and air) through our in-house network of accredited laboratories, and offer complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste and solvents. We are the leader in the Italian oil regeneration industry, with an approximately 89% market share as of December 31, 2019, and one of the market leaders in Europe by oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share (measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output as of December 31, 2019). We are also the leader in the Italian waste solvent purification industry, with a 50% market share by revenue and an approximately 37% market share by production capacity as of December 31, 2019, and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe, with a 34% market share as of December 2019. In addition, we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of hazardous waste in Italy in 2019 through our Environment business unit. The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits from higher barriers to entry compared to the industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste markets due to strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical skills required for the waste management processes. Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has demonstrated a high level of profitability and resiliency, including during periods of economic difficulties, recording a CAGR of approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014 compared to a negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP over the same period. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of €406.1 million, €85.0 million and €92.0 million, respectively. We have a large, diversified and established customer base comprising approximately 30,000 customers, ranging from large corporates to family-owned SMEs. We have long-standing relationships with the large majority of our top 20 customers, in certain cases spanning over a decade. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top 20 customers (excluding CONOU) accounted for 23.6% of our revenue. Our customers include oil companies and blenders, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, including blue chip brands such as Eni, Total, Petronas, Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi. While all of our operating sites are located in Italy, we benefit from a global commercial reach, serving over 60 countries through a 1 ----- network of local distributors. We have a strong geographical footprint in Italy, especially in its Northern regions. We currently operate 12 waste storage sites and 13 waste treatment and recycling facilities, including four plants for industrial wastewater treatment, two plants for lubricant oil regeneration, two plants for purification and blending of solvents and five treatment and pre-treatment plants. We have approximately 800 full-time employees (accounting for the acquisition of Castiglia in July 2021). We offer our products and services through three business units: - **Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a comprehensive range of environmental services, mostly in hazardous waste management and, to a lesser extent, in non-hazardous waste management covering a broad spectrum of the value chain, with an emphasis on recycling and recovery activities. Our Environment portfolio includes sustainable services and solutions for the industrial waste market such as (i) collection, transportation, first level treatment and storage, (ii) consulting services and laboratory analysis carried out through our network of ten accredited laboratories, (iii) industrial wastewater treatment and (iv) solid waste treatment. In addition, we offer complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste. Our exposure to third-party-operated landfills and incinerators is limited, accounting for approximately 12% of the total volume of our end-of-waste destinations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Environment business unit were €143.5 million and €29.6 million, respectively, representing 35.3% and 34.8%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. - **Regeneration. Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process that transforms waste oil, a hazardous waste, into a valuable product. Our used oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano primarily produce regenerated lubricant bases and, to a lesser extent, diesel oil and other by-products. We believe that the high quality and price competitiveness of our regenerated lubricant bases (comparable to virgin oils), underpinned by our proprietary re-refining technology enabling the Group to process a wide spectrum of feedstock qualities, represents a strong competitive advantage over many of our competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Regeneration business unit were €117.8 million and €34.5 million, respectively, representing 29.0% and 40.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. - **Purification. Our Purification business unit comprises the production and sale of a variety of solvents derived both from the valorization of chemical waste, including thinners and solvents from waste (“SFW”), and virgin raw materials, including pure aliphatics. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Purification business unit were €144.8 million and €20.9 million, respectively, representing 35.7% and 24.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. The following charts set forth our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA breakdown by business unit for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. 2 ----- We believe that the breadth of the services we offer and products we produce through our business units has enabled us to build a significant competitive advantage within the Italian waste management market, establishing our position as a leading one-stop shop service provider of circular economy solutions for a wide range of customers across various industries. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we directly managed approximately 837 thousand tons of waste materials, primarily consisting of lubricant oil, solvents, industrial hazardous water, waste treatment for energy valorization and other waste (excluding intermediated waste), with hazardous and non-hazardous waste accounting for 71% and 29%, respectively, of these volumes, and solid and liquid waste accounting for 19% and 81%, respectively, of these volumes. For the same period, we managed and processed approximately 1,174 thousand tons of waste (including intermediated waste).

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,837 ktons,9.3.1,"Front-runner in the circular economy solutions market, with distinctive competences in industrial hazardous waste recycling","We act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps for the industrial waste streams through our proprietary technologies and a strong network of partners for specific types of waste. We have a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities that enable us to offer circular solutions underpinned by the use of recycled products as industrial inputs. Our integrated platform: (i) drives significant commercial synergies across our business units, particularly in relation to sale channels, distributions and technological solutions; (ii) reinforces our value proposition to customers by covering a broad spectrum of waste management services; (iii) enables vertical integration by securing a steady supply of waste; (iv) facilitates centralized procurement efforts and capital expenditure optimization; (v) reduces transportation costs through fleet and route optimization; and (vi) drives efficiencies in our operations through the sharing of proprietary technologies and best practices. In addition, our scale and organizational structure often give us a competitive advantage over smaller players who may experience difficulties complying with increasingly stringent regulations. This is particularly the case of regulations imposing strict obligations on waste producers in relation to the waste cycle from collection to end-of-waste destinations. In these instances, 3 ----- structured players like us are able to provide customers with enhanced regulatory certainty and reduced compliance risks. The graphic below sets out our positioning across the waste management value chain for each relevant industry. We are at the forefront of the circular economy model. The integrated nature of our platform and the circularity of our business model enable us to provide sustainable solutions across our three business units. Supported by strong technological and operational competencies, we are able to extract value out of industrial waste for the production of sustainable products and resources. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 88%, 95% and 95% of the waste we managed in the Environment, Regeneration and Purification business units, respectively, was transformed into products, returned to the environment as purified water or sent to energy recovery, resulting in an overall circularity index of approximately 90%. Over this period, (i) within our Environment business unit, 48% of the waste managed was sent to recovery, 27% of the waste managed underwent water treatment, 13% of the waste managed underwent oil emulsion treatment and 12% of the waste managed was sent to other destinations, (ii) within our Regeneration business unit, 66%, 14%, 8% and 7% of lubricant oils processed were used to produce lubricant bases, bitumen additives, water and gas oil, respectively, while we outsourced 4% and 1% of lubricant oils processed for disposal and recovery, respectively, and (iii) within our Purification business unit, 60%, 25% and 10% of industrial streams and virgin raw materials processed were used to produce SFW, pure solvents from virgin raw materials and purified water, respectively, while we outsourced 4% and 1% of the materials processed for disposal and recovery, respectively. The remaining portion of the waste is delivered to third-party landfill sites and incinerators. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 72% of waste collected was internally treated (including waste oil for our Regeneration business unit), 13% was internally pre-treated and 16% was collected for sorting and storage. Our Regeneration business solutions enable us to reduce the impact on the environment compared to primary production, resulting in a reduction of approximately 90% in the consumption of fossil fuel resources, an approximately 200% reduction in CO2 emissions, an approximately 400% reduction in emissions of fine dusts and an approximately 500% reduction in the emission of acidifying substances (NOx, SO2 and NH3), in each case as compared to primary production. Furthermore, our Purification business solutions significantly reduce the impact of solvent recycling compared to primary production, resulting in an approximately 1,000% reduction in CO2 emissions. In addition, our integrated platform enables us to benefit from solid and attractive market dynamics, leveraging upon the ongoing regulatory shift from a “linear economy” in favor of a “circular economy.” We benefit from favorable regulation within the EU and Italy on waste treatment and used oil regeneration. Further to the enactment of EU Directive 2008/98/EC (supplemented by EU Directive 2018/850), the EU required member states to significantly reduce waste disposal in favor of recycling, by establishing a specific waste management hierarchy. Italy implemented the EU-prescribed waste hierarchy through national legislation and set up a system of recycling authorizations, imposing stringent restrictions on authorized production capacity for special waste that has reinforced our market position by creating high 4 ----- entry barriers. In addition, these stringent regulatory requirements are enablers of our strong market position as waste producers are incentivized to rely on our advanced recycling and waste management solutions as a way of managing high compliance and regulatory costs relating to the disposal and treatment of industrial waste, including risks of economic penalties and criminal sanctions. The graphic below presents our advantageous position across the waste management hierarchy. Furthermore, our Regeneration business benefits from the favorable regulatory framework established in Italy, one of the most virtuous countries in Europe in terms of collection and regeneration of used oil, where regenerated lubricant oil accounted for 99% of collected volumes in Italy in 2019, compared to an average of 51% in the EU over the same period. We benefit from incentive mechanisms established by CONOU (Consorzio nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e trattamento degli oli minerali usati), a private Italian consortium, to support our Regeneration business. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lubricant oil market price and vice versa, although in no event, such as instances of high lubricant oil market prices, does the incentive mechanism require us to pay a regeneration treatment fee to CONOU), ensures that we have downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lubricant oil prices and supports a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products, under normal circumstances. This framework has been in place for over ten years and has also been subject to modifications favorable for oil regeneration companies over the years to better reflect market dynamics and support collection and regeneration activities. In particular, based on the latest amendment in October 2020, the regeneration treatment fee is no longer subject to a set cap that historically limited the amount of compensation granted to oil regeneration companies during periods of significantly low oil prices, such as in the first halves of 2016 and 2020; therefore supporting a profitability floor even in significantly unfavorable oil price scenarios. We expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after December 2024, except in exceptional circumstances indicated in the CONOU Operating Regulation which, in any event, cannot be retroactive. We estimate that the removal of the set cap as well as other amendments to the formula, on a pro forma basis for the year 2020, would have had an estimated positive impact of €1.9 million on our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020. The quality and breadth of our role as a circular economy player enabled us to achieve a strong market position in Italy, where we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of hazardous waste through our Environment business unit for the year ended December 31, 2019. Given the highly fragmented nature of the hazardous waste management market in Italy, we were the second largest company by volume over the same period, with the leading company accounting for approximately 7% of the total volume of hazardous waste. In addition, we are the number one player in the Italian oil regeneration space, with an 5 ----- approximately 89% market share as of December 31, 2019, and a market leader in Europe in terms of oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output in 2019. We are also the leading company in the Italian waste solvent purification space, with a 50% market share by revenue, and the largest European player by capacity in 2019, with an approximately 37% share of the Italian market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,837 ktons,9.3.2,"Leadership position in defensive and profitable markets, benefiting from high entry barriers","We operate in markets characterized by high barriers to entry. The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits from higher barriers to entry compared to industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste due to strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical skills required for the waste management processes. Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has shown profitability and resiliency during periods of economic difficulties, recording a CAGR of approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014, compared to a negative CAGR of 2.2% and a CAGR of 0.2% during the same period for the Italian urban waste market and non-hazardous waste market, respectively, and a negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP over the same period. The resilience of our business in a challenging macro-economic environment was also displayed by our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 when despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue remained relatively flat as compared to 2019, on a like-for-like basis. Leveraging upon our strong and strategic local presence, especially in the most industrialized areas of Italy, we believe that our Environment business unit is advantageously positioned as a one-stop shop for producers of hazardous waste, alongside our Regeneration and Purification business units. We believe that our longstanding experience with hazardous waste, highly skilled staff and advanced waste management plants give us a strong competitive advantage over national competitors. In addition, the complexity of the authorization, certification, compliance and operational requirements in the waste management industry (especially with regard to the hazardous waste market), along with our geographical proximity to customers, also serve as natural barriers to entry. Through our Regeneration business unit, we hold a market leading position in Italy. We held approximately 89% of the market share of the Italian oil regeneration market by volume in 2019, and we are a leading company in Europe in terms of oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output in 2019. We believe that our economies of scale, proprietary technologies and contracted waste streams, also in light of the CONOU framework, provide us with a strong competitive advantage. Furthermore, the Italian used oil regeneration market requires significant upfront investment and is also characterized by complex authorization, certification and operational requirements, which serve as additional barriers to entry. Our Purification business has the largest installed capacity in the European waste solvent purification industry, at approximately 100 thousand tons per year, and we held 50% of the market share of the Italian waste solvent purification market by revenue in 2019. Reinforced by our circular partnership and established relationships with leading players in the pharmaceutical sector, we have also built strong positions in international end-markets, including leading positions in the waste-based thinner segments in Africa and the Middle East (with a market share of 38% and 37% by volumes, respectively, in 2019) and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe (with a 34% market share in 2019). We believe that our economies of scale, know-how, proprietary technologies and long-term partnerships with a loyal customer base have enabled our Purification business unit to secure and maintain market leading positions in Italy and Europe. In addition, the Italian solvent purification market is characterized by high barriers to entry, underpinned by requirements for significant upfront investment and the complexity of the authorization, certification, compliance and operational processes. We believe our competitors’ limited ability to replicate our business model also resides in our advanced R&D capabilities across our business units. Over the years, we have internalized value-adding processes, and developed products and waste treatment methods in partnership with our customers. This has created an intangible barrier, which does not solely rely on commercial relationships, but on years of expertise matured in close collaboration with our customers (such as, for example, our collaboration with API producers for the joint development of formulas for waste optimization in our Purification business unit). Furthermore, our ability to produce high-purity aliphatic solvents from virgin materials, combined with our 6 ----- trading activities relating to these products, allows us to establish increasingly solid and synergistic relationships with our customers and present our Purification business unit as a one-stop shop for highpurity aliphatic solvents. Our Purification business unit benefits from an authorized capacity for the production of non-waste finished products, such as virgin materials, of additional 100 thousand tons per year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Our strong geographical footprint and the density of our operational network in Northern Italy, especially in the Northern regions of Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna, allow us to benefit from economies of scale in managing complex logistics and the input sourcing reach of our production. These factors also improve our efficiency by minimizing the logistical burden and costs of transporting our raw materials to our facilities. In addition, our wide-reaching asset base enables geographical proximity to our customer base and ensures extensive coverage of the Italian market. Set forth below is a chart representing the location of our waste management sites as of June 30, 2021. We also operate two stand-alone laboratories for chemical and environmental analysis. Supported by a network of 18 waste management companies, our Environment business has an overall authorized capacity of approximately 900 thousand tons per year. Approximately 559 thousand tons of waste were processed through the waste storage and treatment plants of our Environment business unit for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, while additional 338 thousand tons were sold through the trading activities of our Environment business unit during the same period. Underpinned by over 50 years of experience in the production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process, our Regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano have a combined treatment capacity of 214 thousand tons per year. Approximately 184 thousand tons of used oil were processed through our oil regeneration plants for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our Purification business unit comprises two plants for purification and blending of solvents with an authorized capacity of 99 thousand tons per year for solvent and chemical purification deriving from waste, 100 thousand tons per year for solvent purification (e.g., for virgin materials) and chemical synthesis and 75 thousand tons per year for our blending plant in Rho, near Milan.

The solid relationships with our clients, their end-market diversification, along with the pricing stability levers inherent in our business, have allowed us to build a resilient business model with high visibility over revenue and profitability performance and operating cash generation. Anticipated structural growth in our end-markets (with an estimated CAGR of approximately 7% in the Italian hazardous waste market over the period 2021-2025), supported by structural imbalance between demand and supply, high switching costs for our customers and our entrenched presence in the most densely industrialized regions of Italy, are expected to generate premium economics in our business units. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), provides our Regeneration segment with downside protection against periods of low prices of crude oil and lubricant oil and supports a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products. The chart below shows the resilience of our Regeneration business unit despite fluctuations of oil prices over the period 2018-2020. Since 2018, we have achieved revenue and profitability growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions.

In September 2021, we adopted a sustainability-linked bond framework (the “Sustainability-Linked Bond",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,"Framework”). We identified the following key performance targets, in each case calculated as set forth in",9.8.1,,"our Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework: - a 25% increase in gross CO2 avoided emissions for the year ending December 31, 2025, compared to the baseline of 430,449.6 tons of CO2 for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target”). We believe the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target provides helpful insight on the impact of our activities on CO2 emission, and is calculated as the CO2 emissions avoided through our regenerated and purified products in substitution of virgin ones. Our regenerated and purified products contribute to avoiding emissions, limiting the increase of global emissions and substituting primary fossil material ones. The baseline of 430,449.6 tons of CO2 (the “CO2 Baseline”) has been calculated by the Itelyum Group in good faith but has not been independently verified or audited by any third party; and 12 ----- - a 25% increase in the quantity of waste collected and delivered to circular treatment for the year ending December 31, 2025, compared to the baseline of 574,184 tons of waste for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target” and, together with the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target, the “Sustainability Performance Targets”). We believe the Quantity of Waste for Circular Treatments Target provides helpful insight on the impact of our activities on the circular economy, and is calculated as the quantity of waste collected and delivered to circular treatments measured in tons per year as set forth in our Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework. Circular treatments include regeneration, recycling, waste water treatment and recovery. The baseline of 574,184 tons of waste (the “Circular Treatment Baseline”) has been calculated by the Itelyum Group in good faith and has been independently verified by a third party. In this Offering Memorandum, we refer to the Gross CO2 Avoided Emissions Target and the Circular Treatment Baseline, collectively, as the “SLB Baselines.” In the event the Issuer redeems the Notes pursuant to (i) the second or fifth paragraph of “Description of _Notes—Optional Redemption” at any time on or after June 30, 2022, and/or (ii) “Description of Notes— Redemption at Maturity,” and, in each case, unless the Group has met both of the Sustainability_ Performance Targets on the relevant testing date, as certified by the Issuer to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) in an officer’s certificate, which shall also include an Assurance Letter, on or prior to the relevant Certification Date, the applicable Step-up Premium will be payable in connection with the applicable redemption. For further information on the Step-Up Premium mechanics, see “Description of _Notes—Sustainability Performance Targets Step-up Redemption Premium.”_ We intend to report annually on our performance with respect to Sustainability Performance Target for the preceding calendar year. This report will be separate from, and in addition to, the reporting required under the Indenture for the Notes. Our Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework can be found on our website at http://www.itelyum.com.

The purchase price so calculated will be adjusted in the event the Target or any direct or indirect parent entity of the Target pays or effects certain dividend or distribution in cash in favor of the Sellers (collectively, the “Leakages”). As a result, the ultimate consideration under the Acquisition Agreement will in part be dependent on the timing of the Completion Date. It is expected that part of the consideration payable to certain management Co-Investor Sellers will be reinvested by the Co-Investor Sellers as equity interests in the Itelyum Group pursuant to the terms of the relevant Management Agreements (as defined below). On September 3, 2021, we received a declaration that the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement do not fall within the scope of the Italian Golden Power Legislation, from the Italian Presidency of the Council of Ministries (Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri).

The Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the same entities that guarantee the Notes and will be secured on a firstpriority basis over the same Collateral securing the Notes and certain hedging obligations (if any), subject to the applicable contractual and legal limitations. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to such hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility _Agreement.”_ (5) On or about the Completion Date, the proceeds under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes will be used by the Issuer to make the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan for an estimated aggregate principal amount of €82.3 million and the proceeds under Tranche C (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) of the Notes will be used by the Issuer to make the Itelyum Purification Proceeds Loan for an estimated aggregate principal amount of €68.1 million, as further described under “—The _Transactions—The Financing.” The proceeds from the Itelyum Proceeds Loans, together with cash on balance sheet of the_ Target Group, will be used for the completion of the Refinancing as described under “—The Transactions—The Refinancing” _and “Use of Proceeds.” The amount of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans is estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum_ and may change depending on several factors, including the timing of the Completion Date. (6) On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain significant limitations under Italian law, the Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, no later than 90 days from the earlier of (i) the Post-Completion Merger and (ii) in the event the Post Completion Merger does not occur, the date falling fifteen months after the Completion Date (the “Cut-Off Date”), certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) guarantee the Notes. Pursuant to the Indenture and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility or certain other indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor (as defined below), that is a subsidiary of the Issuer, shall enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor. For purposes of this Offering Memorandum, the term “Guarantors” shall refer to any subsidiary of the Issuer that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture on or after the Completion Date and the term “Guarantees” shall refer to the guarantees of the Notes by the Guarantors. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the subsidiaries of the Target that are expected to guarantee the Notes are Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification accounted for 64.3% of the Target Group’s revenue, 64.9% of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and, as of June 30, 2021, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification owned 75.6% of the Target Group’s total assets (net of intercompany balances). Prior to the granting of the Guarantees by the Guarantors, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Target and its subsidiaries). The Guarantees will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.” The Guarantees will be_ subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and may be subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description _of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”_ (7) Although Holdco is outside the “Restricted Group,” it will be subject to certain limited covenants under the Indenture as a thirdparty security provider. For further information, see “Description of Notes.” (8) Not all of the subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. As of June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s (or MergerCo’s, as applicable) subsidiaries which are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had €9.7 million in outstanding financial debt (excluding liabilities under recourse factoring of €11.6 million and excluding debt owed by Castiglia), of which €2.8 million was secured over assets other than the Collateral, which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those subsidiaries and minority stockholders of such subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries 19 ----- over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors), preferred stockholders (if any) and minority stockholders of such non-guarantor subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the _Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of all of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.”_ 20 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

If withholding or deduction for any such taxes imposed by a relevant taxing jurisdiction is required to be made with respect to a payment under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received after the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that would have been received in the absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description _of_ _Notes— _Withholding Taxes.”_ The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy and therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations. Subject to and as set forth in “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer will not be liable to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes if any withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Decree No. 239 or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (“Decree No. 461”), except, in the case of Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, where the procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not been 28 ----- complied with due solely to the actions or omissions of the Issuer or their agents. See “Description of Notes—Withholding _Taxes.” Although we believe that, under current law, Italian_ withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a holder of the Notes is resident for tax purposes in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (as identified currently in Ministerial Decree of September 4, 1996 as subsequently amended and supplemented and, in the future, in any decree to be issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239; any such decree, the “White List”) and such holder of the Notes complies with certain certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case.

Pursuant to the Indenture and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility or certain other indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor (as defined below) that is a subsidiary of the Issuer, shall enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor. For purposes of this Offering Memorandum, the term “Guarantors” shall refer to any subsidiary of the Issuer that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture after the Completion Date and the term “Guarantees” shall refer to the guarantees of the Notes by the Guarantors. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the subsidiaries of the Target that are expected to guarantee the Notes are Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification accounted for 64.3% of the Target Group’s revenue, 64.9% of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and 75.6% of the Target Group’s total assets (net of intercompany balances). Prior to the granting of the Guarantees by the Guarantors, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including the Target and its subsidiaries) The Guarantees will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees _and_ _the_ _Collateral_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law Considerations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.” The_ Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor 22 ----- Agreement and may be subject to release under certain circumstances.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact) provide useful information with respect to our overall operating performance and debt service capacity by facilitating comparisons of operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items not directly resulting from core operations. Adjusted EBITDA is the main measure management uses to assess the trading performance of our business and, therefore, we believe it may be helpful to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the trading performance of our business.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We may face liabilities in connection with environmental matters.” (c) Represents the impact of the exclusion of finance lease costs had the IAS 17 accounting principle been applied for all our leases relating to industrial equipment for the periods presented. Under Italian GAAP, lease payments are accounted for as non-recurring costs. Therefore, we have made this adjustment to normalize our industrial-related costs, net of the impact of non-recurring lease costs that will be nil upon lease redemption. (d) For each relevant period, the adjustment relates to costs primarily associated with mergers of subsidiaries as a result of internal reorganizations and the acquisitions we made in such period, including in respect of legal and advisory services and the rebranding initiatives.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period divided by pro forma revenue. Pro forma revenue represents our revenue for the relevant period, adjusted to give pro formaf effect to the acquisitions of the Acquired Companies as if each of the Acquired Companies had been acquired on January 1, 2018, instead of their actual respective acquisition dates, and has been derived from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data set forth under “—Unaudited Pro forma _Financial Data” below.

Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance_ with, Italian GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles. The pro forma adjustment relating to the impact of the acquisition of Castiglia used to calculate Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on the information available to us in connection with the acquisition of Castiglia, together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. Such adjustment is inherently uncertain and subject to a wide variety of significant uncertainties. Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur to, among other things, integrate Castiglia into the Target Group or any potential synergies or other impacts related to or expected to 37 ----- derive from the acquisition of Castiglia, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of Castiglia would have been for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, if we had acquired Castiglia on July 1, 2020. We believe that Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful indication of what our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, would have been under the circumstances and assumptions described herein. However, this measure is not a measurement of our financial performance under Italian GAAP or other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered a substitute measure to operating result, operating cash flows or any other measures of performance or our liquidity.

The EBITDA of Castiglia for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 is based on the annual financial statements of Castiglia for the year ended December 31, 2020 and management accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021. (2) Represents Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro forma revenue. Pro forma revenue for the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021 represents our revenue for such period, adjusted to give pro forma effect to the acquisitions of the Acquired Companies as if each of the Acquired Companies had been acquired on January 1, 2018, instead of their actual respective acquisition dates, which has been derived from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data (representing an amount of €411.1 million), plus an amount of €30.5 million corresponding to the expected revenue, based on our management’s internal estimate, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, of Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021. See “Summary—Recent _Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.” We are reflecting these perimeter adjustments in our pro forma revenue for the_ calculation of Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin in light of the fact that our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA also takes into account these perimeter adjustments.

We are also including leases in the calculation of Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt, which inclusion is not consistent with Italian GAAP, because Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are similarly adjusted to add-back all lease related expense. Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt does not include (i) liabilities under recourse factoring for an amount of €11.6 million as of June 30, 2021, (ii) approximately €8.0 million we expect to budget as provision for environmental liabilities on our balance sheet as a result of the Lauro Settlement Agreement and (iii) €12.1 million of deferred purchase consideration for acquisitions previously completed, of which €5.8 million relates to the acquisition of Castiglia, acquired on July 2, 2021, and is expected to be paid in January 2023, all of which we expect to remain outstanding following the Transactions. For the purposes of this calculation, we have taken into account an estimated amount of pro forma cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets of €30.7 million, which reflects our cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets as of June 30, 2021 (€66.2 million), adjusted for €27.8 million of cash of the Target Group which we expect to use to complete the Transactions (as described under “Use of Proceeds”), the partial payment of the purchase price of €13.6 million in respect of the acquisition of equity interests in Castiglia paid on July 2, 2021 and the estimated amount of cash and cash equivalents of €5.9 million held by Castiglia as of June 30, 2021, as further described in footnote (1) under “Capitalization.” See also “—Recent Developments—Settlement Agreements Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities” and “—Recent _Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.” Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt has not been prepared in accordance with_ Italian GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our net total financial debt would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our net total financial debt for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"Our business and results of operations are impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions and economic downturns, particularly in Italy.","Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, especially in Italy where we generated approximately 78.9% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, can weaken the primary driver of our customers’ businesses and, in turn, weaken all segments of our business (Environment, Regeneration and Purification). In a recessionary environment, a reduction in activity levels from our customers, including as a result of plant closures, may result in decreasing waste volumes we process and decreasing demand for the products obtained through our waste treatment processes, such as base oil, gas oil and other by-products. In Italy, after a period of steady growth resulting in a CAGR of approximately 12% over the years 2014-2019, the volume of hazardous waste recycling activities is estimated to record a decrease in CAGR of approximately 2% over the period 20192021, primarily as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, our production volume of base oil, gas oil and bitumen in our Regeneration business decreased by approximately 17%, 17% and 32%, respectively, compared to 2019, primarily driven by a decrease in collected volumes and reduced demand. Volatility and decrease in demand for oil-based products can also have a correspondingly negative impact on the price at which we sell our products and, as a result, our operating income and cash flows. In addition, commodity prices for raw materials, such as oil or aliphatics, fluctuate according to global economic supply and demand, especially levels of worldwide economic growth. For example, the selling prices of aliphatics, which are produced through our Purification activities, are based on the market price of virgin naphtha, which decreased by 22.7% over the period 2018-2020. It can be difficult to predict such macroeconomic trends, which can have a significant impact on the demand for both our waste services and on the sales of our products. While the waste management sector is one of the industrial segments that has historically been less affected by global financial crises and economic slowdown, the recessionary conditions and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, especially in Italy, may adversely impact our customers and thus our waste management activities. In addition, governmental measures (including lockdowns and confinements) implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in 2020 also had a negative impact on the sale of products. Furthermore, our business model involves high fixed costs related to our network of waste management sites, the associated equipment and personnel. In the event of a sustained economic downturn in Italy, particularly in the Northern regions where the majority of our plants are located, we may experience difficulty in adjusting our operations in response to the shifting volumes of waste being treated. Such an event may cause some of our waste management sites to become idle or operate at lower than peak capacity, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. In addition, as result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our sites have in the past and may in the future have to suspend operations or operate at reduced capacity due to nationwide governmental measures (including lockdowns and confinements) that may be implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. See “—The impact of COVID-19 _and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.”_ Political conditions in Italy could also negatively impact our business. In September 2019, a coalition government composed of the center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement was 41 ----- sworn in. Such coalition government was formed on the back of the 2018 general election, in which no party won an outright majority, resulting in a hung parliament and leading to protracted negotiations to form a new government. These negotiations were concluded with the formation of a coalition government, composed of the League and Five Star Movement parties, which then collapsed in August 2019. Following the recent Italian government crisis, a new technocratic government was formed in February 2021. It is unclear how long the current government will remain in office and whether it will be able to adequately address impediments to the country’s growth, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP, the write-down of non-performing loans and the reduction of unemployment in Italy. Continuation or further worsening of these economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The resulting disease, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures, we transitioned a portion of our workforce to remote working and experienced operational difficulties. Our plants in Pieve Fissiraga e di Ceccano were closed for several weeks between April and June 2020 resulting in a decrease of our volume of waste oil processed of approximately 68% compared to the corresponding period of 2019. Furthermore, the collection, transportation and storage activities of our Environment business unit experienced a slowdown between March and June 2020. Additionally, even though the nationwide quarantine in Italy was lifted on May 4, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall Italian economy and, in turn, our operations and our customers’ operations. In particular, as the number of infections in Italy significantly increased in the fall of 2020, new drastic measures were taken, including a nationwide evening curfew and certain more stringent ad hoc measures for regions with higher infection rates, which has resulted in, among other things, protests and further economic and social turmoil. Between the end of 2020 and early 2021, restrictive measures continued to be implemented, in many instances with the imposition of localized lockdowns across Italy along with the nationwide evening curfew. Additional quarantine measures implemented in March 2021 have further restricted interregional travel across the country, causing further disruption to business activities. Our Regeneration business was particularly impacted by the decline in collected oil and production slowdown in the first half of 2020 as a result of the lockdown measures implemented by the Italian government, resulting in a decrease in our production volumes of base oil, gas oil and bitumen. Revenue and EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 from our Regeneration business unit decreased by 12.8% and 33.2%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the financial and social difficulties generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we could also lose customers as a result of bankruptcy or other financial difficulties, or customers could otherwise become insolvent and be unable to continue to pay for our products and services, which could harm our liquidity. Furthermore, the activities of our agents and sales representatives are and may continue to be limited by the restrictions imposed by the Italian government or other authorities to address the risk of transmission of COVID-19, which may result in the loss of existing or potential customers and the slowdown of our future growth rates compared to the past. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union institutions, the Italian government and governments of other member states of the European Union to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects depends on several factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and further restrictive actions taken by the Italian government in response to new strains of the virus, any additional periods of lockdown in Italy, and the pace at which demand, pricing and, in general, economic and 42 ----- operating conditions will stabilize and recover in Italy. Any future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening any or all of the other risks described in this “Risk _Factors” section._",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

We compete with a large number of small local companies specialized in selected aspects of the waste management process, including Marazzato, Vidori and Venanzieffe. These local family-owned companies comprise the majority of the Italian market. In addition, we face competition from waste management branches of established national multiutility companies, such as A2A Ambiente, Iren and HERAmbiente. Furthermore, we compete against structured private groups, such as Ecoeridania, Riccoboni, Ambienthesis and Mecomer. If we are unable to defend our market position by offering competitive services or reducing our cost bases, the price pressure exerted by these competitors could cause us to lose important customers. In addition, existing market participants and new entrants may seek to gain increased market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies. Where competitors seek to gain or retain market share through strong discounting or similar competitive business practices, we may be required to lower our prices and rates to avoid the loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting our operating results. In addition, if we are unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as our competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, we could lose market share to our competitors. Furthermore, we may suffer from the rise of alternative techniques in collection and treatment of waste materials in our industry. Although technologically viable alternatives are currently not readily available, they may be developed in the future. If these alternatives become more cost effective or more easily accessible, they may diminish our market share and reduce our revenues. See “—If we are unable to keep pace with technological, _regulatory and market developments, we may not be able to compete as effectively as our competitors and our business could be adversely affected.”_ In addition, a number of our competitors may consolidate or form alliances with each other in the future, either internationally or with local waste management companies. The successful consolidation of two or more of our competitors could result in the combination of their resources and technological capabilities, improved access to a wider customer base, increased investment capacity and improved economies of scale. This could lead to intensified competition in our markets and a loss of market share for us. If we are unable to compete effectively against such consolidated companies or alliances, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

We currently have, or in the foreseeable future anticipate commencing and expanding, operations in a number of emerging markets, including several countries in Middle East and Africa, which may expose us to certain risks to a greater extent than in connection with our operations in more-developed markets. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue generated from emerging markets accounted for approximately 9% of our revenue for the period. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including impositions of tariffs or embargoes, export controls, trade barriers and trade disputes, regulations related to customs and export/import matters, fluctuations in foreign economies and currency exchange rates, longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives, consultants and distributors, tax uncertainties and unanticipated tax costs due to foreign taxing regimes, the difficulty of managing and operating an enterprise spanning several countries, the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights and differing legal systems generally, compliance with a variety of laws and regulations, and economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, armed conflicts, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships, and military and political alliances. 43 ----- Any of these factors could adversely affect the success and profitability of our operations in those countries. Moreover, developments in certain emerging markets often affect other emerging markets and, accordingly, adverse changes in emerging markets elsewhere in the world could have a negative impact on the markets in which we operate or intend to operate in the foreseeable future.

Moreover, stringent and evolving regulations apply to the machinery and equipment that we use to operate our business. Environmental regulations have changed rapidly in recent years, and it is possible that we will be subject to even more stringent environmental standards in the future. The regulatory framework governing our operations imposes significant compliance burdens on us and requires us to obtain permits and operational and environmental authorizations. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, a permit or authorization, the non-renewal of or a challenge to a permit or authorization, or the imposition of more stringent conditions associated with the permits and authorizations we are required to obtain, could result in substantial fines, claims relating to violations of environmental laws or regulations or the revocation or suspension of certain authorizations, concessions and/or licenses and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may also incur significant costs and other expenditures with respect to our waste management sites to comply with our obligations under various environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations, as well as in sanitary risk management, in particular with respect to water discharges, waste processing, soil and ground water contamination and GHG emissions. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the protection of human health and the environment, including laws and regulations concerning employee health and safety. We can give no assurance, however, that we will continue to be in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including as a consequence of new thresholds and standards introduced by amendments to the applicable legislation. Any future violation of such laws and regulations could require us to pay fines and damages, result in the closure of one of our waste management sites, damage our reputation or impede our ability to continue to conduct our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. While we have adopted EHS policies and procedures in order to minimize such risks, a failure in such policies and procedures may occur. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability including monetary fines or compensation to third parties or other sanctions. Any failure to comply with our internal EHS policies and/or to comply with health and safety practices or environmental risk management procedures in general that results in serious or fatal harm to employees, subcontractors, the public or the environment could also expose us to investigations and administrative sanctions, prosecutions criminal or civil litigation, each of which could determine an increase in costs for fines, settlements and management time.

Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities and are frequently issued subject to conditions requiring the implementation of improvement works at the relevant sites. Typically, our permits require continuous compliance with certain conditions in order to maintain the permit. Our permits may require us to adhere to evolving compliance requirements and environmental standards, which could result in significant additional costs or environmental obligations for us. In addition, we expect the waste volume processed in our facilities to increase over the next few years, including through the continued development of centers of excellence in waste management in order to capture market growth, investments in special projects aiming at expanding our production capacity and expanding the type of services we provide at certain of our waste management sites. Our waste management sites require a variety of permits related to environmental, building permit, fire prevention, seismic and zoning laws that typically cover a period from eight to 16 years, which we may not be able to renew for existing sites or obtain for new sites or existing sites currently offering fewer services. The permit application process in Italy from the submission of the application to the receipt of the final authorization to operate the relevant site can be lengthy, as decisions may be subject to review, legal or other challenge or delay. Obtaining the required permits and approvals to expand capacity at existing sites or build new facilities has become increasingly burdensome and expensive, requiring numerous hearings and compliance with various building permit, fire prevention, seismic, zoning, environmental and regulatory laws in general and drawing resistance from citizens and environmental or other groups. We cannot guarantee that we will receive such authorizations within an expected time frame or at all and be able to open additional sites or expand capacity at existing facilities in the future. Despite material compliance of our facilities with regulatory requirements, we occasionally face opposition relating to the operation of such facilities by local communities who do not want a waste management facility in their vicinity on public nuisance or other grounds. Local communities or other stakeholders may challenge our permits or authorizations before the competent administrative court, which could significantly slow or interrupt operations or development of new waste management facilities. Increased opposition from local communities may also make it increasingly difficult for us to find locations for new facilities or expand existing facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our operations.

Our Regeneration business is primarily carried out through two facilities located in Northern and Central Italy, while our Purification business is principally carried out at a solvent purification facility and a solvent blending and filling facility, each located in Northern Italy. The occurrence of disruptive events at our facilities could significantly disrupt or severely curtail our operations, especially in relation to our Regeneration and Purification activities which are conducted through a limited number of facilities. These events could also result in reduction in efficiency for our operations, lost revenue during the period of disruption and/or costly remediation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that any such events put our employees in danger, we may also be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, and suffer reputational damages. 45 ----- In addition, because of the nature of the industrial activities conducted at our waste management sites, there exists a risk of injury or death to our employees and others in the course of our and our customers’ operations, notwithstanding the safety precautions we take, such as in relation to exposure to chemical substances or artificial optical radiation. Violations of, or liabilities under, applicable EHS laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, legal claims as well as increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition. In the event of an industrial accident, we may be faced with an interruption in service and claims for damages, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend, in addition to being exposed to potential reputational damage, which could result in the loss of customers. Should we be found to be negligent, or the cover provided through insurance prove to be insufficient or the specific risk found to be not covered by insurance, the corresponding shortfall in or lack of insurance could mean that we are liable for the injury suffered. Under applicable Italian law, in cases where workers become injured in connection with their employment duties and as a result are absent from work for more than 40 days, the relevant public prosecutor must open an investigation into workplace safety and, depending on the circumstances, may bring criminal proceedings against our regional officer charged with workplace safety or against our management or chief executive officer. Any conviction for failures or omissions related to workplace safety may violate a morality clause in relevant public tenders, expose us to liabilities under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See “—Potential liabilities, costs and reputational impacts from litigation and other proceedings _could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”_ We are also subject to risks related to an outbreak of a disease, such as COVID-19, in one of our storage sites, or at one of our suppliers’ facilities, or at those of our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our operations by requiring us to reduce the number of employees on site to comply with social distancing requirements, invest in protective and other safety equipment and accelerate the deployment of automated machinery. The outbreak of a disease in one of our sites may limit our ability to operate our business.

In the European Union, these types of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue. In particular, in the European Union, certain of the waste produced through our Regeneration business and certain of the Purification products and raw materials produced in, exported from or imported into and/or sold in, the European Union are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. The European Union Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006) (“REACH”) (as amended and updated from time to time), imposes significant obligations on the chemicals industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of building block and semi-specialty chemicals. REACH is reviewed annually and, as a result, new regulations that further impact our businesses and operations may be proposed and implemented in the future. In addition, the regulation on classification, labelling and packaging (Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008) (“CLP”), imposes further obligations in relation to the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals that are treated by our Purification business unit. In connection with the REACH regulation, certain of the waste treated as part of our Regeneration business could be classified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, on users of our products or on our employees. As part of our compliance with the REACH regulation, we are required demonstrate that the risks to human health or the environment associated with uses of these substances are adequately controlled by carrying out periodic testing of their toxicological level. These regulations could significantly impact our cost of operating our Regeneration and Purification business units, and we may incur significant costs and other expenditures to maintain continuous compliance with such laws and regulations. As a result, our failure to maintain compliance with the abovementioned chemical safety standards and regulations could result in a breach of law and could in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 46 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

We may also be liable for the damages caused to human health by the presence of hazardous materials (including asbestos and other potentially carcinogenic substances) at the premises owned or operated by us, as well as for any on-site environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances whose transportation or treatment we or companies we acquired arranged or conducted and we may also be liable for any environmental damage (such as contamination) caused by former owner(s) of the sites that we currently own and/or operate. Those costs or actions could be significant to us and impact our results of operations, cash flows and available capital. From January 2018 to December 2020, we carried out a number of remediation projects, primarily in relation to our oil regeneration plants and solvent purification plants, for which we incurred approximately €4.0 million of costs, primarily for environmental analysis and remediation activities. As of June 30, 2021, we had made provisions of €6.4 million for potential environmental liabilities and ecological clean-ups. In addition, pursuant to the Lauro Settlement Agreement, which we entered into on August 9, 2021, we undertook to bear the costs of certain environmental remediation activities relating to the Landriano purification site, estimated to be approximately €8.0 million as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Such amount is expected to be budgeted as provision for environmental liabilities on our balance sheet. We expect to incur these costs over the period 2021-2030. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Settlement Agreements Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities.” We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for our environmental liabilities, such coverage may not cover all of the potential liabilities to which we may be subject and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at reasonable expense or at all. It is also possible that government officials responsible for enforcing environmental laws may believe an issue is more serious than we expect, or that we will fail to identify or fully appreciate an existing liability before we become legally responsible for addressing it (including the case where such officials identify us as responsible for certain contaminations and environmental breaches in general in relation to which investigations and analysis are currently ongoing). Some of the legal sanctions to which we could become subject could cause the suspension or revocation of a required permit, prevent us from, or delay us in, obtaining or renewing permits to operate or expand our waste management sites, or harm our reputation. There can be no assurance that the cost of such cleanup or that our share of the cost will not exceed our estimates.

For example, some of our customers could begin to set up environmental policies to reuse certain of their products and reduce waste generally. Waste reduction programs may reduce the volume of waste available for processing in some areas where we operate. Though governmental authorities increasingly favor recycling over alternative waste disposal methods, we can provide no assurance that waste volumes will be available in sufficient quantities to keep our waste processing and recycling sites operating at sufficient capacity. Any significant change in regulation or patterns regarding disposal of waste could have a material adverse effect on our revenue by reducing the level of demand for our services. In addition, our business is also exposed to fluctuations in costs related to certain commodities, such as oil and electricity, which we extensively use for carrying out our operations and operating our equipment and vehicle fleet, or to changes in the applicable legal and regulatory framework. Prices for oil and electricity are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand, change in applicable laws and regulations, adverse weather and regional production patterns. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in passing on cost increases to customers without losses in revenue or gross profit margin.

We typically collect waste pursuant to contractual arrangements or orders, the majority of which are yearly contracts. Though we have historically had a high renewal rate for such contracts and have a long standing relationship with the majority of our customer base, the customers under such contracts may turn to our competitors, cease their operations, terminate their contracts with us, increase pricing pressure on us or cease to require our services due to changes in their business model. Our customer contracts for waste services generally contain provisions for termination and events of default that allow our respective customers to terminate their agreements with us for a number of reasons, some of which are outside of our control. Furthermore, certain of our contracts are awarded following a competitive bidding process. Such processes may be lengthy and we may be required to devote significant resources, both in terms of management time and finances, on bidding for contracts that we ultimately may not win. If, after the competitive tender process, we do not succeed in being awarded the contracts for new business or fail to renew existing contracts, our market share and revenue could materially decline, which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In the ordinary course of business, we actively seek to identify and pursue bolt-on acquisition opportunities that allow us to maximize territorial coverage and consolidate our leading positioning in our core verticals of Environment, Regeneration and Purification, or expand to new verticals. Between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021, we acquired controlling stakes in or the entire share capital of ten companies (excluding the transactions where we only increased our stake in previously acquired companies and companies that were already controlled by the acquired companies). We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisitions opportunities going forward or complete any particular acquisition, combination, joint venture or other transaction on acceptable terms. Acquisitions pose additional risks, including potential overpayment in relation to purchase price, incurrence of unexpected costs or the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed risks. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions may depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or otherwise raise substantial capital, and we may not have or be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Furthermore, such transactions could be significant or transformational in size and importance for the Itelyum Group and the consolidation of the results of such businesses may affect the comparability of our financial statements with prior periods. See “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on acquisitions.”_ 48 ----- In evaluating potential acquisitions, we make certain assumptions regarding the future combined results of the existing and acquired operations, the consolidation of operations and the improved operating cost structures for the combined operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably operate the acquired businesses and that the expected synergies or benefits will be achieved on the assumed time schedule or in the assumed amount, if at all. We cannot predict the timing and success of our efforts to acquire or combine with any particular business and fully integrate the acquired business into our existing organizational set-up, commercial channels and operating model. Moreover, we may in the future enter new geographies and seek to leverage our core expertise and know-how by penetrating new European markets, such as the industrial waste management, the oil regeneration or the pharmaceutical purification markets. Should we pursue this strategy, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to profitably operate in such new geographies or markets and to achieve the level of revenue, profitability and growth that we expect. If we acquire businesses outside of Italy, we would be exposed to, among other risks, increased regulatory risk, which could result in an increase of compliance related costs and increased risks of breaching laws and regulations which we may not be familiar with and the associated consequences. In addition, the integration of an acquired business and its systems, operations and personnel, particularly in respect of businesses operating in new and adjacent markets, could be more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, including as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted in response of such pandemic. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable also because of the complexity of waste treatment processes involved, and/or when the size of the acquired business is significant as compared to the size of the acquiror. Successful integration also requires coordination of different teams (e.g., engineers or R&D personnel). This integration can prove difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions or commercial approach and, more generally, organizational and operations set-up. Any of these factors could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key employees, suppliers, agents and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated synergies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Collection of receivables for customers of our Regeneration and Purification business units typically takes place within 60 days, while our Environment customers generally pay within 100 days of invoicing. Certain of our waste management customers and purchasers of our by-products may become insolvent or default under their contracts, or be or may become significantly late in performing under their payment obligations to us. As of June 30, 2021, we had €91.8 million in trade receivables and provisions for impairment of such receivables were 1% of our total balance, including €2.3 million relating to the delay in payment of a customer of our Purification business unit, which receivable arose prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. In 2020, we suffered from some other delays in payment from customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In case of a default in payment obligations, we may be unable to collect the related receivables, in which case some or all of such outstanding amounts would need to be written off and we would need to seek alternative sources of funding for our working capital requirements. In case of a delay in a customer’s payment obligation, we may be exposed to the risk of bearing in advance the costs and amounts necessary to provide our services to such customer. Should the Italian economy experience further economic volatility or tightening credit markets, the risk that we may not be able to collect payments on a timely basis from our customers could materially increase. Further, a deterioration of economic conditions in Italy, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by our customers. Accordingly, this could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as in a reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flow. See “—The _impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.”_ Finally, if we underestimate the amounts needed for our allowance for bad debts or if our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, we may not be able to meet our working capital or debt service requirements and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. 49 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

We believe that our innovations, technology, industrial know-how and the industrial design of our waste management facilities are key differentiating factors in a competitive marketplace, and consequently we devote a significant amount of our resources to developing and adopting best practices related to the implementation of industrial processes relevant to the services we provide as well as associated research and development. Our Regeneration business benefits from a patented proprietary process for the productions of lubricant bases, the Revivoil technology, which was developed in collaboration with the French company Axens and is now widely used by leading lubrication companies worldwide. We and other players in the industry are increasingly focusing on technology solutions that either provide alternatives to traditional waste management processes and/or improve value extraction from the waste management value chain. However, such research and investment activities may require substantial investments on our part and dedication and resources by our management and workforce and may not ultimately yield the tangible benefits to our business. If we are unable to successfully implement the new technologies that we develop or apply technologies that we purchase and/or license, we may not be able to recover the costs spent on their development or acquisition. If we fail to innovate or if a competitor develops or obtains exclusive rights to a breakthrough technology that provides a benefit over our waste services, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if we are unable to predict or adapt to emerging industry and market standards and other technological and regulatory changes, or fail to adopt other technologies offered by our competitors, our revenue and results of operations might be adversely affected.

CONOU is a private Italian_ consortium established in 1984 to promote and support waste oil collection and regeneration activities in Italy. Since 2010, CONOU has set up an incentive mechanism paid to oil regeneration companies, the CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lube oil (i.e. the fee increases upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), thus ensuring that Itelyum and other players in the Italian regeneration industry are granted certain downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lube oil prices. Lube oil producers fund the oil regeneration value chain by paying to CONOU a fee, as required by the current legal and regulatory framework, which during the last 10 years resulted in approximately €0.09 on average for each litre of lubricant oil sold in Italy. CONOU distributes the amounts so collected via, inter alia, the regeneration treatment fee. The regeneration treatment fee granted by CONOU thus sustains the circularity in all the phases of the waste oil economic cycle and permits us to significantly offset the cyclical decrease in oil prices by supporting a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products. See “Business— _CONOU Incentive Mechanisms.” For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our revenue from CONOU_ represented 34% of revenue from our Regeneration business unit for the period. Revenue from our Regeneration business unit accounted for 29.0% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. In addition, our Environmental business unit generated approximately 4% of revenue from services provided to CONOU for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. CONOU has recently amended the formula for determining the regeneration treatment fee, which came into force in October 2020. We expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after December 2024, except in exceptional circumstances indicated in the CONOU Operating Regulation which, in any event, cannot be retroactive. Any significant amendment to the formula and the current framework for incentive mechanics established by CONOU may have a material impact on the profitability of our Regeneration business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the Italian government may decide to adopt a different model for the collection and treatment of waste oil, including adopting a free market approach, which is already in place within several countries in the European Union, including Germany, France and Sweden, where regeneration industry players do not benefit from such favorable framework. The adoption of a different model may materially and adversely affect our profitability and 50 ----- would require us to make significant adjustments to our Regeneration operations and the methods we employ for waste collection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the majority of the waste oil processed in our Regeneration activities is supplied by the collection companies affiliated with CONOU pursuant to contractual agreements that we enter into with each collection company directly on a company-specific basis, with an average length of three years. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 18% of total volume of waste oil was supplied to us by collection companies affiliated with CONOU. Any deterioration of our relationship with CONOU, as well as any disruption or delay in the supply of waste oil by the collection companies could materially impact the volume of waste oil supplied to us, and we may be unable to source input products from other suppliers at the required volume, and/or at the same or lower prices, which could result in delays in our Regeneration business unit processes and an associated inability to provide our customers with the volumes required under our contractual arrangements with them or within the agreed timing.

Many companies are investigating ways to develop technologies to produce high quality fuel using renewable feedstocks. At the same time, vehicles powered by hybrid systems and electric motors are beginning to gain a significant market share. Even though lube oil consumption in Italy is envisaged to remain stable over the period 2021-2030, demand for gasoline and diesel fuel in road transport may experience a decrease due to consumers’ environmental concerns and the automanufacturers’ continuing rollout of new, highly efficient car models. A more rapid dissemination of new renewable fuel production technologies or new vehicles powered by advanced fuel efficiency or hybrid or electric engines may result in lower levels of oil fuel consumption and thus have an adverse effect on our Regeneration business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Our performance depends upon accurate, timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid day-to-day business and decision-making processes. The administration of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. In addition, we outsource the operation and maintenance of certain of our information technology systems to seek to ensure effective management of our information technology resources, as well as to improve the cost efficiency of our information technology infrastructure, systems and applications. We rely on the ability of our outsourcing partners to deliver agreed services. Their failure to perform satisfactorily could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Although we seek to protect confidential technical information and know-how, we still face the risk of undue disclosure to third parties due to circumstances beyond our control. We may experience from time to time 52 ----- cyber-threats, cyber-attacks and cyber-security breaches, which can include unauthorized attempts to access, disable, use, modify or degrade our information, systems and networks, and the data within, or the introduction of computer viruses and other malicious codes and fraudulent “phishing” e-mails that seek to misappropriate data and information, or install malware onto users’ computers. Cyber-threats and breaches vary in technique and sources, and are caused by criminal hackers, purveyors of financial fraud, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance or error, among others. These threats are persistent and increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect. A breach of cyber/data security measures that impairs our IT infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our waste management sites, access customer information and communicate with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Upon the completion of an acquisition, we seek to integrate our IT systems with those of the acquired company. Successful integration of information processes requires a number of factors including but not limited to experience and qualifications of information security specialists implementing the integration procedure, ability to ensure network controls and maintain confidentiality during network transmission and ability to design and implement a single, unified system. There is no assurance that there will not be any failure or delays in planned IT integration which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Any processing of personally identifiable information of individuals located in the European Economic Area in the course of the provision of services is governed by the European data protection laws and regulations, which restrict our ability to collect, process and use personally identifiable information relating to customers, potential customers, business partners, and employees, including for marketing purposes. Such laws and regulations concern the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer of personally identifiable information. In particular, starting from May 25, 2018, our operations are subject to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) and to the Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, as amended by Legislative Decree no. 101/2018, which adapted Italian rules to GDPR). The GDPR increased both the number and the restrictive nature of the obligations binding us in particular with respect to the collection, processing and use of personally identifiable information. The GDPR, inter alia, provides for significant applicable maximum fines, up to the higher of (i) €20 million or (ii) 4% of annual global turnover per breach, as opposed to fines of less than €1 million under the former regime; more onerous consent requirements, as consent will always have to be express/opt-in, while implied/opt-out consent has at times been deemed sufficient under the former regime; and stronger rights for individuals, including an individual “right to be forgotten,” which would require us to permanently delete a user’s personally identifiable information in certain circumstances. We adapted our internal procedures and operations to the requirements imposed by the GDPR and the Italian Privacy Code and have taken actions to ensure the constant and complete implementation of the best practices for compliance with the applicable data protection regulatory framework. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we carried out the GDPR and the Italian Privacy Code implementation effort in an appropriate effective and timely manner, and any related failure in complying with the applicable data protection and privacy regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Finally, the European Commission has proposed to replace Directive 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “E Privacy Directive”) with a new regulation primarily aimed at aligning certain provisions of the E Privacy Directive to the GDPR. The Proposal for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “E Privacy Regulation”) was published by the European Commission on January 10, 2017 and is currently under negotiation in light of the draft proposals issued by the European Parliament and the European Council. The draft E Privacy Regulation proposes heightened regulatory requirements in connection 53 ----- with unsolicited communications, the use of cookies, security of personally identifiable information, confidentiality of communications, consent, data security and data integrity. In line with the GDPR, breaches of the E Privacy Regulation may result in maximum fines equal to the greater of €20 million and 4% of the annual global turnover of the sanctioned company. The regulatory environment governing our use of data relating to identifiable individuals (customers, employees and others) is complex. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change frequently, and compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings, investigations or actions (including class actions) brought against us by governmental entities/agencies or private individuals/entities, significant fines, penalties, judgments and reputational damages to our business, requiring us to change business practices and increasing the costs and complexity of compliance, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Our primary exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is for the purchases of certain raw materials and sales of certain of our products in U.S. dollars. Foreign exchange exposure has typically been relevant to our Purification business unit, which recorded 13.8% of its revenue in U.S. dollars for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, corresponding to 5.0% of our revenue for the period. Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the euro-equivalent amount based on the exchange rate set on the transaction date, while the exchange differences realized at the date of collection or payment are recorded in the income statement as foreign exchange gains or losses.

Credit risk in these countries and in other Eurozone countries could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual euro member states. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and tensions in North Africa and Eastern Europe and other world events could adversely affect the economies of the European Union and those of other countries. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Commission and EU member states to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe, the overall stability of the Eurozone, the influx of refugees in certain European countries and the rise of populism in Europe. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. See “—The impact of COVID-19 _and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.”_ On March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom officially triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, signaling the start of a two-year period in which the United Kingdom would negotiate the terms of its exit (“Brexit”) from the European Union. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020, before which the United Kingdom and the European Commission reached an agreement on the future trading relationship between the parties (the “UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement” or “TCA”). On December 30, 2020, the UK Parliament approved the European Union (Future Relationship) Bill, thereby ratifying the TCA. The TCA was applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 to April 30, 2021 as it was subject to formal approval by the 54 ----- European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before it came into effect. On April 27, 2021 and April 29, 2021, respectively, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union formally approved the TCA, which entered into force permanently on May 1, 2021. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on the buying behavior of commercial and individual customers. The resulting political and economic uncertainty could also lead to further calls for other governments of other member states of the European Union to consider withdrawal from the European Union or the abandonment of the euro as a currency. Such developments, or the perception that any such developments could occur, could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, the stability of the global economy and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the euro as a currency, or the reintroduction of an individual currency in Italy, could have major negative effects on our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely affect the economy in Italy, where we provide products and services to our customers. In particular, the departure of Italy from the euro would increase our exposure to changes in currency rates. In addition, the departure of Italy from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate control laws. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

For example, two criminal proceedings are currently pending against two of our managers in relation to different accidents which resulted in serious personal injuries for one of our employees and for one of the employees of a third party company providing on-site services for us. These accidents were allegedly associated with the 55 ----- violation of applicable Italian workplace health and safety regulations. With regard to these proceedings, no final and binding (i.e., non-appealable) decision has been issued as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. One of these criminal proceedings is currently pending against the former technical director (direttore tecnico) and sole director of Castiglia in his position as former legal representative of Castiglia. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021, represented approximately 7.6% of the Group’s Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. This proceeding was initiated by the relevant prosecutors as a result of accidents relating to an employee of Castiglia, who suffered serious personal injuries in 2017 at the premises of certain clients of Castiglia. The second criminal proceeding was initiated against one of our managers, who had been appointed to supervise compliance with health and safety standards for Itelyum Regeneration in relation to an accident occurred at a side managed by Viscolube S.r.l. (now Itelyum Regeneration). In particular, an employee of a third party company providing on-site services to Itelyum Regeneration was severely injured during certain oil discharge operations. Moreover, in June 2021, the abovementioned former sole director of Castiglia was sentenced to one and a half months of imprisonment after a final and binding (i.e., non-appealable) ruling issued against him in his position as former legal representative of Castiglia by the Italian Supreme Court (corte di cassazione) for, among other things, culpable injuries in relation to another accident that occurred in 2014 to another employee of Castiglia, who suffered serious personal injuries during operations carried out at Castiglia premises. While as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, neither Castiglia nor Itelyum Regeneration is party to any criminal proceeding in relation to these accidents, these alleged violations may potentially lead to an assertion of criminal liability for Castiglia and/or Itelyum Regeneration under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001. If Castiglia and/ or Itelyum Regeneration were to be involved in a proceeding under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, a potential conviction of either company could result in, among other things, sanctions and penalties, civil and administrative fines, operational bans (including on a precautionary basis) being imposed on it. Moreover, according to general principles of Italian administrative law, the alleged health and safety violations and the relevant criminal proceedings, besides needing to be mandatorily disclosed to relevant public tendering authorities in the context of the public tender procedures to which Castiglia and Itelyum Regeneration take part pursuant to applicable Italian regulations, could also, irrespective of any potential liability under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, result in the disqualification of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, from future or ongoing tender processes for the awarding of contracts with public entities (both upon a discretional assessment by the competent public contracting authority or upon a decision by an administrative court following a claim by competitors of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, on a case by case basis, and as a general and automatic effect), in particular in the event of a final and binding conviction (i.e. non-appealable) of the managers of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable. In addition, these alleged health and safety violations could potentially trigger the termination of certain ongoing contracts to which Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, is party with public entities and the enforcement of any bid or performance bond provided by Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration to the relevant public contracting entities, where applicable, which could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data, Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma revenue and adjusted recurring capital expenditure provide more granularity regarding the performance of our business after adjusting for additions to our scope of consolidation, assuming that the Acquired Companies had been part of our consolidation perimeter since January 1, 2018. The Acquired Companies are companies we acquired in the period between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021 and, therefore, do not include Castiglia, which we acquired on July 2, 2021. No reconciliation has been provided in this Offering Memorandum from the Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data to the Target Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and _Other Data—Other Financial Data” and “—Unaudited Pro forma Financial Data.”_ This Offering Memorandum also contains management estimates in the calculation of our Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma revenue with respect to the additional Adjusted EBITDA and revenue, respectively, we expect to generate from the acquisition of Castiglia. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other _Data—Other Pro forma Financial Data” and “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.”_ While we believe that this perimeter adjusted financial data can be useful to potential investors seeking to evaluate our performance over time, such financial data has been prepared on a different basis than our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and such information is not intended to be compliant with Italian GAAP or any other accounting standards. Such perimeter adjusted financial data has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management. Our independent auditors have not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the perimeter adjusted financial data for the purpose of their inclusion in this Offering Memorandum. The perimeter adjusted financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines published by any other regulatory or industry body regarding estimates, the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation. The perimeter adjusted financial data is based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are subject to inherent uncertainties and you are strongly cautioned against placing undue reliance thereon. The preparation of the perimeter adjusted financial data requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions with respect to issues such as the reconciliation of accounting policies (such as in respect of revenue recognition). For these reasons, the perimeter adjusted financial data is only a simulation of the Itelyum Group’s results had the relevant acquired businesses been owned for the whole period assumed and is not an indication of what our results would have been if the relevant acquired businesses had been part of the Target Group for such period. The perimeter adjusted financial data is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially had the relevant acquired businesses been owned for the entire period and there are significant differences between the perimeter adjusted financial data and the Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not own or control the Acquired Companies prior to the dates on which control passed in accordance with the relevant acquisition agreements. In some cases, such Acquired Companies were not operated as standalone businesses and therefore certain allocation of headquarters and similar costs have been estimated. Additionally, upon taking control of the Acquired Companies, we implemented our own industrial and distribution strategy which in some cases may have differed in material ways from the prior owners’ strategy. In addition, the pro forma adjustment relating to the impact of the acquisition of Castiglia used to calculate Pro _forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on the information available to us in connection with the acquisition of_ Castiglia, together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. Such adjustment is inherently uncertain 60 ----- and subject to a wide variety of significant uncertainties. Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur to, among other things, integrate Castiglia into the Target Group or any potential synergies or other impacts related to or expected to derive from the acquisition of Castiglia, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of Castiglia would have been for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, if we had acquired Castiglia on July 1, 2020. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated results will be realized. Accordingly, investors should not unduly rely on any of the perimeter adjusted financial data presented in this Offering Memorandum, as such data could significantly differ from our actual future performance. In addition, we will not provide holders with an analysis of any differences between the estimates contained herein and actual results later achieved, and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such estimates under any circumstances. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (including normalized COVID-19 impact), Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro forma adjusted net total financial debt, Pro forma adjusted net interest expense and any associated ratio presented herein are not calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The Issuer may also undertake a special mandatory redemption at any time if, in its good faith judgment, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date. Moreover, if the Completion Date is anticipated to occur within one business day of the Issue Date, the gross proceeds of the Notes will not be deposited into the Escrow Account and will be transferred to the Issuer.

However, the Target (prior to the completion of the Post Completion Merger) and MergerCo (following the completion of the Post Completion Merger), as applicable, will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under Italian GAAP and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Completion Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include, inter alia, intangible assets, such as goodwill. We may also recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, if we provide consolidated financial statements for periods after the Completion Date at the level of the Issuer or MergerCo (instead of the Target), our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum. The Target is currently controlled by the SSCP Sellers. The Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group until completion of the Acquisition. Prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group will not be subject to the covenants described in “Description of Notes.” Holders of the Notes will not be able to rescind their decision to invest in the Notes, including in the event of changes in the financial condition of the Target Group or the terms of the Acquisition.

As of June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of €472.1 million, including €450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes but excluding additional liabilities under recourse factoring for an amount of €11.6 million as of June 30, 2021, and an additional €50.0 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility. We anticipate that we will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes.” The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and liabilities we may incur; 62 ----- - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development or other general corporate purposes; - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future borrowings. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes. Although the terms of the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, such limitations will be subject to exceptions and qualifications and the incurrence of additional indebtedness would exacerbate the risks above. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose.

The Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities upon the Completion Date are expected to be its equity interests in the Target and its outstanding indebtedness and inter-company balances incurred in connection with the Transactions, including its receivables under the Itelyum Proceeds Loans and its indebtedness under the Notes and, if any, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. As a result, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends, principal repayments under the Itelyum Proceeds Loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its outstanding indebtedness service (including under the Notes) and other obligations, and such dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing our indebtedness, including any financing agreements of our subsidiaries. The amounts of dividends and other payments available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. In addition, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes. Following the Post Completion Merger, to a certain extent, the above-mentioned risks will apply to MergerCo. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to transfer cash to the Issuer and, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer or MergerCo, as applicable, will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due. In addition, the aggregate amount of the Itelyum Proceeds Loans is currently expected to be approximately €150.4 million, which is significantly lower than the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes, and we expect that the Itelyum Proceeds 63 ----- Loans will accrue interest at a rate that will be generally consistent with the rate applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the ability of the Issuer to make payments under the Notes will largely depend on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to it, which will be subject to the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective. The subsidiaries of the Issuer or, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees. While the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries or, following the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations will be subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code is the central provision in the Italian legislation regulating merger debt push-downs (thus its application constitutes a safe-harbor vis-a-vis the risk that any such merger can be considered unlawful, also from a financial assistance perspective, with ensuing consequences). In order to complete the Post Completion Merger, there are various steps that we must take, including the preparation of a merger plan, a report by the directors of the companies involved in the Post Completion Merger (relazione dell’organo amministrativo) and a report by an independent expert appointed by the court, assessing the sustainability of debt at the level of MergerCo. Furthermore, Article 2501-bis of the Italian Civil Code is also based on the premise that the merger follows an acquisition of control of the target by another entity. Although there is no specific case law by Italian courts available on the interpretation of this requirement, according to the majority of legal scholars, a change in the direct shareholder holding the majority of the shares in a merging company is sufficient for the requirement to be satisfied (and thus for Article 2501-bis to apply). Our estimation of the timing required to complete the Post Completion Merger is based upon market practice for leveraged buyouts in Italy, which typically involve acquisition vehicles in the form of joint stock companies (società per azioni) where an independent expert is required to be appointed by the competent court, which creates an inherent uncertainty as to the length of time in which the Post Completion Merger can be expected to take place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the independent expert will release its report or that the other steps required for the Post Completion Merger will be taken in a timely manner, or at all. Subject to certain exceptions, the Post Completion Merger can only be implemented following the expiration of 60 days after the latest filing with the competent companies’ registry of the resolutions approving the Post Completion Merger. Within this 60-day deadline, the creditors of the companies involved in the Post Completion Merger are entitled to challenge the Post Completion Merger. Following the Post Completion Merger, in the event that the Target or Itelyum Regeneration is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, MergerCo will, upon consummation of the Post Completion Merger, assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture. Although as of the date of this Offering Memorandum we expect that Itelyum Regeneration will be the surviving entity of the Post Completion Merger, if the Post Completion Merger is ultimately structured such that Itelyum Regeneration is not the surviving entity, or if there is a new resulting entity, then Itelyum Regeneration will be required to transfer licenses and permits relating to the conduct of its business operations to the new entity resulting from the Post Completion Merger. There is no assurance that in such event Itelyum Regeneration will be able to transfer its licenses or permits in a timely manner, or at all, or that our business may not be materially adversely affected as a result. Concurrently with the Post Completion Merger and as a result thereof, the security interest over the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the Itelyum Regeneration Proceeds Loan will be automatically terminated and, depending on which entity will survive the Post Completion Merger, certain other Pre Merger Collateral will be extinguished by operation of law and, in particular, (a) in the event that the Issuer is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, the Target Share Pledge and the pledge over the share capital of Itelyum Regeneration, will be extinguished by operation of law; (b) in the event that the Target is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, the pledge over the share capital of the Issuer and the pledge over the share capital of Itelyum Regeneration will be extinguished by operation of law; and (c) in the event that Itelyum Regeneration is the successor company of the Post Completion Merger, the pledge over the share capital of the Issuer and the Target Share Pledge will be extinguished by operation of law. 64 ----- In addition, subject to and on terms consistent with the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days following completion of the Post Completion Merger, as applicable, MergerCo and Holdco will grant or reconfirm, as applicable, the security interests in the Post Merger Collateral. In the event we are unable to consummate the Post Completion Merger, the Post Merger Collateral will not be granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, and Verde Bidco S.p.A. will remain as the Issuer. In addition, in the event that the Post Completion Merger does not occur on or prior to the Cut-Off Date, in addition to the Pre Merger Collateral, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and certain significant limitations described under “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” by security interests_ granted on a first-priority basis over the Target Group Collateral within 90 days of the Cut-Off Date. In addition, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain significant limitations under Italian law, the Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that, no later than 90 days from the earlier of (i) the Post Completion Merger and (ii) in the event the Post Completion Merger does not occur, the Cut-Off Date, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer guarantee the Notes.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while the Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the_ Revolving Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio.

If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations, which could cause an event of default under our debt and result in: - our debtholders declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; - the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement being able to terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and - our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment in the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

In relation to loans denominated in euro, the Issuer will have the ability to switch to risk free rates prior to June 30, 2023. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with the Revolving Credit Facility, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the Revolving Credit Facility would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. In addition to the above, following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that certain LIBOR settings will permanently cease immediately after December 31, 2021 or after June 30, 2023, as applicable (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the FCA will no longer require any panel banks to continue to submit LIBOR beyond the date from which the panel banks have notified their departure, or to require the ICE Benchmark Association to continue to publish LIBOR on the basis of panel banks submissions beyond such dates. It follows that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after the dates set out in the FCA Announcement. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has further announced on March 5, 2021 that the FCA Announcement constitutes an index cessation event under the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for all LIBOR settings. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which a benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the Revolving Credit Facility having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged 67 ----- increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which a benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Revolving Credit Facility). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, as amended). In addition, the FCA Announcement indicates that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, as applicable. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that (i) any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be and (ii) from the cessation date of LIBOR, the rate of interest applicable to our sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR could affect our ability to meet our obligations under its sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, its sources of funding. Changes in the manner of administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the conditions applicable to our sources of funding or other consequences relevant to our sources of funding. No assurance can be provided that changes will not be made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” in respect of, respectively, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests granted by, respectively, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to each of Itelyum 73 ----- Regeneration and Itelyum Purification, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the respective Guarantee shall not be in force and effect. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any further pari _passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice_ versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the Guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/ or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, and the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto, shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Guarantees and security.

It is possible that a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a grantor of security, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee or grantor’s creation of security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or the relevant security interest should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee or security interest is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent such limitations on the Guarantee or security obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or grantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor or grantor to the extent of such limitations. Future pledges or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims.

The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so in accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraphs.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions until it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction (including by way of payment in advance or otherwise). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of such indebtedness we incur.

See “Description of Notes—Security.” Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with certain property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes.

In particular, even though the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to share the same Collateral and Guarantors’ package, this may not always continue to be the case and circumstances may arise in the future in which lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or guarantees which are not otherwise permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of the Agreed Security Principles and, ultimately, Italian financial assistance and corporate benefit rules.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. As described elsewhere, the extent of the Collateral is limited and, in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, Guarantees and/or security shall only be granted by certain entities. See “Description of Notes—Security.” Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property and certain other assets of the Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges and the amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any direct or indirect transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings similar to (or different from) those that have been or will be required to be obtained in relation to the Acquisition or the Post Completion Merger, or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and any Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties are secured by liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to such assets which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

The applicable hardening, clawback or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected, amended, shared or recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void, ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, in case any security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) is released and retaken at any time, such release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of such security interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Limitations on Validity _and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations.” See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of _Liens.” In Italy, for example, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in_ respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding paragraph.

As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken, including Italian law. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of Italy). In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable provided Italian case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under parallel debt structures, the Parallel Debt will typically be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a _rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_ of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the Security Documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes 80 ----- could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest, the holder of the security interest having difficulty enforcing such holder’s right in Collateral or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on the ability of the holders of the Notes to receive proceeds from any enforcement of the Collateral.

As set forth in “Description of Notes—Meeting of Holders of Notes,” the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change 81 ----- the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision to increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court, with the consequence that the majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to 50%. Furthermore, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also largely untested in the Italian courts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

There is a rebuttable presumption that the “center of main interest” as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions, including Italy, may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ Although laws differ across jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor, the enforceability of any other guarantee of the Notes and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest or the Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantee and the security interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the security interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. 82 ----- If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or security interests are found to be a preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or if otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantor and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Guarantees and the _Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the security interests created, the Guarantors or security provider: - issued such Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Guarantee or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due; - the Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor or collateral provider; or - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any security interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we and the Target Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantee were issued or the security interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the security interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors 83 ----- under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the insolvency administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any clawback action. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and _the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information._ Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. In addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU. If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantee and security interests, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification under the relevant Itelyum Proceeds Loans. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it cannot be excluded that a court may find the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions of the Italian Civil Code to be applicable in respect of the relevant Itelyum Proceeds Loan borrowed by Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that Itelyum Regeneration’s and Itelyum Purification’s 84 ----- obligations under the relevant Itelyum Proceeds Loan are subordinated to all its obligations to other creditors. Should any of Itelyum Regeneration’s and Itelyum Purification’s obligations under the relevant Itelyum Proceeds Loan be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the Itelyum Proceeds Loan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans (including the Itelyum Proceeds Loans) or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including, subject to the Agreed Security Principles certain significant limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Guarantee to be provided by Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification) may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer and may need to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes.

A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness (even if such change of control under such other indebtedness may be deemed not to be a change of control for the purposes of the Indenture). Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.

A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of EBITDA (i.e., risultato operativo lordo _della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”), as well as 30% of ROL carried forward from previous fiscal years. The_ ROL is calculated on the basis of the value of the items of the Issuer’s profit and loss account, which are comprised of the operating gross revenues and expenses (excluding depreciation of tangible and intangible assets, as well as leasing fees), as determined through the application of the tax rules concerning the 86 ----- determination of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense in a fiscal year can be carried forward for the following five fiscal years. The amount of any interest income exceeding the interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward without time limits. Interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years and deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income (also carried forward from previous fiscal years) is lower than 30% of ROL. In the case of an Italian tax group (consolidato fiscale nazionale), interest expense not deducted by an entity within the tax group due to lack interest income or of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level, within the limit of the excess interest income and excess of ROL of the other companies within the tax group. This 30% threshold applies to the Italian subsidiaries of the Issuer only. Article 96 does not apply to certain entities active in the insurance and financial sector. In addition, the Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged merger leverage buyout transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with acquisition financing. However, on March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter No. 6/E (“Circular Letter”) clarifying, as a common principle, that interest on the acquisition bank loan in leveraged buy-out transactions are generally deductible for IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary limitations stated in Article 96 and excluding certain cases of reinvestment (also partial) by the seller(s). In case an acquisition is considered as entered into by one or more entities that are related parties to the seller(s), the deduction of interest expenses may be challenged by the tax authorities based on anti-abuse provisions, depending on the existence of non-marginal business reasons for the debt-financed acquisition. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan or debt, when the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than the ones of the previous financing transaction. In particular, in such circumstances, the relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing does not relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed as “anti-economic” and as such not compliant with the “inherence” principle set out under Italian tax law). Italian tax laws and pronouncements of the tax authorities are subject to change and positions that the Target Group takes for tax purposes may be challenged. Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the use of proceeds from the Offering to make a refinancing under the “inherence” principle and/or to make an acquisition under the anti-abuse provision, we may be unable to deduct our interest expenses and/or be subject to significant penalties or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

Leveraging upon our distinctive chemical and recycling competences across our business units, we provide circular economy solutions to a wide and diversified client base across a variety of industries, including the automotive and pharmaceutical industries. Our mission is to act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps for the industrial waste streams, with particular focus on recycling and regeneration activities. Our services include the collection of waste, preliminary sorting and storage of waste, second level treatment of wastewater and oil emulsions, the preparation of waste for energy recovery or any other final destination plant through specific and specialized chemical treatments, waste oil re-refining (or regeneration) and waste solvent purification. Our products include lubricant-based oils, bitumen additives and gas oil, as well as a wide range of complex recovered waste-based thinners, solvent from waste and pure solvents. We also provide environmental consulting and chemical analysis services in respect of different types of matrices (e.g., water, soil and air) through our in-house network of accredited laboratories, and offer complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste and solvents. We are the leader in the Italian oil regeneration industry, with an approximately 89% market share as of December 31, 2019, and one of the market leaders in Europe by oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share (measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output as of December 31, 2019). We are also the leader in the Italian waste solvent purification industry, with a 50% market share by revenue and an approximately 37% market share by production capacity as of December 31, 2019, and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe, with a 34% market share as of December 2019. In addition, we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of hazardous waste in Italy in 2019 through our Environment business unit. The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits from higher barriers to entry compared to the industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste markets due to strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical skills required for the waste management processes. Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has demonstrated a high level of profitability and resiliency, including during periods of economic difficulties, recording a CAGR of approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014 compared to a negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP over the same period. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of €406.1 million, €85.0 million and €92.0 million, respectively. We have a large, diversified and established customer base comprising approximately 30,000 customers, ranging from large corporates to family-owned SMEs. We have long-standing relationships with the large majority of our top 20 customers, in certain cases spanning over a decade. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top 20 customers (excluding CONOU) accounted for 23.6% of our revenue. Our customers include oil companies and blenders, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, including blue chip brands such as Eni, Total, Petronas, 97 ----- Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi. While all of our operating sites are located in Italy, we benefit from a global commercial reach, serving over 60 countries through a network of local distributors. We have a strong geographical footprint in Italy, especially in its Northern regions. We currently operate 12 waste storage sites and 13 waste treatment and recycling facilities, including four plants for industrial wastewater treatment, two plants for lubricant oil regeneration, two plants for purification and blending of solvents and five treatment and pre-treatment plants. We have approximately 800 full-time employees (accounting for the acquisition of Castiglia in July 2021). We offer our products and services through three business units: - **Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a comprehensive range of environmental services, mostly in hazardous waste management and, to a lesser extent, in non-hazardous waste management covering a broad spectrum of the value chain, with an emphasis on recycling and recovery activities. Our Environment portfolio includes sustainable services and solutions for the industrial waste market such as (i) collection, transportation, first level treatment and storage, (ii) consulting services and laboratory analysis carried out through our network of ten accredited laboratories, (iii) industrial wastewater treatment and (iv) solid waste treatment. In addition, we offer complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste. Our exposure to third-party-operated landfills and incinerators is limited, accounting for approximately 12% of the total volume of our end-of-waste destinations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Environment business unit were €143.5 million and €29.6 million, respectively, representing 35.3% and 34.8%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. - **Regeneration. Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process that transforms waste oil, a hazardous waste, into a valuable product. Our used oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano primarily produce regenerated lubricant bases and, to a lesser extent, diesel oil and other by-products. We believe that the high quality and price competitiveness of our regenerated lubricant bases (comparable to virgin oils), underpinned by our proprietary re-refining technology enabling the Group to process a wide spectrum of feedstock qualities, represents a strong competitive advantage over many of our competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Regeneration business unit were €117.8 million and €34.5 million, respectively, representing 29.0% and 40.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. - **Purification. Our Purification business unit comprises the production and sale of a variety of solvents derived both from the valorization of chemical waste, including thinners and solvents from waste (“SFW”), and virgin raw materials, including pure aliphatics. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Purification business unit were €144.8 million and €20.9 million, respectively, representing 35.7% and 24.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we directly managed approximately 837 thousand tons of waste materials, primarily consisting of lubricant oil, solvents, industrial hazardous water, waste treatment for energy valorization and other waste (excluding intermediated waste), with hazardous and non-hazardous waste accounting for 71% and 29%, respectively, of these volumes, and solid and liquid waste accounting for 19% and 81%, respectively, of these volumes. For the same period, we managed and processed approximately 1,174 thousand tons of waste (including intermediated waste).

Conversely, in periods of weak growth or recession, volumes tend to decrease due to lower economic activity, which decreases the waste volumes that we collect. As 78.8% of our revenue was generated in Italy for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and almost all the waste we collect and treat derives from Italy, our results of operations are particularly dependent on the general economic conditions and developments in Italy. A downturn in the Italian economy can affect our customers’ spending generally, demand and pricing for our products and services, the creditworthiness of our customers, and the availability and cost of our debt financings. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian economy contracted sharply in the first quarter of 2020, recording a year-on-year contraction in GDP of 5.1% and entering a new recession, followed by a 11.8% year-on-year decrease in the second quarter of 2020, which was the worst year-on-year decrease of GDP since records began in 1995 (source: ISTAT) as the country was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. 99 ----- See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially _affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.” As a result of the restrictive measures_ introduced by the Italian government, such as social distancing measures, the nationwide lockdowns of most business activities in the first half of 2020, we transitioned a portion of our workforce to remote working and experienced operational difficulties; in particular, our plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano were closed for several weeks between April and June 2020. Several restrictive measures have continued to be in place in Italy during 2020 and in the first half of 2021. These difficulties have created a context of uncertainty that has impacted our results in 2020, including in terms of revenues and margins. Our Regeneration business was particularly impacted by the decline in collected used oil and production slowdown in the first half of 2020, resulting in a decrease in our production volumes of base oil of approximately 17% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue and EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 from our Regeneration activities decreased by 12.8% and 33.2%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2021, general economic conditions began to improve as a result of proactive measures to control the spread of the infection and the rollout of vaccines, although a new wave of infections driven by the outbreak of the “Delta” variant has hit several countries, including Italy. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, as a result of recovering economic conditions in Italy, our Regeneration business unit registered a significant increase, processing 89.1 thousand tons of waste oil compared to 53.0 thousand tons processed during the same period of 2020 (an increase of 68.1%) and recording sales of 62.7 thousand tons of base oil compared to 42.6 thousand tons during the same period of 2020 (an increase of 47.2%). The results recorded by our Regeneration business unit for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 showed a favorable trend when compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2019, which were not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we processed 184.4 thousand tons of waste oil and sold 122.4 thousand tons of base oil through our Regeneration business unit compared to 181.0 and 122.1 thousand tons, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019 (an increase of 1.9% and 0.2%, respectively). As there can be no assurance as to how long certain temporary closures and restrictions may remain in effect or when new restrictions may be re-implemented, we are currently unable to estimate the magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, and the results of operations and cash flows for future periods may not be comparable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to revenues, EBITDA, margins, cash flow, cost and revenue synergies and return on investment targets before we proceed with the acquisition. Between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021, we acquired controlling stakes in or the entire share capital of ten companies (excluding the transactions where we only increased our stake in previously acquired companies and companies that were already controlled by the acquired companies). In particular, we made five acquisitions in 2018 and five acquisitions in 2020. The acquisition of the remaining minority stakes in the acquired companies for which we are currently holding controlling interests is subject to call and put options. See “—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Bolt-on _acquisitions.”_ We believe that the acquisitions we made in the period under review have generated synergies for our business and have contributed to our organic growth. Such acquisitions have given us, for example, the ability to enrich our product portfolio and service offering, and expand our customer base and geographic reach. Historically, we have funded our bolt-on acquisitions primarily with cash from operations, as well as third-party debt.

Given the largely fixed cost nature of our business and the high processing capacity of our waste management sites, higher volumes generally allow us to keep a site at an optimal utilization, thereby utilizing our machinery and personnel more efficiently and therefore reducing the impact of our fixed cost base. Moreover, 100 ----- waste volumes affect our logistics costs, as an increase in collected waste typically results in higher transportation costs. The table below sets forth the components of our income statement that are mostly affected by volume of serviced waste (i.e., revenue and purchase, services and other charges) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended June 30, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Pursuant to the enactment of Italian Legislative Decree no. 152 of April 3, 2006 (the_ “Environmental Code”), CONOU has set up an incentive mechanism paid to oil regeneration companies, the CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lube oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), thus ensuring that we and other players in the oil regeneration industry are granted certain downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lube oil prices. In accordance with the Italian Environmental Code, lube oil producers fund the oil regeneration value chain by paying to CONOU an amount determined as set forth by applicable law and regulatory framework, which was equal to approximately €0.09 on average over the period 2011-2020 for each litre of lubricant oil sold. CONOU distributes the amounts so collected via, inter alia, the regeneration treatment fee. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee is paid to oil regeneration companies on a monthly basis based on the volumes of regenerated oil bases produced and is calculated based on the ICIS average price of lube oil recorded during the preceding quarter. The time lag associated with the calculation of the CONOU regeneration treatment fee, together with the increase recorded by oil prices in the first half of 2021 and the increase in volume of oil bases produced, has favorable impacted our margin for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020, which was also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these factors, the CONOU regeneration treatment fee we collected for the six months ended June 30, 2021 amounted to €17.3 million, an increase of €7.8 million, or 82.1%, over the amount of €9.5 million collected for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee sustains the circularity in all the phases of the waste oil economic cycle, is based on the principle of the Extended Producer Responsibility (“EPR”) and permits us to significantly offset the cyclical decrease in oil price by guaranteeing a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products. See “Business—CONOU Incentive Mechanisms.” Revenue from our Regeneration business unit accounted for 29.6% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. The table below sets out the amount of CONOU regeneration treatment fee, including as a percentage of revenue generated by our Regeneration business unit, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021. 101 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

We believe that the size and density of our network in Northern Italy, our large and diversified customer base and our presence across the entire waste services value chain constitute key competitive advantages that enable us effectively manage our costs and increase the efficiency of our operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The main regulations affecting our business are the waste management regulatory framework in the European Union, currently governed by the directive 2008/98/EC, as recently amended by directive 2018/851/EU, and the REACH regulation, which imposes significant obligations on the chemicals industry with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of substances. We are also subject to the EU ETS System governing GHG emissions and the Environmental Code which governs, _inter alia, the management of waste in Italy and the granting of the permits for the opening and management of_ waste management plants. See “Regulation.” In addition, from time to time, we may incur remediation costs at our current facilities and as of June 30, 2021, we had made provisions of €6.4 million for potential environmental liabilities and ecological clean-ups that may be necessary at certain of our facilities. If environmental harm is found to have occurred as a result of our current or historical operations, we may incur significant remediation costs and pay fines and damages. Our environmental compliance and remediation costs could therefore increase. Our provisions for environmental liabilities are expected to increase as a result of our entry into of the Lauro Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which we undertook to bear the costs of certain environmental remediation activities relating to the Landriano purification site, estimated to be approximately €8.0 million as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Such amount is expected to be budgeted as provision for environmental liabilities on our balance sheet. We expect to incur these costs over the period 2021-2030. For further details, see “Summary—Recent Developments— _Settlement Agreements Relating to the Vendor Loan Liabilities.” See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations are subject to an increasingly demanding level of governmental regulations, especially in regards to the environment,” “—Maintaining compliance with the chemical safety regulations applicable to both our products and raw materials could adversely affect our business,” and “—We may face liabilities in connection with environmental matters.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The prices of raw materials we use in, or produced through, our waste management solutions, such as base oil or aliphatics, fluctuate according to global economic supply and demand, especially levels of economic growth. For example, the selling prices of aliphatics, which are produced through our Purification activities, are based on the market price of virgin naphtha, which decreased by 22.7% over the period 2018-2020. Conversely, when prices of our raw materials increase, we attempt to mitigate the negative effect on our margins by seeking to pass through raw material cost increases to our customers through higher prices for our products, although we sometimes experience a limited time lag in our ability to do so in relation to our mid-term contracts, which represent approximately half of our contracts and have a typical duration of two to three years. 102 ----- In addition, our business is also exposed to fluctuations in costs related to certain commodities, such as methane, fuel and electricity, that are widely used in our business for logistic and production purposes. Prices for oil and electricity are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand, change in applicable laws and regulations, adverse weather and regional production patterns.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

This trend has grown in recent year due to greater weight assumed by our Environment trading activities over the same period. Despite this limited seasonal effect, we believe our overall results are relatively stable as a result of the diversification of our product portfolio and breadth of our service offering.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

However, we carry out operations in currencies other than the euro, principally in U.S. dollars, and our results of operations are therefore impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is for the purchases of certain raw materials and sales of certain of our products in U.S. dollars, which results, to a certain extent, in a natural hedging (whereby the effects of revenues and costs in U.S. dollars partially offset each other). Foreign exchange exposure has typically been relevant to our Purification business unit, which recorded 13.8% of its revenue in U.S. dollars for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, corresponding to 5.0% of our revenue for the period. Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the euro-equivalent amount based on the exchange rate set on the transaction date, while the exchange differences realized at the date of collection or payment are recorded in the income statement as foreign exchange gains or losses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Under the current framework, which came into force in October 2020, the regeneration treatment fee is no longer subject to a set cap that was historically set at €329 per ton of regeneration oil and limited the amount of compensation granted to oil regeneration companies during periods of fluctuations in oil prices. We estimate that the removal of the set cap as well as other amendments to the formula, on a pro forma basis for the year 2020 as if the new formula had been in place as of January 1, 2020, would have had an estimated positive impact of €2.2 million, €2.1 million, €1.9 million and €1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. We expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after December 2024, except in exceptional circumstances indicated in CONOU regulation which, in any event cannot be retroactive. Any significant amendment to the formula and the current framework for incentive mechanics established by CONOU may have a material impact on the profitability of our Regeneration business unit.

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.7,Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations,17.7.1,Bolt-on acquisitions,"We have historically expanded our operations through small and medium-size bolt-on acquisitions, thereby expanding our geographical reach as well as the volumes and the type of waste we collect and process. Many of the acquisitions we have completed in recent years were aimed at consolidating our market position, enhancing our product offering and driving operational efficiencies. Our results of operations during the periods under review have been affected by such acquisitions, which may make it more difficult to evaluate the historical performance of our business by comparing period over period results. The most significant bolt-on acquisitions we carried out in the period between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2021 are described below. _Centro Risorse, Area S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l., Keoma S.r.l, Ecoausilia S.r.l. and Ecoserve S.r.l. In April_ 2018, we acquired 70% of the equity interests in Centro Risorse S.r.l., Area S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l., Keoma S.r.l and Ecoausilia S.r.l., for an aggregated acquisition consideration of €12.0 million including deferred payments, price adjustments and earn-outs. The acquisition of the remaining 30% of the equity interest in Centro Risorse S.r.l., Area S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l. and Keoma S.r.l. is subject to put and call options. These companies are specialized in the management and valorization of industrial waste, wastewater treatment, chemical analysis, transport and environment and safety consultancy services. All of the equity interests in Ecoausilia S.r.l. and Ecoserve S.r.l. was subsequently acquired in 2020 and these companies were merged into our subsidiary Neda Ambiente FVG S.r.l. _Carbo-Nafta Ecologia. In January 2020, we acquired a 80% stake in Carbo Nafta Ecologia S.r.l. for €2.7 million,_ including price adjustment and deferred payments; a potential earn-out could be payable in April 2022 for a maximum amount of €0.6 million. The acquisition of the remaining 20% of the equity interest in Carbo Nafta Ecologia S.r.l. is subject to put and call options. Carbo Nafta Ecologia S.r.l. operates in the collection and management of industrial waste. This acquisition enabled us to strengthen our competitive position in Central Italy, in particular in the regions of Umbria, Lazio and Tuscany. _Idroclean. In February 2020, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Idroclean S.r.l., which in turn held the_ entire equity interests in its subsidiaries Agrid S.r.l. and Labio.Lab S.r.l. as well as a 30% stake in ASMia, for 103 ----- €19.8 million, including price adjustment and deferred payments. The Idroclean group primarily operates in Lombardy and Northern Italy and it is specialized in the treatment and purification of industrial water mainly for pharmaceutical and chemical companies. Although we own only 30% of the share capital in ASMia, as of June 30, 2021, we consolidate 68% of the income statement of ASMia into our consolidated income statement, as we have contractual arrangements with the other shareholders of ASMia pursuant to which we are deemed to control ASMia for purposes of the consolidation principles under Italian GAAP. The balance sheet of ASMia is otherwise consolidated in our balance sheet for 30%, which is in line with our ownership percentage. _Intereco. In July 2020, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Intereco S.r.l., for €12.1 million, including_ price adjustment and deferred payments; a potential earn-out payment could be due by the end of 2021 for a maximum amount of €0.6 million. Intereco S.r.l. is a company specialized in recycling and valorization solutions for hazardous and non-hazardous special waste. This acquisition enabled us to strengthen our position in Northern and Central Italy thanks to Intereco S.r.l.’s strong client base across the industrial district in EmiliaRomagna, with a focus on ceramic tiles. _Ferolmet. In October 2020, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Ferolmet S.r.l., which in turn holds 86%_ of the equity interest in Riraee S.r.l., for €9.2 million, including a price adjustment already paid and deferred payments; a potential earn-out payment could be due in April 2022 and April 2023 for a maximum aggregated amount of €1.9 million. Ferolmet S.r.l. is a company based near Milan, and operates primarily in the Northern part of Italy, which is specialized in storage and preparation activities for recycling and valorization solutions for hazardous and non-hazardous special waste. All acquired companies (except for ASMia, which operates under its own brand) have been integrated within the Itelyum Group and are operating under the Itelyum brand. We intend to continue our selective external growth strategy by acquiring small to medium-sized regional and national businesses in Italy as well as, potentially, neighboring countries that are complementary to our service and product offerings and offer synergies and ease of integration. Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several ways. First, our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired businesses in our consolidated results. As the acquired businesses are included in our consolidation perimeter from the date of completion of the relevant acquisition, their full impact is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period. Following an acquisition, we seek to integrate the companies into our structure. For example, we typically coordinate administration, finance and treasury, IT, human resources and other support functions with our central management functions, and seek to leverage our national network and commercial structure in order to increase the waste volumes processed at the sites that are acquired. We also generally keep and strengthen local management teams, which we believe increases the chance of a smooth integration of the acquired company. On July 2, 2021, we acquired 70% of the equity interests in Castiglia, a company providing integrated services for environmental protection and sustainability with a particular focus on the management of waste deriving from water purification processes. The acquisition of the remaining 30% of the equity interest in Castiglia is subject to call and put options. Through the acquisition of Castiglia, we expect to enhance our market position in the Southern regions of Italy. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Acquisition of Castiglia.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.48,Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates,17.48.1,,"The preparation of financial statements requires our management to apply accounting principles and methods which, in certain circumstances, are based on difficult and subjective estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable from time to time and realistic according to the relative circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the financial statements and other information provided in this Offering Memorandum. These estimates and assumptions used are based on past experience and other factors considered relevant. However, actual results could differ from the estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the impacts of any resulting changes are recognized directly in the income statement in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision impacts only that period, or also in future periods, if the revision impacts both the current and future periods. The most significant accounts concerned by these uncertainties are: (i) valuation of goodwill; (ii) evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets; (iii) depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets; (iv) environmental liabilities; (v) provision for risks and charges and bad debt provision; and (vi) the inventory obsolescence provision. In addition, the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum have been impacted by the revaluation of property, plant and equipment carried out pursuant to Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020. _Valuation of Goodwill_ Valuation of goodwill involves a complex procedure that requires the application of various valuation methods, including the identification and measurement of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities taken on, and is often carried out by independent experts. These methods use the following inputs: historical information, forecasts based on estimates or on observation of the market e.g. the royalty rate for the use of comparable assets, the discount rate, the residual useful life of the assets acquired, etc. 117 ----- _Evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_ We conduct different impairment tests for each business units. For the year ended December 31, 2020, such impairment tests were made on the basis of economic and financial projection of our Group for the period 2021-2025. The forecasts are based on the assumptions characterized by intrinsic uncertainty, both with reference to macroeconomic and sector conditions as well as specific conditions tied to our Itelyum Group, based on the current status and knowledge of the pandemic crisis at the time the estimate was made. _Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets_ Depreciation rates of the property, plant and equipment and the amortization rates of goodwill and other intangible assets are calculated based on the best estimate of the residual useful life of the assets linked to production carried out the Itelyum Group’s experts and directors. _Environmental liabilities_ We are subject to numerous laws and regulations on environmental protection at European, national, regional and local level. The measurement of future liabilities in connection with remediation and restoration obligations in relation to the sites and/or land on which our Group carries out its business is a complex process based on technical and financial assumptions made by our management and supported by independent experts, where necessary. The estimates are reviewed at each balance sheet date to verify that the amounts recorded are the best reflection of the costs our Group will face. If any significant variations are found, the amounts are adjusted. The key factors for revising cost estimates are the developments in the technologies and the environmental regulations. Measurement of environmental liabilities recorded in the financial statements takes into account the environmental legislation currently in force. Measurements could be subject to significant variations in relation to: (i) the possibility of further contamination; (ii) the results of current and future refurbishment and the other possible effects arising from applicable laws; (iii) the possible effects of new laws and regulations relating environmental protection; (iv) the effects of any technological innovations for environmental cleansing; and (v) the possibility of disputes concerning environmental liabilities for specific sites and the difficulty of determining the potential consequences, including in relation to the liability to other parties and any indemnity. _Provisions for risks and charges and bad debt provision_ Our financial statements reflects the estimate of liabilities based on the best knowledge of solvency of the counterparts and the status of litigation, on the basis of the information provided by legal and tax advisors as well as considering the outstanding contracts with our counterparts. The estimate of these risks is subject to uncertainties. _Inventory obsolescence provision_ The inventory obsolescence provision reflects the management’s estimate of our Group’s expected losses in value, determined on the basis of past experience. Abnormal market price trends could have repercussions in future inventory write-downs. _Revaluation pursuant to Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020_ In 2020, we have exercised the option provided under art. 110 of Law Decree 104/2020, converted into Law no. 126 of October 13, 2020, and registered the revaluation of selected property, plant and equipment for a number of our subsidiaries. The higher value of property, plant and equipment was determined by comparing the fair value of the assets, as indicated in the report prepared by a third party expert, with the residual net book value, after the depreciation for the year 2020. In particular, the fair value of the assets was determined by applying an evaluation process based on its hypothetical replacement with a new similar asset. Its maximum value has been determined and it is identifiable with the cost the Itelyum Group would incur to replace it or with its exact replica (“new construction cost”) or, alternatively, if less, with that of an assets with equivalent characteristics and production capacities (“replacement cost”). 118 ----- Subsequently, the maximum value of the assets was reduced to take into account the loss of value from the “physical depreciation” and from the “functional obsolescence” which measure their loss of value with respect to a new one. On the basis of the expert estimate, our Group has entered higher values in Property, plant and equipment for €163.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The expert estimate attests that the net book value after revaluation does not exceed the recoverable amount likely to be attributable in relation to the production capacity and the possibility of using the relevant property, plant and equipment by the companies and in relation to its current value. For the purposes of this revaluation we used the accounting technique of increasing the historical cost (gross amount) up to the level of fair value of the asset and reducing the accumulated depreciation. As a result of the assessment carried out, we opted for an extension of the period of the original depreciation, resulting from an assessment of the residual useful life of the assets by management, taking into account the expert estimate. All the relevant subsidiaries have also opted to the substitute tax, equal to 3% of the revaluation, to recognize it for tax purposes. The table below shows the effect of the revaluation on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.1,,"We are a leading European circular economy player specializing in the collection, sorting and recycling complex streams of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Leveraging upon our distinctive chemical competences across our integrated business units, we provide circular economy solutions to a wide and diversified customer base comprising approximately 30,000 customers across a variety of industries, including the construction, automotive and pharmaceutical industries. We operate across the special and industrial hazardous waste management value chain (excluding direct management of landfill and incineration and excluding urban waste management). We have a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities and benefit from strong chemical know-how and access to treatment and recycling alternatives for complex hazardous waste streams. We believe that the combination of our business units have enabled us to build a significant competitive advantage within the Italian waste management market, establishing our position as a leading one-stop shop service provider of circular economy solutions for a wide range of customers across various industries. For the twelve month ended June 30, 2021, we directly managed and processed approximately 837 thousand tons of waste materials (excluding intermediated waste), primarily consisting of lube oil, solvents, industrial hazardous water, waste treatment for energy valorization and other waste, with hazardous and non-hazardous waste accounting for 71% and 29%, respectively, of these volumes, and solid and liquid waste accounting for 19% and 81%, respectively, of these volumes. We offer our services and products through three business units: - **_Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a comprehensive range of environmental services in hazardous and non-hazardous waste management covering a broad spectrum of the value chain. - **_Regeneration: Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process. Our used oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano primarily produce regenerated lube bases, diesel oil and other by-products for applications in bituminous membranes lube bases and, to a lesser extent, diesel oil and other by-products. - **_Purification. Our Purification business unit, with an authorized capacity of 100 thousand tons per year, comprises the production and trading of a variety of solvents derived from the valorization of chemical waste, including thinners and SFW. In addition, we also produce pure solvent and starting materials for APIs from virgin raw materials. As 78.9% of our revenue was generated in Italy for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and almost all the waste we collect and treat derives from Italy, our results of operations are particularly dependent on the general economic conditions and developments in Italy. Based on studies conducted by Oxford Economics, Italy’s GDP is expected to grow from €1.65 trillion in 2020 to an estimated €1.88 trillion in 2024. A detailed breakdown of Italy’s forecasted GDP growth is set out below: _Source: Oxford Economics – Country Economic Forecast Italy (July 14, 2021). Forecasted GDP based on real year-on-year growth_ 120 ----- This projected macroeconomic recovery is expected to translate into higher industrial production in Italy and, consequently, increased levels of hazardous waste production. Various measures of Italian economic recovery, such as industrial production, retail sales and car registrations, have bounced back in 2021 to their respective pre-COVID-19 levels, demonstrating the strong year-on-year recovery of the Italian economy. These measures have been aided by the deployment of an approximately €190 billion EU recovery fund. A detailed snapshot of the abovementioned metrics is set out below: _Source: Oxford Economics – Country Economic Forecast Italy (July 14, 2021). Forecasted GDP based on real year-on-year growth_ On the policy front, the Italian government is increasingly focusing on sustainability, with approximately €70 billion from the EU recovery fund allocated to the “Green Revolution and Ecological Transition.” Among various areas of intervention, particular attention is being paid to the enhancement of waste recycling capabilities, through (i) the injection of new liquidity into the sector, improvement of waste management plants and systems, and introduction of circular economy programs with specific recycling targets, (ii) the integration of eco-design, eco-products, “blue economy” and bio-economy into the new national strategy for the circular economy, expected to be adopted by June 2022, (iii) the development of a national program for waste management to more effectively analyze national data and achieve sustainability targets, and (iv) the provision of technical support to regional authorities to optimize the management of green public procurements.

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Hazardous Waste Management Market,18.2.1,,"_Overview_ Hazardous waste management in Italy is regulated by precise norms, with authorizations granted to manage specific waste types, classified by specific waste characterization codes defined at the European level. Our addressable market in Italy consisted of 9.1 million tons of hazardous waste in 2019. In comparison, the urban waste market in Italy consisted of approximately 30 million tons in 2019 while the non-hazardous waste market consisted of approximately 131.2 million tons in 2019. We focus on (i) waste management and water treatment, (ii) solvent, chemical and organic process and (iii) oil waste and other liquid fuel, comprising 31%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of the addressable market in 2019, which have grown at a CAGR of 3.4%, 1.8% and 3.3%, 121 ----- respectively, over a five-year period from 2014 to 2019. A detailed breakdown of the addressable Italian hazardous waste market, by category and by CAGR from 2014 to 2019, is set out below: _Source: Market Consultant Analyst_ Moreover, volumes of recycled hazardous waste (our reference market) in Italy have been growing, and are expected to continue to grow, at a faster pace than the overall market. From 2014 to 2019, recycled hazardous waste volumes increased at a CAGR of 4.4%, while other hazardous waste volumes decreased at a CAGR of 1.9% over the same period. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted industrial activity in 2020 and 2021, resulting in an expected 8.6 million tons of Italian hazardous waste in 2021 (down from 9.1 million tons in 2019). Between 2021 and 2025, while the overall hazardous waste market in Italy is expected to grow broadly in line with industrial production (at a CAGR of 1.9%), recycled waste volumes are once again expected to outperform the general market, growing at a CAGR of 2.9% over the same period. Besides a general secular trend towards recycling, this trend will result from regulatory restrictions on new authorizations for Italian landfills and incinerators, which are currently operating at almost full capacity, resulting in the price increases described below and the need for alternatives to landfill disposal and incineration. The evolution of volumes in the Italian hazardous waste market from 2014 to 2025 is set out below: _Source: Market Consultant Analyst_ From a pricing perspective, hazardous waste treatment fees in Italy recorded a significant increase at a CAGR of approximately 10-15% from 2017 to 2019 primarily due to increasing industrial production and “traditional” end-of-waste destinations, such as incinerators and landfills, reaching close to maximum capacity. In 2019, hazardous waste treatment fees in Italy for liquid and solid waste ranged from €50-300 per ton and €300-700 per ton, respectively. In contrast, non-hazardous waste treatment fees in Italy during 2019 for liquid and solid waste ranged from €40-50 per ton and €150-250 per ton, respectively. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 122 ----- industrial output and the increased capacity of alternative end-of-waste destinations stabilized prices from 2019 to 2020 (with this trend expected to continue in 2021), prices are projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4-5% from 2021 to 2025 as a result of (i) increased industrial production as part of a post-COVID-19 recovery, driving volumes to a level similar to those in 2019, (ii) regulatory restrictions on new authorizations for other end-of-waste destinations, increasing the supply-demand imbalance, and (iii) increasing export costs. The evolution of the value of the recycling subsect of the Italian hazardous waste market between 2014 and 2025 is set out below: _Source: Market Consultant Analyst Market Share_ We enjoy a strong market position in Italy where, through our Environment business unit, we managed approximately 4% of the total volume of hazardous waste for the year ended December 31, 2019. This figure is calculated as the volumes directly managed by our Environment business unit as a percentage of the total volume in the hazardous waste market (including waste that is not recycled), therefore excluding volumes managed or processed by our Purification and Regeneration business units. In addition, we are local market leaders in most regions in which we operate. _Competitors_ Despite its first signs of consolidation, the Italian waste management market remains highly fragmented. From 2012 to 2018, the number of companies in the Italian waste management space decreased by 4.1%, from 6,139 to 5,890, with large companies (i.e., companies employing more than 250 persons), growing both in number (from 75 in 2012 to 90 in 2018) and size (from an average annual turnover of €78 million in 2012 to €91 million in 2018).

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Used Oil Regeneration Market,18.3.1,,"_Overview_ The Italian lubricant oil market has the highest level of circularity in Europe, with 99% of collected oil being regenerated, as opposed to approximately 50% in the rest of Europe. This is driven by a stable self-sustaining incentive mechanism offsetting oil price fluctuations, regulated by a private Italian consortium promoting and supporting waste oil collection and regeneration activities (CONOU). A large and growing European lubricant oil end-market, with an increasing share of regenerated lubricant oil, generates pricing upside. The chart below sets forth the percentage of collected oil being regenerated on average in the EU and certain key European countries in 2018. In 2020, consumption of lubricant oil in Italy amounted to 370 thousand tons, with the industrial sector accounting for approximately 55% of the overall volume and the remainder coming from automotive applications. Consumption was stable between 2014 and 2019, growing at a CAGR of 1.2% over this period, driven by: (i) a new mechanism introduced in the automotive industry that generated increased oil consumption in the sector at a CAGR of 1.0% between 2014 and 2019, and (ii) a steady increase in industrial production. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to an approximately 10% reduction in overall oil consumption in 2020 (from 410 thousand tons in 2019 to 370 thousand tons in 2020, mainly driven by lower automotive use during the government-imposed lockdown), a partial recovery is anticipated in 2021, with total consumption expected to rise to 396 thousand tons. Lubricant oil consumption is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.2% between 2021 and 2025, mainly driven by the industrial sector growing at a CAGR of 1.6%, while automotive consumption is expected to remain relatively stable, impacted by the increasing penetration of electric vehicles. In particular, full-electric vehicles (“BEVs”) are expected to represent only a limited share of the Italian car park by 2025, consequently limiting their adverse impact on lubricant oil consumption. As electric vehicle penetration requires significant investment in recharging infrastructure, a mere 1% of the Italian car park is expected to consist of BEVs by 2025. Moreover, the impact of BEVs on the lubricant oil market is expected to be limited to engine and transmission applications only, with junctions, suspensions and other automotive applications still expected to use lubricant oils and greases. On the other hand, hybrid and plug-in cars (“HEVs”), which continue to use a traditional engine alongside an electric motor, are not expected to have any significant impact on lubricant oil consumption as they consume 124 ----- comparable quantities of lubricant oil to traditional combustion engine cars.

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Solvent Purification Market,18.4.1,,"_Overview_ The Italian solvent purification market shows high circularity, growing waste supply and an increasing incidence of recycling as an end-of-waste destination, in addition to benefiting from a large and growing global end-market. The waste purification market is expected to continue growing at a steady pace, driven by: (i) increasing waste production, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, (ii) the reduction of waste volumes sent to incineration and (iii) the demand for sustainable waste management solutions enabled by additional authorizations under approval (estimated to generate approximately 95 kilotons of additional capacity, part of which is expected to be to our benefit). In 2019, the Italian solvent and chemical waste market amounted to approximately 375 thousand tons, with waste to purification accounting for 62% of the overall volume (approximately 230 thousand tons) while the remainder is treated for energy recovery. The Italian solvent and chemical waste market grew at a CAGR of 3.0% between 2010 and 2019 and was characterized by the increasing incidence of waste to purification volumes (from 60% in 2010 to 62% in 2019) on the back of a general trend favoring circular solutions as well as a clear price advantage over incineration for waste producers, especially for lower-water concentration solvents generating a higher yield. The projected growth of the Italian solvent and chemical waste market is underpinned by strong growth prospects in the underlying markets of industrial production (expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3.5% from 2019 to 2025) and particularly, API production (expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025), driven by: (i) projected demographic trends, such as an ageing population and an increasing incidence of chronic diseases, and (ii) API producers potentially reshoring operations that were previously outsourced to the Asia-Pacific region on account of regulatory constraints. Volumes of waste solvents that are recycled are expected to continue to outperform volumes of solvents sent to energy recovery (at a CAGR of 4.6% and 1.6%, 126 ----- respectively, between 2019 and 2025), sustained by the trends outlined above.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our top 20 customers (excluding CONOU) accounted for 23.6% of our revenue. Our customers include oil companies and blenders, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, including blue chip brands such as Eni, Total, Petronas, Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi. While all of our operating sites are located in Italy, we benefit from a global commercial reach, serving over 60 countries through a network of local distributors. We have a strong geographical footprint in Italy, especially in its Northern regions. We currently operate 12 waste storage sites and 13 waste treatment and recycling facilities, including four plants for industrial wastewater treatment, two plants for lubricant oil regeneration, two plants for purification and blending of solvents and five treatment and pre-treatment plants. We have approximately 800 full-time employees (accounting for the acquisition of Castiglia in July 2021). We offer our products and services through three business units: - **Environment. Our Environment business unit consists of an integrated platform offering a comprehensive range of environmental services, mostly in hazardous waste management and, to a lesser extent, in non-hazardous waste management covering a broad spectrum of the value chain, with an emphasis on recycling and recovery activities. Our Environment portfolio includes sustainable services and solutions for the industrial waste market such as (i) collection, transportation, first level treatment and storage, (ii) consulting services and laboratory analysis carried out through our network of ten accredited laboratories, (iii) industrial wastewater treatment and (iv) solid waste treatment. In addition, we offer complimentary services of commercial brokering and trading of hazardous and non-hazardous special waste. 129 ----- Our exposure to third-party-operated landfills and incinerators is limited, accounting for approximately 12% of the total volume of our end-of-waste destinations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Environment business unit were €143.5 million and €29.6 million, respectively, representing 35.3% and 34.8%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. - **Regeneration. Our Regeneration business unit benefits from over 50 years of experience in the production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process that transforms waste oil, a hazardous waste, into a valuable product. Our used oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano primarily produce regenerated lubricant bases and, to a lesser extent, diesel oil and other by-products. We believe that the high quality and price competitiveness of our regenerated lubricant bases (comparable to virgin oils), underpinned by our proprietary re-refining technology enabling the Group to process a wide spectrum of feedstock qualities, represents a strong competitive advantage over many of our competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Regeneration business unit were €117.8 million and €34.5 million, respectively, representing 29.0% and 40.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. - **Purification. Our Purification business unit comprises the production and sale of a variety of solvents derived both from the valorization of chemical waste, including thinners and solvents from waste (“SFW”), and virgin raw materials, including pure aliphatics. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Purification business unit were €144.8 million and €20.9 million, respectively, representing 35.7% and 24.6%, respectively, of our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. The following charts set forth our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA breakdown by business unit for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.

155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,837 ktons,18.7.1,"Front-runner in the circular economy solutions market, with distinctive competences in industrial hazardous waste recycling","We act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps for the industrial waste streams through our proprietary technologies and a strong network of partners for specific types of waste. We have a distinctive focus on recycling and regeneration activities that enable us to offer circular solutions underpinned by the use of recycled products as industrial inputs. Our integrated platform: (i) drives significant commercial synergies across our business units, particularly in relation to sale channels, distributions and technological solutions; (ii) reinforces our value proposition to customers by covering a broad spectrum of waste management services; (iii) enables vertical integration by securing a steady supply of waste; (iv) facilitates centralized procurement efforts and capital expenditure optimization; (v) reduces transportation costs through fleet and route optimization; and (vi) drives efficiencies in our operations through the sharing of proprietary technologies and best practices. In addition, our scale and organizational structure often give us a competitive advantage over smaller players who may experience difficulties complying with increasingly stringent regulations. This is particularly the case of regulations imposing strict obligations on waste producers in relation to the waste cycle from collection to end-of-waste destinations. In these instances, structured players like us are able to provide customers with enhanced regulatory certainty and reduced compliance risks. The graphic below sets out our positioning across the waste management value chain for each relevant industry. 131 ----- We are at the forefront of the circular economy model. The integrated nature of our platform and the circularity of our business model enable us to provide sustainable solutions across our three business units. Supported by strong technological and operational competencies, we are able to extract value out of industrial waste for the production of sustainable products and resources. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 88%, 95% and 95% of the waste we managed in the Environment, Regeneration and Purification business units, respectively, was transformed into products, returned to the environment as purified water or sent to energy recovery, resulting in an overall circularity index of approximately 90%. Over this period, (i) within our Environment business unit, 48% of the waste managed was sent to recovery, 27% of the waste managed underwent water treatment, 13% of the waste managed underwent oil emulsion treatment and 12% of the waste managed was sent to other destinations, (ii) within our Regeneration business unit, 66%, 14%, 8% and 7% of lubricant oils processed were used to produce lubricant bases, bitumen additives, water and gas oil, respectively, while we outsourced 4% and 1% of lubricant oils processed for disposal and recovery, respectively, and (iii) within our Purification business unit, 60%, 25% and 10% of industrial streams and virgin raw materials processed were used to produce SFW, pure solvents from virgin raw materials and purified water, respectively, while we outsourced 4% and 1% of the materials processed for disposal and recovery, respectively. The remaining portion of the waste is delivered to third-party landfill sites and incinerators. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 72% of waste collected was internally treated (including waste oil for our Regeneration business unit), 13% was internally pre-treated and 16% was collected for sorting and storage. Our Regeneration business solutions enable us to reduce the impact on the environment compared to primary production, resulting in a reduction of approximately 90% in the consumption of fossil fuel resources, an approximately 200% reduction in CO2 emissions, an approximately 400% reduction in emissions of fine dusts and an approximately 500% reduction in the emission of acidifying substances (NOx, SO2 and NH3), in each case as compared to primary production. Furthermore, our Purification business solutions significantly reduce the impact of solvent recycling compared to primary production, resulting in an approximately 1,000% reduction in CO2 emissions. In addition, our integrated platform enables us to benefit from solid and attractive market dynamics, leveraging upon the ongoing regulatory shift from a “linear economy” in favor of a “circular economy.” We benefit from favorable regulation within the EU and Italy on waste treatment and used oil regeneration. Further to the enactment of EU Directive 2008/98/EC (supplemented by EU Directive 2018/850), the EU required member states to significantly reduce waste disposal in favor of recycling, by establishing a specific waste management hierarchy. Italy implemented the EU-prescribed waste hierarchy through national legislation and set up a system of recycling authorizations, imposing stringent restrictions on authorized production capacity for special waste that has reinforced our market position by creating high entry barriers. In addition, these stringent regulatory requirements are enablers of our strong market position as waste producers are incentivized to rely on our advanced recycling and waste management solutions as a way of managing high compliance and regulatory costs relating to the disposal and treatment of industrial waste, including risks of economic penalties and criminal sanctions. The graphic below presents our advantageous position across the waste management hierarchy. 132 ----- Furthermore, our Regeneration business benefits from the favorable regulatory framework established in Italy, one of the most virtuous countries in Europe in terms of collection and regeneration of used oil, where regenerated lubricant oil accounted for 99% of collected volumes in Italy in 2019, compared to an average of 51% in the EU over the same period. We benefit from incentive mechanisms established by CONOU (Consorzio _nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e trattamento degli oli minerali usati), a private Italian consortium, to support_ our Regeneration business. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lubricant oil market price and vice versa, although in no event, such as instances of high lubricant oil market prices, does the incentive mechanism require us to pay a regeneration treatment fee to CONOU), ensures that we have downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lubricant oil prices and supports a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products, under normal circumstances. This framework has been in place for over ten years and has also been subject to modifications favorable for oil regeneration companies over the years to better reflect market dynamics and support collection and regeneration activities. In particular, based on the latest amendment in October 2020, the regeneration treatment fee is no longer subject to a set cap that historically limited the amount of compensation granted to oil regeneration companies during periods of significantly low oil prices, such as in the first halves of 2016 and 2020; therefore supporting a profitability floor even in significantly unfavorable oil price scenarios. We expect that further amendments to the formula may only be effective after December 2024, except in exceptional circumstances indicated in the CONOU Operating Regulation which, in any event, cannot be retroactive. We estimate that the removal of the set cap as well as other amendments to the formula, on a pro forma basis for the year 2020, would have had an estimated positive impact of €1.9 million on our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020. The quality and breadth of our role as a circular economy player enabled us to achieve a strong market position in Italy, where we managed approximately 6% of the total volume of hazardous waste through our Environment business unit for the year ended December 31, 2019. Given the highly fragmented nature of the hazardous waste management market in Italy, we were the second largest company by volume over the same period, with the leading company accounting for approximately 7% of the total volume of hazardous waste. In addition, we are the number one player in the Italian oil regeneration space, with an approximately 89% market share as of December 31, 2019, and a market leader in Europe in terms of oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output in 2019. We are also the leading company in the Italian waste solvent purification space, with a 50% market share by revenue, and the largest European player by capacity in 2019, with an approximately 37% share of the Italian market.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,837 ktons,18.7.2,"Leadership position in defensive and profitable markets, benefiting from high entry barriers","We operate in markets characterized by high barriers to entry. The industrial hazardous waste market in Italy accounted for approximately 9.9 million tons in 2019 and benefits from higher barriers to entry compared to industrial non-hazardous waste and urban waste due to strict regulatory approvals and more advanced technical skills required for the waste management processes. Supported by these features, the industrial hazardous waste market in Italy has shown profitability and resiliency during periods of economic difficulties, recording a CAGR of approximately 1.3% over the period 2010-2014, compared to a negative CAGR of 2.2% and a CAGR of 0.2% during the same period for the Italian urban waste market and non-hazardous waste market, respectively, and a negative CAGR registered by the Italian GDP over the same period. The resilience of our business in a challenging macro-economic environment was also displayed by our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 when despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue remained relatively flat as compared to 2019, on a like-for-like basis. Leveraging upon our strong and strategic local presence, especially in the most industrialized areas of Italy, we believe that our Environment business unit is advantageously positioned as a one-stop shop for producers of hazardous waste, alongside our Regeneration and Purification business units. We believe that our longstanding experience with hazardous waste, highly skilled staff and advanced waste management plants give us a strong competitive advantage over national competitors. In addition, the complexity of the authorization, certification, compliance and operational requirements in the waste management industry (especially with regard to the hazardous waste market), along with our geographical proximity to customers, also serve as natural barriers to entry. Through our Regeneration business unit, we hold a market leading position in Italy. We held approximately 89% of the market share of the Italian oil regeneration market by volume in 2019, and we are a leading company in Europe in terms of oil regeneration volumes, with a 15% market share measured by maximum regenerated lubricant oil output in 2019. We believe that our economies of scale, proprietary technologies and contracted 133 ----- waste streams, also in light of the CONOU framework, provide us with a strong competitive advantage. Furthermore, the Italian used oil regeneration market requires significant upfront investment and is also characterized by complex authorization, certification and operational requirements, which serve as additional barriers to entry. Our Purification business has the largest installed capacity in the European waste solvent purification industry, at approximately 100 thousand tons per year, and we held 50% of the market share of the Italian waste solvent purification market by revenue in 2019. Reinforced by our circular partnership and established relationships with leading players in the pharmaceutical sector, we have also built strong positions in international end-markets, including leading positions in the waste-based thinner segments in Africa and the Middle East (with a market share of 38% and 37% by volumes, respectively, in 2019) and in the pure aliphatics segment in Europe (with a 34% market share in 2019). We believe that our economies of scale, know-how, proprietary technologies and long-term partnerships with a loyal customer base have enabled our Purification business unit to secure and maintain market leading positions in Italy and Europe. In addition, the Italian solvent purification market is characterized by high barriers to entry, underpinned by requirements for significant upfront investment and the complexity of the authorization, certification, compliance and operational processes. We believe our competitors’ limited ability to replicate our business model also resides in our advanced R&D capabilities across our business units. Over the years, we have internalized value-adding processes, and developed products and waste treatment methods in partnership with our customers. This has created an intangible barrier, which does not solely rely on commercial relationships, but on years of expertise matured in close collaboration with our customers (such as, for example, our collaboration with API producers for the joint development of formulas for waste optimization in our Purification business unit). Furthermore, our ability to produce high-purity aliphatic solvents from virgin materials, combined with our trading activities relating to these products, allows us to establish increasingly solid and synergistic relationships with our customers and present our Purification business unit as a one-stop shop for high-purity aliphatic solvents. Our Purification business unit benefits from an authorized capacity for the production of non-waste finished products, such as virgin materials, of additional 100 thousand tons per year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Our strong geographical footprint and the density of our operational network in Northern Italy, especially in the Northern regions of Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna, allow us to benefit from economies of scale in managing complex logistics and the input sourcing reach of our production. These factors also improve our efficiency by minimizing the logistical burden and costs of transporting our raw materials to our facilities. In addition, our wide-reaching asset base enables geographical proximity to our customer base and ensures extensive coverage of the Italian market. Set forth below is a chart representing the location of our waste management sites as of June 30, 2021. 134 ----- We also operate two stand-alone laboratories for chemical and environmental analysis. Supported by a network of 18 waste management companies, our Environment business has an overall authorized capacity of approximately 900 thousand tons per year. Approximately 559 thousand tons of waste were processed through the waste storage and treatment plants of our Environment business unit for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, while additional 338 thousand tons were sold through the trading activities of our Environment business unit during the same period. Underpinned by over 50 years of experience in the production of quality lubricating bases through a proprietary re-refining process, our Regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano have a combined treatment capacity of 214 thousand tons per year. Approximately 184 thousand tons of used oil were processed through our oil regeneration plants for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021. Our Purification business unit comprises two plants for purification and blending of solvents with an authorized capacity of 99 thousand tons per year for solvent and chemical purification deriving from waste, 100 thousand tons per year for solvent purification (e.g., for virgin materials) and chemical synthesis and 75 thousand tons per year for our blending plant in Rho, near Milan. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we treated 94 thousand tons for solvent and chemical purification deriving from waste (of which 57 thousand tons were subsequently blended and packed in our blending plant as well) and we treated 38 thousand tons for solvent purification (e.g., for virgin materials) and chemical synthesis. In connection with our waste management operations, we also own and maintain a fleet of more than 120 collection trucks and other industrial vehicles. Our fleet helps secure the waste we collect, allows us to adapt to individual client needs, improves our service offering and makes regulatory compliance easier, particularly regarding the different transportation requirements for specific types of waste. Our state-of-the-art plants, extensive chemical know-how, designed industrial processes and proprietary technologies, underpinned by 14 registered patents, allow us to act as a one-stop shop across all value chain steps for industrial waste streams. Our Regeneration business benefits from a patented proprietary process for the productions of lubricant bases, which is now widely used by leading lubrication companies worldwide.

The solid relationships with our clients, their end-market diversification, along with the pricing stability levers inherent in our business, have allowed us to build a resilient business model with high visibility over revenue and profitability performance and operating cash generation. Anticipated structural growth in our end-markets (with an estimated CAGR of approximately 7% in the Italian hazardous waste market over the period 2021-2025), supported by structural imbalance between demand and supply, high switching costs for our customers and our entrenched presence in the most densely industrialized regions of Italy, are expected to generate premium economics in our business units. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lubricant oil (i.e., the fee increases upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), provides our Regeneration segment with downside protection against periods of low prices of crude oil and lubricant oil and supports a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products. The chart below shows the resilience of our Regeneration business unit despite fluctuations of oil prices over the period 2018-2020. Since 2018, we have achieved revenue and profitability growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions.

CONOU is a private Italian consortium established in 1984 to promote and support 143 ----- waste oil collection and regeneration activities in Italy. Today, CONOU has relations with over sixty used oil collectors and has set up an incentive mechanism paid to oil regeneration companies, the CONOU regeneration treatment fee, which is inversely correlated to the market price of lube oil (i.e. the fee increases upon a decrease in lube oil market price and vice versa), thus ensuring that Itelyum and other players in the regeneration industry are granted certain downside protection against fluctuations of crude oil and lube oil prices. The CONOU regeneration treatment fee is paid to oil regeneration companies on a monthly basis based on the volumes of regenerated oil bases produced and is calculated based on the ICIS average price of lube oil recorded during the preceding quarter. The regeneration treatment fee granted by CONOU sustains the circularity in all the phases of the waste oil economic cycle and permits us to offset the cyclical decrease in oil price by guaranteeing a minimum profitability threshold in the sale of our oil-based products; therefore strengthen the resilience of our Regeneration business unit vis-a-vis fluctuations in oil price. See also “Industry” and “Regulation.” For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the CONOU regeneration treatment fee accounted for 25.8% of revenue from our Regeneration activities for the period.

Our oil regeneration plants in Pieve Fissiraga and Ceccano and the Landriano solvent purification plant consume both thermal and electrical energy. In all three plants, electricity demand is largely supported by high-efficiency cogeneration. In our Environment business unit, we primarily use electricity purchased from the grid and fuel for our fleet. In order to partially offset our energy consumption, we own and operate three photovoltaic fields, for a total installed power of over 800 kW, which self-produce and inject electricity into the grid. Our plants in Pieve Fissiraga, Ceccano and Landriano fall within the scope of the European Emission Trading System, partly benefiting from free CO2 allocations, and are therefore subjected to specific environmental accounting rules and third-party verification. The combination of optimization initiatives implemented in the most energy intensive sites ensure specific consumption and carbon intensity in line with the best practices of the sector. In addition, fleets of managed vehicles generate emissions in proportion to the mileage and the type of fleet in circulation. Our most significant emissions are subject to periodic measurement campaigns and, in some cases, are covered by continuous monitoring systems of the main emission parameters. In addition, the production of lube bases and solvents by recycling industrial wastes permits to avoid significant quantities of CO2 when compared to production processes from virgin resources. At our operating sites, we use water resources to meet our supply needs for drinking and civil use (e.g., canteens) or for industrial use. Our industrial cycle is managed in a closed circuit as much as possible. In all sites, discharges of industrial or meteoric waters, both in surface water streams or sewages, are equipped with modern treatment systems that guarantee the full environmental quality of wastewater. In four of our sites, hydraulic barrier systems are active, aimed at reducing pre-existing contamination of soils and aquifers.

See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Potential liabilities, costs and reputational _impacts from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”_ We have briefly summarized below two of these proceedings, which relate to health and safety related matters. In particular, two criminal proceedings for, among other things, alleged culpable injuries pursuant to the applicable Italian Criminal and health and safety law provisions, are currently pending against the former 153 ----- technical director (direttore tecnico) and sole director of Castiglia and a manager of Itelyum Regeneration. These two proceedings relate to different accidents which resulted in serious personal injuries for one of our employees (in respect of the proceeding against the manager of Castiglia) and for one employee of a third-party company providing on-site services for us (in respect of the proceeding against the manager of Itelyum Regeneration). These accidents were allegedly associated with the violation of applicable Italian workplace health and safety regulations. No final and binding (i.e., non-appealable) decision has been issued as of the date of this Offering Memorandum in relation to these proceedings. The proceeding against the manager of Castiglia is pending against such individual in his role as former legal representative of Castiglia and it was initiated by the relevant prosecutors as a result of an accident relating to an employee of Castiglia, who suffered in 2017 serious personal injuries at the premises of certain customers of Castiglia. Moreover, in June 2021, the abovementioned former legal representative of Castiglia was sentenced to one and a half months of imprisonment after a final and binding (i.e., non-appealable) ruling issued against him in his position as former legal representative of Castiglia by the Italian Supreme Court (corte di cassazione) for, among other things, culpable injuries in relation to another accident occurred in 2014 to another employee of Castiglia, who suffered serious personal injuries during operations carried out at Castiglia premises. Said former legal representative of Castiglia is currently a manager of Castiglia but no longer has delegation of powers, nor does he operate as a technical director (direttore tecnico) of Castiglia. The proceeding against the manager of Itelyum Regeneration was initiated against such individual in his role as supervisor of health and safety standards compliance for Itelyum Regeneration, and relates to an accident which occurred in 2018 at a site managed by Viscolube S.r.l. (now Itelyum Regeneration). In particular, an employee of a third-party company providing on-site services to Itelyum Regeneration was severely injured during certain oil discharge operations. In terms of potential consequences for the Group, while neither Castiglia nor Itelyum Regeneration is itself party to any criminal proceeding in relation to these accidents as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, these alleged violations may potentially lead to an assertion of criminal liability for Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001. If Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration were to be involved in a proceeding under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, a potential conviction of either company could result in, among other things, sanctions and penalties, civil and administrative fines, operational bans (including on a precautionary basis) being imposed on it. Moreover, according to general principles of Italian administrative law, the alleged health and safety violations and associated proceedings, besides needing to be mandatorily disclosed to the relevant public tendering authorities in the context of the public tender procedures to which Castiglia and Itelyum Regeneration take part pursuant to applicable Italian regulations, could also, irrespective of any potential liability under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, result in the disqualification of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, from future or ongoing tender processes for the awarding of contracts with public entities (both upon a discretional assessment by the competent public contracting authority or upon a decision by an administrative court following a claim by competitors of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, on a case by case basis, and as a general and automatic effect), in particular in the event of a final and binding conviction (i.e. non-appealable) of the manager of Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable. In addition, as well as the one that occurred in 2014 mentioned above in relation to which a final and binding conviction verdict was issued in June 2021 against the former technical and sole director of Castiglia, these alleged violations could potentially trigger the termination of certain ongoing contracts to which Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration, as applicable, is party with public entities, as well as the enforcement of any bid or performance bond provided by Castiglia or Itelyum Regeneration to the relevant public contracting entities, where applicable. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Potential liabilities, costs and reputational impacts _from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”_ Although our potential ultimate legal and financial liabilities with respect to such proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty, based on information available as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and taking into account, among others, the following elements, we do not believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings, individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations: (i) while health and safety legislation provisions could potentially trigger administrative liability for us under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, none of these criminal proceedings against individuals is accompanied by a proceeding against us under Legislative Decree No. 231/2001; (ii) certain remediation actions to strengthen health and safety standards and related compliance procedures have already been implemented by each of Castiglia and Itelyum Regeneration following the accidents at issue and, in this respect, the applicable case law and statutory laws provide that any such 154 ----- internal measures aimed at minimizing the possibility of further health and safety violations may be taken into account by the competent courts and authorities, thereby avoiding or mitigating potential sanctions, including any applicable operational ban or exclusion (so called “Self-Cleaning Measures”); (iii) as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, neither Castiglia nor Itelyum Regeneration has suffered any material negative consequences (including from a legal, business and reputational standpoint) as a result of the abovementioned accidents and the related proceedings; (iv) Itelyum Regeneration does not have any material contracts with public contracting authority following a public tender process, therefore potential disqualification or contract termination risks appear to be remote and/or not applicable; and (v) as far as the proceeding against the manager of Castiglia is concerned, we have obtained indemnification protections in the contractual documentation relating to the acquisition of such business in July 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The Waste Framework Directive has been lastly modified by EU directive 2018/851. The Waste Framework Directive was adopted on November 19, 2008, and entered into force on December 12, 2010, replacing the previous directive 2006/12/EC on waste and directives 75/439/EEC and 91/689/EEC on waste oils and hazardous waste, respectively. The Waste Framework Directive sets forth the basic waste management requirements for EU member States and establishes a hierarchy in the waste treatment, from disposal prevention, through preparing for-reuse, recycling and recovery up to disposal (as last resort). In addition to the Waste Framework Directive, there are specific regulations relating to peculiar waste deriving, for instance, from batteries and accumulators, electric and electronic devices, end-of-life vehicles and products’ packaging. Furthermore, with the aim to reduce the use of single-use plastics, the EU directive 2019/904 has been introduced. In July 2014, the European Commission has published the so-called “waste package,” aimed at amending several EU directives (i.e., four directives, all amended on May 30, 2018) and at introducing new waste targets, with the focus on resource efficiency and circular economy. The main elements of the “waste package” include, inter alia, at national levels: (i) the recycling and preparing for reuse of municipal waste to be increased to 60% by 2030; (ii) the recycling and preparing for reuse of packaging waste to be increased to 70% by the end of 2030. Such global 70% target shall include materialspecific targets (i.e., to reach 85% for paper and 55% for plastic, 80% for ferrous metals; 60% for aluminum and 75% for glass by the end of 2030 and other targets by the end of 2025); (iii) phasing out landfilling by 2035 for recyclable (including plastic, paper, metals, glass and bio-waste) waste in non-hazardous waste landfills, corresponding to a maximum landfilling rate of 25% or (iv) measures aimed at reducing food waste generation by 50% by 2030. EU member States are required to implement legislative measures in order to reinforce the waste treatment hierarchy, by regulating, inter alia, the principles of: - waste management responsibility (i.e., waste producers are responsible for the disposal or treatment of their own waste or for using a waste services provider authorized by the competent authorities to treat their waste); - extended producer’s responsibility (e.g., producers recover products, collect waste arising from selected products or accept returned products). The extended producer’s responsibility is mandatory for end-of-life vehicles, batteries and electronic/electric waste and it will be mandatory for waste deriving from packaging in 2025; - “polluter pays” (i.e., the costs of disposing of waste must be borne by the waste holder, by previous holders or by the producers of the products originating the waste); 156 ----- - self-sufficiency (i.e., EU member states shall create an adequate network of waste disposal installations and recovery installations); - proximity (i.e., waste disposed/recovered in the nearest appropriate installations); - prevention promotion (i.e., EU member states shall promote the prevention of waste production through the development of clean technologies as well as the reuse and recycling of materials).",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Waste is classified, according to its origin, into municipal waste and special waste and, according to its characteristics, into hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Additionally, following the latest amendments (reference is made to Legislative Decree no. 116 of September 3, 2020) to the Environmental Code, waste can be classified as “deriving from construction works,” food waste and organic waste. The legislation applicable to the waste depends on said classifications. Depending on the type of waste and on the activity carried out in connection with the waste, the Environmental Code requires the producers or holders of waste to carry out the treatment of waste themselves or to have the treatment and/or the collection and transportation handled by an authorized third party or arranged by a public collector under a special agreement. The waste produced is traced through an integrated system which provides for a national register where information about the waste management - by means of registers relating to the operations of waste loading and unloading and waste forms reporting the whole transportation of waste - is reported. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may fail to obtain, renew, or comply with the terms of _the licenses, authorizations and permits required for our operations, and development or operation of our waste management facilities may be slowed or interrupted due to administrative law and rules and conditions imposed by local governments.”_ (ii) Waste treatment - operating permits The implementation and management of plants for disposal or recovery of waste, including hazardous waste, is subject to the obtainment of a single operating permit (Autorizzazione unica per i nuovi impianti di smaltimento e _di recupero dei rifiuti), issued by the competent authority, where all the obligations and characteristics of the_ plants are listed. The single operating permit, for plants having certain characteristics requested by the Environmental Code, may be substituted by the integrated environmental authorization (Autorizzazione Integrata _Ambientale)._ Furthermore, in order to carry out the activities of collection, transportation and/or sale of waste, the enrolment with the national register of waste managers (Albo nazionale gestori ambientali) is mandatory. Pursuant to national legislation - implementing the WEEE, ELV and Batteries Directives - applicable to waste from electrical and electronical equipment, end-of-life vehicles, batteries and accumulators, the treatment of such special waste is subject to obtainment of the above-mentioned single permit. (iii) Waste non-compliance – sanctions Failure to comply with the legislation applicable to waste, both in relation to the treatment operations (e.g., collection, transportation, recovery and/or disposal) and in relation to the obligations to obtain the relevant authorizations or to be enrolled with the specific registers/consortia, may entail the application of administrative and/or criminal monetary sanctions (up to €45.0 thousand) or, in the worst-case scenario, other criminal sanctions (imprisonment up to eight years). (iv) Contamination events The detection of potential polluting substances in environmental matrixes (i.e., soil and/or groundwater) entails that the polluter adopts, in the following 24 hours, the necessary prevention measures and communicates the 159 ----- detected potential contamination to the competent authorities. The person responsible of the contamination, once adopted the first prevention measures, has to carry out preliminary investigations on the polluting events and, should the contamination thresholds provided for by applicable legislation be exceeded, has to start an administrative procedure in front of the competent authorities which may consist of a remediation procedure (or alternative measures ordered by the environmental authorities). Should the contamination be caused by hazardous waste, criminal monetary sanctions (up to €52.0 thousand) or, in the worst-case scenario, other criminal sanctions (imprisonment up to two years) would apply. (v) National Consortium for the management, collection and treatment of Used Oils In order to organize the management of used oils, which must be mandatorily regenerated, the companies which produce oils (also following regeneration), collect and recover used oils or substitute and sell lubricants, must enroll with the “National Consortium for the management, collection and treatment of Used Oils” (Consorzio _nazionale per la gestione, raccolta e trattamento degli oli minerali usati, the “CONOU”)._ The CONOU aims - inter alia - at promoting public awareness of collection issues, ensuring and encourage collection of used oils, directly carrying out collection of used oils from holders who request it, transferring the used oils collected. The functions of the CONOU may be directly carried out by third parties operating in certain sectors, specifically entitled, by virtue of a power of attorney granted by the CONOU, to do so. The participation to the consortium entails the compliance with all the obligations deriving from the CONOU’s regulation, including payment obligations in connection with the membership in the CONOU itself. Nonetheless, the consortium has established an incentive mechanism, according to which CONOU’s members operating in the regeneration industry are granted a regeneration treatment fee for the regeneration of waste oils. (vi) National consortium for the collection and treatment of spent lead batteries and lead waste The national consortium for the collection and treatment of spent lead batteries and lead waste (Consorzio _Nazionale per la raccolta dei rifiuti di pile e batterie, the “COBAT”) is a collection and treatment system for_ spent lead batteries and lead waste. COBAT grants an efficient service or the collection, storage and start-up for recycling of any type of waste and offers companies a wide range of services that enhance and support their choice to be protagonists of the circular economy.

(b) The Transaction Security will, subject to any requirements of applicable law, be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all in cash) for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall; or (ii) sufficient proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when 181 ----- the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Super Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise). (c) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any requirements of applicable law, the time frame for the realization of value from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant to Enforcement will be determined by the Instructing Group provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective. (d) On a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security, the Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement is made pursuant to a public auction or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Principles and maximize recovery of any such Enforcement Action, (B) that the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. Such Financial Advisor shall be selected by the Instructing Group giving any enforcement instructions to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent shall be directed to appoint such Financial Adviser in any such enforcement instruction. (e) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement and it has received instructions as to the identity of such Financial Advisor from the Instructing Group. The liability of any Financial Advisor in respect of the opinions referred to in paragraph (d) above may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement. (f) The Financial Advisor’s opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met and the Security Agent shall not be liable to any party as a result of having acted on the basis of the instructions given to it by the Instructing Group, as opined on by the Financial Advisor. (g) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction, any equity investors of the Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction. There is no requirement in the Security Enforcement Principles that requires the Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction. (h) In the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective. (i) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance with this Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above has been met. For the avoidance of doubt, the above provisions do not apply to the enforcement of the Senior Notes Only Security. _Turnover_ The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Super Senior Creditor, Cash Management Facility Creditor, Super Senior Hedging Lender, Senior Secured Creditor, Future Pari Passu Creditor, Future Senior Creditor or Future Second Lien Creditor receives or recovers the proceeds of any Enforcement of Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency event) or any Senior Notes Only Security not permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or applied other than in accordance with Payments Waterfall that it shall (subject to certain prior actual knowledge qualifications in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and any Future Senior Debt Representative, as applicable): - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities of that creditor (or, if less, the amount received or 182 ----- recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount or an amount equal to that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and to certain significant limitations under Italian law, the Issuer (or MergerCo, as applicable) shall use commercially 198 ----- reasonable efforts to procure that, no later than 90 days from the earlier of (i) the Post Completion Merger and (ii) in the event the Post Completion Merger does not occur, the date falling fifteen months after the Completion Date (the “Cut-Off Date”), Itelyum Purification and, to the extent the Post Completion Merger does not occur, Itelyum Regeneration will each guarantee the Notes. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification accounted for 29.0% and 35.7% of the Target Group’s revenue and 40.6% and 24.3% of the Target Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (net of intercompany flows), respectively. In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility, Public Debt or certain other Indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the purposes of this “Description of Notes,” “Guarantor” means Itelyum Regeneration, Itelyum Purification and any other Restricted Subsidiary that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture after the Completion Date (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto). The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by each relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral.” The Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that will_ apply to, and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes, which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. The Issuer is a holding company established in connection with the Transactions with no revenue generating operations of its own. As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will not have any Subsidiaries. Following the Completion Date, substantially all of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries. As a result, prior to the Post Completion Merger, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends and other payments from its Subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its outstanding indebtedness service (including under the Notes) and other obligations, and such dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing our indebtedness, including any financing agreements of our Subsidiaries. Our Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to Our Structure and the Financing—The _Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and prior to the Post Completion Merger will depend exclusively on cash from the operating companies of the Target Group to be able to make payments on the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—We may be unable to complete the Post Completion Merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all.”_ Not all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks 199 ----- _Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of all of the Issuer’s (or MergerCo’s) subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.” Prior to the granting of the Guarantees by the Guarantors, the Notes will be structurally_ subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Target, Itelyum Regeneration and Itelyum Purification. After the granting of the Guarantee by the Guarantors (and subject to the limitations thereon), the Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Notes. As of June 30, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s (or MergerCo’s, as applicable) subsidiaries which are not expected to guarantee the Notes would have had €11.6 million in outstanding financial debt, €2.8 million of which was secured, which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date in a newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer or repurchase any Notes as described under this heading “—Change of Control” upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption with respect to the Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as defined under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. 216 ----- The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including financial resources of its Restricted Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuer may not be able to _repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset disposition offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the holders of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed 245 ----- in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

For purposes of this “Description of Notes,” “Issuer” means Verde Bidco S.p.A.

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer. Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will not control the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target nor any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of Notes.” As such, the Issuer cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of and from the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date. If the Completion Date is anticipated to occur more than one business day after the Issue Date, pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of this Offering of the Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed (the “Escrow Agreement”), to be dated the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee and Bank of America, National Association, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”).

The Global Notes will each bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements as discussed in _“Transfer Restrictions.”_ Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of BookEntry Interests. In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

The Issuer and the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and we urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: _Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and_ settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. _Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect_ participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry 291 ----- Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant BookEntry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 292 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, Interest relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017, as subsequently amended and supplemented and/or in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 124, as subsequently amended and supplemented. _Application of the imposta sostitutiva_ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, brokerage companies (società di _intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio (“SGR”),_ stockbrokers and other entities identified by decrees of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (each, an “Intermediary”). An Intermediary must: (a) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary; and (b) participate, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. If the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the relevant Italian financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary) paying the Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due. 298 ----- _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ If the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident for tax purposes (without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected), an exemption from the imposta sostitutiva applies, provided that the non-Italian resident Noteholder is: (a) a beneficial owner of the payment of Interest and resident, for tax purposes, in a state or territory included in the White List; or (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of establishment; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must promptly deposit the Notes together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or indirectly with: (i) an Italian or non-Italian resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the bank or financial institution to be an EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as defined below); or (ii) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct relationships, via telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (the “Second Level Bank”). Organizations and companies that are not resident of Italy, acting through a system of centralized administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (which include Euroclear and Clearstream) are treated as Second Level Banks, provided that they appoint an Italian representative (an Italian resident bank or SIM, or the permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM, or a central depositary of financial instruments pursuant to Article 80 of Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998) for the purposes of the application of Decree No. 239. If a non-Italian resident Noteholder deposits the Notes directly with a Second Level Bank, the latter shall be treated both as a First Level Bank and a Second Level Bank. The exemption from the imposta sostitutiva for non-Italian resident Noteholders is conditional upon: (i) the deposit of the Notes, either directly or indirectly, with an institution which qualifies as a Second Level Bank; and (ii) the submission to the First Level Bank or the Second Level Bank (as the case may be) of a statement of the relevant Noteholder (autocertificazione), to be provided only once, in which it declares, inter alia, that it is eligible to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva. Such statement must comply with the requirements set forth by a Ministerial Decree dated December 12, 2001, is valid until withdrawn or revoked (unless some information provided therein has changed) and does not need to be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document for the same or equivalent purposes was previously submitted to the same depository. The above statement is not required for non-Italian resident investors that are international bodies or entities set up in accordance with international agreements entered into force in Italy referred to in point b) above or Central Banks or entities also authorized to manage the official reserves of a State referred to in point d) above.

Where an Italian-resident Noteholder is an individual not_ engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, any capital gain realized by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be subject to a capital gain tax (“CGT”) levied at a rate of 26%. Noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains. In respect of the application of CGT, taxpayers may opt-under certain conditions-for any of the three regimes described below. _Tax return regime (Regime della dichiarazione). Under the tax return regime, which is the default regime for_ Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss) realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss, in their annual tax return, and pay the CGT on such gains, together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Within the same time limit, capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. _Nondiscretionary investment portfolio regime (risparmio amministrato regime). As an alternative to the tax_ return regime, Italian-resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (regime del risparmio amministrato). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: - the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediaries (including permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediaries); and - an express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in a timely fashion by the relevant Noteholder. The depository must account for the CGT in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the CGT to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption or certain other transfer of the Notes may be deducted from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years, up until the fourth tax year. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains/losses realized within said regime in the annual tax return. _Discretionary investment portfolio regime (risparmio gestito regime). In the risparmio gestito regime, any capital_ gains realized by Italian-resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at the tax year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. Under the _risparmio gestito regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized within said_ regime in its annual tax return. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26% CGT) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30,1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017, as subsequently amended and supplemented and/or in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 124, as subsequently amended and supplemented. According to Article 1 (219-225) of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, under some conditions, capital losses realized by Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity upon sale or redemption of the Notes if the Notes are included in 300 ----- certain long-term savings accounts (piani di risparmio a lungo termine) governed by Decree No. 124 that meet specific requirements, give rise to a tax credit equal to the capital losses, provided that such tax credit does not exceed the 20% of the amount invested in the long-term saving accounts (piani di risparmio a lungo termine). _Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_ Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes will be treated as part of taxable business income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the production for IRAP purposes), if realized by an Italian company, a similar commercial entity (including the Italian permanent establishment of non-Italian resident entities to which the Notes are connected) or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected. _Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian real estate investment fund or an Italian real estate SICAF will be subject neither to CGT nor to any income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or the Real Estate SICAF (see “Tax treatment of interest—Real estate investment funds and real estate _SICAFs”). However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income_ realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. _Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is a Fund, a SICAF (other than a real estate SICAF) or a SICAV will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant fiscal year. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the SICAF or the SICAV, but income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units / shares may be subject to a withholding tax of 26%. _Pension funds_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Finance Act 2017, as subsequently amended and supplemented and/or in Article 13-bis of Decree No. 124, as subsequently amended and supplemented. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ A 26% CGT on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized on the sale or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However, under Article 23(1)(f)(2) of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also certain multilateral trading facilities) in Italy or abroad are not subject to the CGT, subject to the filing of required documentation in a timely fashion (in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes and has no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected). Capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer, even if the Notes are not traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), are not subject to the CGT, provided that the beneficial owner is: (a) a resident, for tax purposes, of a state or territory included in the White List; or 301 ----- (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of establishment; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set forth above to benefit from the exemption from the imposta sostitutiva in accordance with Decree No. 239 (see “—Tax _treatment of interest”)._ If none of the above conditions is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or the redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), may be subject to the CGT at the current rate of 26%. However, Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the State where the recipient is tax resident, subject to certain conditions to be satisfied. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents Noteholders file in time with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax authorities of their country of residence. The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

It is possible that the IRS could assert that the payment of such excess amounts is a “contingent payment,” and that the Notes are therefore contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the applicable Treasury Regulations, however, for purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument, remote or incidental contingencies (determined as of the date the notes are issued) are ignored. The Issuer believes that the possibility of making additional payments is, in the 305 ----- aggregate, remote and/or incidental, and that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate different than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder. The cost of a Note purchased with euro generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. holder receives euro on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such euro by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of euro exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. 307 ----- Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). U.S. holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.

This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities or arrangements and investors therein, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity 304 ----- taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws. _Transactions related to the Acquisition_ If the conditions for the Post Completion Merger are met, it is expected that the Issuer and the Target will merge with Itelyum Regeneration, with MergerCo being the surviving entity. MergerCo, as the surviving entity, will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Post Completion Merger.” Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to do so) that these transactions will not constitute a significant modification of the Notes and therefore will not be treated as resulting in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view, and seek to treat the Post Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligations under the Notes by MergerCo as resulting in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such a position were taken and sustained, if the fair market value of the Notes at the time of the Post Completion Merger is less than the principal amount of the “new” Notes (by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount), such Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, U.S. holders may recognize gain in connection with such deemed exchange (although any loss could be disallowed) and would have a new holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the Acquisition and the Post Completion Merger. The balance of the discussion below assumes that the Post Completion Merger and the assumption of the obligation under the Notes by MergerCo will not be treated as a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The Initial Purchasers are BofA Securities Europe SA, Credit Suisse Bank (Europe), S.A., Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. and UniCredit Bank AG. Sales in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased. If an Initial Purchaser defaults, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer and it will not effect any offers or sales of any Notes in the United States unless such sale is through one or more U.S. registered broker dealers. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer will not, for a period of 60 days after the Closing Date, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except the Notes and the Guarantees thereof, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes without the prior written consent of the representative under the Purchase Agreement. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the issue price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that: - The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements; and - During the initial distribution of the Notes, it will offer or sell Notes only to persons they reasonably believe to be QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to the Issuer; - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; - to the extent it is also a “Manufacturer,” as defined in MiFID II, it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the European Economic Area in compliance with the applicable provisions of MiFID II, the Insurance Distribution Directive or the Prospectus Regulation relating to the offer and sale of securities to retail investors; and 309 ----- - to the extent it is also a “Manufacturer,” as defined in UK MiFIR, it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the UK in compliance with the applicable provisions of UK MiFIR, FSMA or the UK Prospectus Regulation relating to the offer and sale of securities to retail investors. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any securities to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes (i) in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes and (ii) in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date as specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being herein referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer _Restrictions.” Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock_ Exchange and to have the Notes admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be accepted or maintained. 310 ----- The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes or that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. If the Stabilizing Manager engages in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, it may discontinue them at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, provide currently and may provide in the future, commercial lending and banking, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuer, the Target and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees, commissions and expenses. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will also act as mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. In addition, each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have committed to provide bridge loan financing in respect of the Transactions in the event the Offering is not consummated, and such entities will receive customary fees in respect thereof. In addition, a portion of the proceeds from the Offering will be used to repay the Existing Itelyum Debt. Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (or its affiliates) was a lender under the facilities agreements constituting the Existing Itelyum Debt and received customary fees, commissions and expenses in connection therewith. Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own account. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer’s affiliates (including the Notes). Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer may hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchaser and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. The Initial Purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer and no one else in connection with the Offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. They will not regard any other person (whether or not a recipient of this Offering Memorandum) as their client in relation to the offering of Notes contemplated by this Offering Memorandum and will not be responsible to anyone for providing the protections afforded to a client nor giving advice in relation to the Offering or any transaction or arrangement referred to herein. 311 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the centre of the company’s operations. If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in 315 ----- the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of 316 ----- the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. 320 ----- In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante _comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_ appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. 321 ----- However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) during the period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the so-called “equitable subordination” rule.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian insolvency law considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; 322 ----- - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/ shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a 323 ----- declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.2,Italy,256.2.9,Certain Italian insolvency law considerations,"The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have recently been substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, _inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” hereinafter the “Insolvency_",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.3,"Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38-Suppl.",256.3.1,,"Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code; (iv) the adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been currently postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020 (“Liquidity",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.4,"Decree”), converted into law on June 5, 2020 no. 40. Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be",256.4.1,preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;,"333 ----- (vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and (vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo _patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by_ the creditor against the third party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese _in stato di insolvenza)._ The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure.” To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases-a judicial phase and an administrative phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario _giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization._ The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt. 334 ----- _Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the “Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. _Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee_ (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up. _Interim financing_ The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilita) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_ expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status (prededucibilita) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato _preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_ expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status. 335 ----- _Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_ In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis -a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. 336 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be",256.4.2,,"governed by Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), as in force before. Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, the most recent reforms that have been implemented by the Italian government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree 83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132 of August 6, 2015, effective August 21, 2015 and (ii) the amendments implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016. 324 ----- The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. _Restructuring outside of a judicial process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. 325 ----- _Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debts outstanding, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court (omologazione), in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial 326 ----- indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith and (ii) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-participating financial creditors have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from block restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within 30 days of receipt of the application. In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing). Financing granted in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called _prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_ company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. 327 ----- _Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato _preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the_ date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato _preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors._ The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuity aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides that the debtor company which has been granted such extension by the Court, can, before the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days, even if it has been filed an appeal for a declaration of bankruptcy. The petition provides for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Court, acquired the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato _preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bilancio)._ The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the 328 ----- financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and-if appointed-the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims-which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)-is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuity aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be 329 ----- deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the _concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to_ meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest - as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders - to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato _preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of_ the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio),_ or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuity aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a prebankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuity aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_ application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a 330 ----- period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six months. In the procedures for the validation (omologazione) of concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for_ the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a _concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities_ were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. _Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore _fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the_ relevant timing in his or her decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a 331 ----- considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or 332 ----- transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-a-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/ court commissioner. (a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-a-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (i) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. (b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: (i) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. (c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; (iii) iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

However, in accordance with Italian GAAP, there is no specific guidance related to the definition of a business combination. Classification of a business combination is largely dependent on the legal form of the vehicle which has been acquired. In addition, accounting for business combinations under common control is not specifically addressed by Italian GAAP.

Goodwill should not be amortized but should be reviewed for impairment at least annually at the cashgenerating-unit level. A-1 ----- _d)_ _Amortization_ The amortization method used for intangible assets with finite useful lives, shall be disclosed for each class of intangible assets. IFRS provides two measurement models: i) the cost model, in which an asset is recognised at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and ii) the revaluation model, in which items of property, plant and equipment are measured at fair value. If an entity opts for the revaluation model, it shall apply that model to the entire class of property, plant and equipment. Whichever accounting policy is selected, it is required to be applied to entire classes of property, plant and equipment. Please note that according to IFRS the revaluation of assets is never permitted if the cost model is adopted by the company, even if authorized by specific laws. In accordance with IFRS, all investments in subsidiaries are consolidated. IAS 2 does not allow the LIFO method in the inventory valuation. Only FIFO or Weighted Average Cost can be applied. According to IAS 19, Provisions for employee severance indemnities (TFR) must take into consideration the estimated provision to be paid to the employees when they effectively will leave the company. This provision needs to be discounted appropriately, based on the personnel rotation, the expected interest rate and the life expectation. Following the implication of the Italian law No. 296 of December 27, 2006, TFR can be split into two different parts: i) TFR from 1 January 2007 onward is considered a Defined Contribution Plan and no actuarial calculation is necessary; and ii) TFR accrued since 31 December 2006 is a Defined Benefit Plan and an actuarial calculation is required. According to IFRS, loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Debt issuance costs are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and consequently amortised as interest expenses through income statement over the term of the loan. Obtaining a waiver from lenders with respect to a change of control would be considered a cost related to a debt modification. Under IFRS 9, the company must perform the 10% test to determine if it is an extinguishment. This fee may be included or excluded from the calculation based on the company’s accounting policy. Per IFRS 9, “if the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortized over the remaining term of the modified liability.” IFRS 3 Business Combinations (“IFRS 3”) outlines the accounting when an acquirer obtains control of a business, such as an acquisition or merger. Such business combinations are accounted for using the ‘acquisition method’, which generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. A business combination is a transaction or event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return directly to investors or other owners, members or participants (IFRS 3 Appendix A). IFRS 3 is not applicable to business combination under common control, where the business is ultimately controlled by the same parties both before and after the business combination. There is currently no guidance in IFRS on the accounting treatment for combinations among entities under common control. In this case, management shall develop a policy that is relevant to the decision- making needs of users and that is reliable. For these cases, according to common principles normally used, no assets and liabilities are restated to their fair values but they are incorporated at the predecessor carrying values and no new goodwill arises. A-3 ----- The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This core principle is delivered in a five-step model framework: - Identify the contract(s) with a customer; - Identify the performance obligations in the contract; - Determine the transaction price; - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. IFRS 16 specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless (i) the lease term is 12 months or less or (ii) the underlying asset has a low value. Upon lease commencement a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the lease term, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee shall use their incremental borrowing rate (i.e. the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment). Deferred tax assets are classified within non-current assets. A-4 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

General information about the Group SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA (the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on December 14, 2015, and is organised under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société en commandite par actions for an unlimited period, with registered office at 8, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Senningerberg, Luxembourg, whose controlling shareholder is the company STIRLING SQUARE CAPITAL PARTNERS. SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) operate in the regeneration of waste oil, the purification of waste solvents, and the responsible management of a wide range of industrial waste. Through advanced technologies and continuous investments, the Group helps safeguard natural resources and improve quality of life, with sustainable processes, products and solutions for waste management and the optimization of served markets. It has more than 50 years of industrial history founded on the principles of the circular economy starting before it was considered the economy of the future, involving customers, suppliers, institutions, local and global communities in creating economic, environmental and social value. Note 2. Basis of presentation The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the Explanatory Notes which were approved by the Board of Directors of SSCP Green Holdings SCA on September 3, 2021. These Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting standard issued by the Italian Accounting Organization (Organismo Italiano di Contabilità, O.I.C.) and in particular OIC 30 pursuant to the provision of the Italian Civil Code. In preparing the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, however, the Directors reclassified and renamed certain line items in order to render them more easily comparable to the financial information of entities that apply IFRS. These Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP. The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the same principles of consolidation and accounting policies described in the last Consolidated Financial Statements (see the related report for more information). Consistently with the requirements of OIC 30, the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include selected explanatory notes. Current income taxes have been calculated based on the estimated taxable profit for the interim period. Current income tax assets and liabilities have been measured at the amount expected to be paid from the taxation Authorities, using tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and the tax rates estimated on an annual basis. The items reported in the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are stated in accordance with the general principles of prudence and accruals and in accordance on going concern basis and taking account of the economic function of the assets and liabilities. The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are shown in Euro, which is the functional currency of the Group and its subsidiaries. All amounts shown in this document are expressed in millions of Euro, unless otherwise specified. Certain numerical figures set out in this Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial data presented in millions and certain percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in columns or rows of tables in this Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. _Covid-19 pandemic_ In 2020, the national and international scenario was characterized by the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures for its containment by the public authorities of the countries concerned. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced and, since then, has spread around the globe, including in Italy. The resulting disease, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In F-8 ----- response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures, the Group transitioned a portion of its workforce to remote working and experienced operational difficulties; the plants in Pieve Fissiraga and in Ceccano were closed for several weeks between April and June 2020 resulting in a decrease of volume of waste oil processed of approximately 68% compared to the corresponding period of 2019; furthermore, the collection, transportation and storage activities of Environment business unit experienced a slowdown between March and June 2020. Additionally, even though the nationwide quarantine in Italy was lifted on May 4, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall Italian economy and, in turn, Group’s operations and Group’s customers’ operations. These circumstances have created a context of uncertainty that has distorted the pursuit of the strategic objectives set in place by the Group in recent years, and have created significant impacts on the results of 2020, both in terms of revenues and margins in particular in the segment of Regeneration during the lockdown imposed by the Italian government. The Group has not suffered financial tensions in net working capital management following the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the reduction in revenues and margins, Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. during 2020 agreed with financial institutions an amendment to the financial covenants related to its medium-long term loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the following years. Note 3. Scope of consolidation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements The global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions continued in 2021 to varying degrees. The progress made by many countries in administering vaccines to their populations had a positive effect, while the emergence of new variants of the virus led to a renewed rise in infections at a national level. Compared with the prior year period, the global economy recorded positive growth. Performance during the first half of 2021 is in part dependent on the extent to which the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic were already materializing and the degree of intensity applied to the measures taken to contain the spread.Scope of consolidation and presentation of the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements The scope of consolidation of the Group was determined by referring to the legal control that the Parent Company exercises over its subsidiaries.

Note 4. Consolidation accounting principles The Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standard OIC 17. The subsidiaries are included in the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the date in which the Parent Company acquires control and are no longer consolidated from the date in which the Parent Company loses control. The financial statements of companies included in the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are consolidated on a line-by line basis. The main consolidation criteria, consistently applied year over year described herein, are as follows: - the carrying amount of investments in consolidated subsidiaries is eliminated against the corresponding net equity; positive differences are allocated, where possible and gross of the related tax effect, to the subsidiaries’ assets; - Any non-attributable residual amount calculated at the date of acquisitions, represents goodwill and is recognized as intangible assets and amortized over its estimated useful life. Any negative residual, if it is attributable to the forecast of unfavorable results, is recognized in the “Consolidation provision for future risks and charges”; in the event that there is no such forecast of future results, it is entered in a line of consolidated shareholders’ equity, labelled “Consolidation reserve”; - all payables, receivables, revenue and costs, including any unrealized profit and losses, with the related tax effect, deriving from transactions between subsidiaries and the parent company or between subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation; - deferred or prepaid taxes are calculated on the temporary differences between the taxable income and the economic result of the companies included in the consolidation; F-10 ----- - the portion of the Profit/(loss) for the period attributable to non-controlling interest is recognized on the basis of the corresponding percentage of Shareholders’ equity not owned by the Parent Company; - the portion of the Equity attributable to non-controlling interests is recognized on the basis of the percentage not owned by the Parent Company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,261,INDEX TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,261.19,Use of estimates,261.19.1,,"The preparation of the current Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management’s estimates and assumptions on the values of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements and on the information relating to the assets and potential liabilities at the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement date. The estimates and assumptions used are based on past experience and other factors considered relevant. However, actual results could differ from the estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the impacts of any resulting changes are recognized directly in the income statement in the period in which the estimates are revised, if the revision impacts only that period, or also in future periods, if the revision impacts both the current and future periods. The most significant accounts concerned by these uncertainties are (i) the valuation of goodwill; (ii) the evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets after the execution of the impairment test exercise and (iii) the depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets; (iv) the environmental liabilities; (v) the bad debt provision; (vi) the provision for risks and charges; (vii) the inventory obsolescence provision. _Valuation of Goodwill_ With reference to the valuation of Goodwill, it involves a complex procedure that requires the application of various valuation methods, including the identification and measurement of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities taken on. These methods use the following inputs: historical information, forecasts based on estimates or on observation of the market e.g. the royalty rate for the use of comparable assets, the discount rate, the residual useful life of the assets acquired, etc. _Evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_ With reference to the measurement of the recoverable value of the goodwill, other intangibles assets and property, plant and equipment, the Directors, conducted three different impairment tests, one for the Regeneration, one for the Purification and one for Environmental as of December 31, 2020. The aforementioned impairment tests were still considered applicable as of June 30, 2021 considering both the plan and the forecasts used - for which no events emerged that could materially modify the validity - and the stress tests carried out. The forecasts are based on the assumptions characterized in any case by intrinsic uncertainty, both with reference to macroeconomic and sector conditions as well as specific conditions tied to the Group, also based on the current status and knowledge of the pandemic crisis available at the time the estimate was made, which is inherently uncertain, any change of which—currently unpredictable—might result in final results that are different than what is estimated, which might require at consolidated level an impairment loss. _Depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets_ With reference to the depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets, the depreciation rates of the Property, plant and equipment and the amortization rates of Goodwill and Other intangible assets are calculated based on the best estimate of the residual useful life of the assets linked to production made by the Group’s technicians and Directors. As detailed in Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, in 2020, the Group exercised the option provided by art. 110 of Italian Law Decree 104/2020, converted into Law no. 126 of October 13, 2020, and registered the revaluation of selected Property, plant and equipment. The subsidiaries which carried out the revaluations in 2020 are: Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l., S.E.P.I. Ambiente S.r.l., De Luca Servizi Ambiente S.r.l., Intereco S.r.l., Carbo-Nafta Ecologia S.r.l., Rimondi Paolo S.r.l., Neda Ambiente FVG S.r.l., Idroclean S.r.l., Agrid S.r.l., Labiolab S.r.l., Itelyum Purification S.r.l., Imtras S.r.l., Centro Risorse S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l., Keoma S.r.l. and Ferolmet S.r.l.. As of December 31, 2020, on the basis of the expert estimate, the Group has entered higher values in Property, plant and equipment for € 168.5 million. The expert estimate attests that the net book value after revaluation does F-11 ----- not exceed the recoverable amount likely to be attributable in relation to the production capacity and the possibility of using the abovementioned Property, plant and equipment by the companies and in relation to its current value. For the purposes of the revaluation, the Group used the accounting technique of increasing the historical cost (gross amount) up to the level of fair value of the asset and for the difference by reducing the accumulated depreciation, taking into account, however, that, in the case where the fair value of the asset was equal to or less than the gross amount of the asset, the relative accumulated depreciation was decreased, while in the case where the fair value of the asset was higher the gross amount has been increased. As a result of the assessment carried out, the Group also choose to an extension of the period of the original depreciation, resulting from an assessment by the Directors of the residual useful life of the assets, also on the basis of the aforementioned expert estimate. _Environmental liabilities_ The Group is subject, in relation to its activities, to numerous laws and regulations on environmental protection at European, national, regional and local level, including the laws which implement international conventions and protocols relating to the activities carried out. The measurement of future liabilities in connection with reclamation and restoration obligations in relation to sites and/or land on which the Group carries out its business is a complex process based on technical and financial assumptions made by the Group’s management and supported by independent experts where necessary. The estimates are reviewed annually to verify that the amounts recorded are the best reflection of the costs the Group will face. If any significant variations are found, the amounts are adjusted. The key factors for revising cost estimates are the developments in the Group’s operations, technologies and the environmental regulations. Measurement of environmental liabilities recorded in the financial statements take into account the environmental legislation currently in force. However, this measurement could be subject to variations, even to a significant extent, in relation to: (i) the possibility of further contamination arising; (ii) the results of current and future refurbishment and the other possible effects arising from the application of the laws in force; (iii) the possible effects of new laws and regulations for environmental protection; (iv) the effects of any technological innovations for environmental cleansing; and (v) the possibility of disputes concerning the environmental liability for specific sites and the difficulty of determining the potential consequences of this, including in relation to the liability of other parties and any indemnity. _Provisions for risks and charges and bad debt provision_ Regarding the provisions for risks and charges and the bad debt provision, the Half-yearly Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflects the estimate of liabilities and the collectability of the assets based on the best knowledge of solvency of the counterparts and the state of litigation, using the information provided by the legal and tax advisors, who assist the Group as well as considering outstanding contracts with the counterparts. The estimate of the risks is subject to uncertainties and it cannot be excluded that in future fiscal years, costs which cannot currently be estimated, might arise due to a worsening of the state of litigation and the level of counterparts’ solvency. _Inventory obsolescence provision_ The inventory obsolescence provision reflects the management’s estimate of the Group’s expected losses in value, determined on the basis of past experience. Abnormal market price trends could have repercussions in future inventory write-downs. F-12 ----- The preparation of the current Consolidated Financial Statements requires management’s estimates and assumptions on the values of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements and on the information relating to the assets and potential liabilities at the Consolidated Financial Statement date. The estimates and assumptions used are based on past experience and other factors considered relevant. However, actual results could differ from the estimates.

F-45 ----- _Valuation of Goodwill_ With reference to the valuation of Goodwill, it involves a complex procedure that requires the application of various valuation methods, including the identification and measurement of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities taken on. These methods use the following inputs: historical information, forecasts based on estimates or on observation of the market e.g. the royalty rate for the use of comparable assets, the discount rate, the residual useful life of the assets acquired, etc. The Directors also utilized the work of independent experts. _Evaluation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets_ With reference to the measurement of the recoverable value of the goodwill, other intangibles assets and property, plant and equipment, the Directors, conducted three different impairment tests, one for the Regeneration, one for the Purification and one for Environmental as of December 31, 2020 2019 and 2018. In order to perform such impairment tests for the Regeneration and the Purification the value in use was determined on the basis of economic and financial projections of each CGU for a period of 5 years and a terminal value based on the perpetuity method, considering a growth rate (g-rate) not higher than 2%. These cash flows were discounted using a discount rate (WACC), taking into account the specific risks of the business and which reflects the current market valuations of the cost of money. The calculation of the weighted average cost of capital, led to a value of 9.0% for Regeneration and to a value of 8.4% for Purification. For Environmental the impairment test was performed on the basis of fair value, determined considering the amount that may be received for the sale of an asset or that may be paid for the transfer of a liability in a regular transaction between market operators as at the valuation date (i.e. exit price). No impairment emerged from the impairment tests, resulting in the value in use obtained significantly higher than the net invested capital. The forecasts—including the level of investments and the change in net working capital—are based on the assumptions characterized in any case by intrinsic uncertainty, both with reference to macroeconomic and sector conditions as well as specific conditions tied to the Group, also based on the current status and knowledge of the pandemic crisis available at the time the estimate was made, which is inherently uncertain, any change of which—currently unpredictable—might result in final results that are different than what is estimated, which might require at consolidated level an impairment loss. _Depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets_ With reference to the depreciation of Property, plant and equipment and the amortization of Goodwill and Other intangible assets, the depreciation rates of the Property, plant and equipment and the amortization rates of Goodwill and Other intangible assets are calculated based on the best estimate of the residual useful life of the assets linked to production made by the Group’s technicians and Directors. _Environmental liabilities_ The Group is subject, in relation to its activities, to numerous laws and regulations on environmental protection at European, national, regional and local level, including the laws which implement international conventions and protocols relating to the activities carried out.

General information about the Group SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA (the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on December 14, 2015, and is organised under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société en commandite par actions for an unlimited period, with registered office at 8, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Senningerberg, Luxembourg, whose controlling shareholder is the company STIRLING SQUARE CAPITAL PARTNERS. SSCP GREEN HOLDINGS SCA and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) operate in the regeneration of waste oil, the purification of waste solvents, and the responsible management of a wide range of industrial waste. Through advanced technologies and continuous investments, the Group helps safeguard natural resources and improve quality of life, with sustainable processes, products and solutions for waste management and the optimization of served markets. It has more than 50 years of industrial history founded on the principles of the circular economy starting before it was considered the economy of the future, involving customers, suppliers, institutions, local and global communities in creating economic, environmental and social value. Note 2. Basis of presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the Explanatory Notes which were approved by the Board of Directors of SSCP Green Holdings SCA on September 3, 2021. These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting standards issued by the Italian Accounting Organization (Organismo Italiano di Contabilità, O.I.C.) pursuant to the provision of the Italian Civil Code. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, however, the Directors reclassified and renamed certain line items in order to render them more easily comparable to the financial information of entities that apply IFRS. These Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Italian GAAP, but do not constitute the Company’s statutory consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018. The items reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements are stated in accordance with the general principles of prudence and accruals and in accordance on going concern basis and taking account of the economic function of the assets and liabilities. The Consolidated Financial Statements are shown in Euro, which is the functional currency of the Group and its subsidiaries. All amounts shown in this document are expressed in millions of Euro, unless otherwise specified. Certain numerical figures set out in this Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial data presented in millions and certain percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in columns or rows of tables in this Consolidated Financial Statements may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. _Covid-19 pandemic_ In 2020, the national and international scenario was characterized by the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictive measures for its containment by the public authorities of the countries concerned. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced and, since then, has spread around the globe, including in Italy. The resulting disease, COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide quarantine together with several other measures. As a result of these restrictive measures, the Group transitioned a portion of its workforce to remote working and experienced operational difficulties; the plants in Pieve Fissiraga and in Ceccano were closed for several weeks between April and June 2020 resulting in a decrease of volume of waste oil processed of approximately 68% compared to the corresponding period of 2019; furthermore, the collection, transportation and storage activities of Environment business unit experienced a slowdown between March and June 2020. Additionally, even though the nationwide quarantine in Italy was lifted on May 4, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall Italian economy and, in turn, Group’s operations and Group’s customers’ operations. F-36 ----- These circumstances have created a context of uncertainty that has distorted the pursuit of the strategic objectives set in place by the Group in recent years, and have created significant impacts on the results of 2020, both in terms of revenues and margins in particular in the segment of Regeneration during the lockdown imposed by the Italian government. The Group has not suffered financial tensions in net working capital management following the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. As a result of the reduction in revenues and margins, Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. during 2020 agreed with financial institutions an amendment to the financial covenants related to its medium-long term loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the following years. The global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions continued in 2021 to varying degrees. The progress made by many countries in administering vaccines to their populations had a positive effect, while the emergence of new variants of the virus led to a renewed rise in infections at a national level. Compared with the prior year period, the global economy recorded positive growth. Performance during the first half of 2021 is in part dependent on the extent to which the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic were already materializing and the degree of intensity applied to the measures taken to contain the spread. Note 3. Scope of consolidation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements The scope of consolidation of the Group was determined by referring to the legal control that the Parent Company exercises over its subsidiaries.

Note 4. Consolidation accounting principles The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standard OIC 17. The subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date in which the Parent Company acquires control and are no longer consolidated from the date in which the Parent Company loses control. The financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are consolidated on a line-by-line basis. The main consolidation criteria, consistently applied year over year described herein, are as follows: - the carrying amount of investments in consolidated subsidiaries is eliminated against the corresponding net equity; positive differences are allocated, where possible and gross of the related tax effect, to the subsidiaries’ assets; - Any non-attributable residual amount calculated at the date of acquisitions, represents goodwill and is recognized as intangible assets and amortized over its estimated useful life. Any negative residual, if it F-38 ----- is attributable to the forecast of unfavorable results, is recognized in the “Consolidation provision for future risks and charges”; in the event that there is no such forecast of future results, it is entered in a line of consolidated shareholders’ equity, labelled “Consolidation reserve”; - all payables, receivables, revenue and costs, including any unrealized profit and losses, with the related tax effect, deriving from transactions between subsidiaries and the parent company or between subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation; - deferred or prepaid taxes are calculated on the temporary differences between the taxable income and the economic result of the companies included in the consolidation; - the portion of the Profit (loss) for the year attributable to non-controlling interest is recognized on the basis of the corresponding percentage of Shareholders’ equity not owned by the Parent Company; - the portion of the Equity attributable to non-controlling interests is recognized on the basis of the percentage not owned by the Parent Company. Note 5. Significant accounting policies The most significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with legislative requirements, are the following:",N/A,as_expected,2021,447
155_4,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,261,INDEX TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,261.130,"Revaluation as allowed by Italian Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020",261.130.1,,"In 2020, the Group exercised the option provided by art. 110 of Italian Law Decree 104/2020, converted into Law no. 126 of October 13, 2020, and registered the revaluation of selected Property, plant and equipment. The subsidiaries which carried out the revaluations in 2020 are: Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l., S.E.P.I. Ambiente S.r.l., De Luca Servizi Ambiente S.r.l., Intereco S.r.l., Carbo-Nafta Ecologia S.r.l., Rimondi Paolo S.r.l., Neda Ambiente FVG S.r.l., Idroclean S.r.l., Agrid S.r.l., Labiolab S.r.l., Itelyum Purification S.r.l., Imtras S.r.l., Centro Risorse S.r.l., Innovazione Chimica S.r.l., Keoma S.r.l. and Ferolmet S.r.l.. The value of Property, plant and equipment was determined by comparing the Fair value of the assets, as indicated in the expert estimate prepared by PRAXI S.p.A., with registered office in C.so Vittorio Emanuele 3 Torino, with the residual net book value, after the depreciation for the year 2020. In particular, the Fair value of the assets was determined by applying an evaluation process based on its hypothetical replacement with a new similar asset. This way, its “maximum value” has been determined and it is identifiable with the cost the Group would incur to replace it or with its exact replica (“new construction cost”) or, alternatively, if less, with that of an assets with equivalent characteristics and production capacities (“replacement cost”). Subsequently, the maximum value of the assets has been reduced to take into account the loss of value from the “physical depreciation” and from the “functional obsolescence” which measure their loss of value with respect to a new one. On the basis of the expert estimate, the Group has entered higher values in Property, plant and equipment for € 168.5 million. The expert estimate attests that the net book value after revaluation does not exceed the recoverable amount likely to be attributable in relation to the production capacity and the possibility of using the abovementioned Property, plant and equipment by the companies and in relation to its current value. For the purposes of the revaluation, the Group used the accounting technique of increasing the historical cost (gross amount) up to the level of fair value of the asset and for the difference by reducing the accumulated depreciation, taking into account, however, that, in the case where the fair value of the asset was equal to or less than the gross amount of the asset, the relative accumulated depreciation was decreased, while in the case where the fair value of the asset was higher the gross amount has been increased. As a result of the assessment carried out, the Group choose to an extension of the period of the original depreciation, resulting from an assessment by the Directors of the residual useful life of the assets, also on the basis of the aforementioned expert estimate. F-39 ----- All the subsidiaries have also opted to the substitute tax, equal to 3% of the revaluation, to recognize it for tax purposes. Tax recognition begins, for what concern the deductibility of depreciation, from the year following that in which the revaluation has been made (2021 fiscal year), while in the case of transfer with consideration the higher values are recognized from January 1, 2024. The accounting counterpart of the increase in the value of Property, plant and equipment is an equity reserve, labelled as “Revaluation reserve – Italian Law Decree 104/2020”, for a total amount net of the aforementioned substitute tax of € 163.4 million. The “Revaluation reserve –Italian Law Decree 104/2020” is subject to particular civil constraints better explained below and it is a reserve under “suspension of tax” which, when distributed to the Shareholders, contributes to the formation of the Group’s taxable amount and the taxable income of the recipient. Although this reserve is in the nature of a reserve under suspension of tax, by way of derogation from the general rule and as provided for in document OIC 25 (par. 64), the Group has not entered the deferred tax liability because, from the historical trend in the distribution of dividends from the subsidiaries to the Parent Company, the likelihood of future distributions of these reserves to the shareholders was considered to be low. The substitute tax was therefore entered in Tax and social security payables for € 5.1 million (of which € 1.7 million due on 2021 and € 3.4 million in due on 2022 and 2023). The table below shows the effect of the revaluation mentioned above for each category of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

Where it is not possible to estimate the useful life, goodwill is amortized over a period of 10 years. Other intangible assets are recorded at purchase or production cost, increased by directly allocated acquisition costs, adjusted by the relative amortization provision and increased by any monetary revaluations in accordance with law. Other intangible assets are recorded with the approval of the Board of Statutory Auditors in the cases established by law. Start up and formation expenses are amortized over five years, with straight-line amortization applied. Development costs are amortized according to their useful life, in exceptional cases in which it is not possible to reliably estimate their useful life, they are amortized over a period not exceeding five years.

In the event that, independently of the amortization already recorded, there is a permanent loss of value, the asset is derecognized; if, in subsequent years, the reasons justifying the write-down cease, the original value is restored, within the limits of the value that the asset would have had without the impairment loss, except for the item ‘‘Goodwill’’ and ‘‘Deferred charges’’.

For further information regarding the revaluation made in 2020, please refer to paragraph “Revaluation as allowed by Italian Law n. 126 of October 13, 2020” above. The depreciation rates of the Property, plant and equipment are calculated based on the residual utilization value, on the basis of rates considered adequate to represent the usage and/or consumption of the assets and their reduced usage over time.

The fair value is the amount that may be received for the sale of an asset or that may be paid for the transfer of a liability in a regular transaction between market operators as at the valuation date (i.e. exit price). The fair value of an asset is determined by adopting the valuations that market operators would use to determine the price of the asset. The value in use is determined by discounting projected cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and, if they are significant and can be reasonably determined, from its sale at the end of its useful life, net of any disposal costs. Cash flows are determined based on reasonable, documentable assumptions representing the best estimate of future economic conditions which will occur during the remaining useful life of the asset, with a greater emphasis on outside information. Discounting is done at a rate reflecting current market conditions for the time value of money and specific risks of the asset not reflected in the estimated cash flows. The valuation is done for individual assets or for the smallest identifiable group of assets which, through ongoing use, generates incoming cash flow that is largely independent of those of other assets or groups of assets (“cash-generating units” or CGUs). The CGUs identified by the Group are the following: Regeneration, Purification and Environment. If the reasons for impairment losses no longer apply, the assets (except for goodwill) are revalued, and the adjustment is posted to the income statement as a revaluation (recovery of value). The recovery of value is applied to the lower of the recoverable value and the book value before any impairment losses previously carried out, less any depreciation that would have been recorded if an impairment loss had not been recorded for the asset.",N/A,as_expected,2021,447

The cost of inventories includes the purchase cost, and any ancillary charges. Ancillary charges, as they are fungible, are calculated as the weighted average cost of the year. Inventories of raw materials, work in progress and finished products are also valued on the basis of the FIFO criterion at the lower of the purchase or production cost and the net realizable value. The production cost includes ancillary charges, costs directly attributable to the product and other costs, for the reasonably attributable portion, relating to the manufacturing period. In the Landriano Plant, (i) raw materials of pharmaceutical products and alcohol are valued at the last purchase cost; work in progress pharmaceutical products and alcohol are valued at specific cost, which consists in the attribution to the individual physical units of the costs specifically incurred for them; (ii) finished products are valued at production cost. In the Rho Plant, raw materials are valued at the last purchase cost and finished products are valued at the weighted average cost of the year. Inventories are subject to devaluation in the balance sheet when the realizable value inferable from the market trend is lower than the relative book value. Obsolete and slow-moving stocks are written down in relation to their possibility of use or realization. Where it is no longer possible to estimate the goods at incurred cost as determined by the above criteria, due to lower selling prices, depreciated goods, obsolescence, slow moving or possibility of use, the net realizable value determined by the market performance is applied Inventories.

This risk concerns the possibility that an increase in market rates results in higher interest charges. This type of hedge seeks to minimize interest rate changes generated by loans at variable rates. The exposure to interest rate risk is calculated on the basis of the loan repayment plans and the parameters used to calculate interest. Specifically, the Group—in accordance with the requirements of accounting standard OIC 32—accounted for hedging transactions according to the hedge accounting criterion for the management of the following financial risks: As of December 31, 2020 Itelyum Regeneration S.r.l. has in place an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) for a notional total amount of € 48.5 million (€ 52.5 million and € 56.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) with Banca Intesa San Paolo and Banco BPM with maturity on December 31, 2021, in order to hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuations relating to the loan.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
