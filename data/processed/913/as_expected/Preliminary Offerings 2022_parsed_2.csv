While we believe that the Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information can be useful to potential investors seeking to evaluate our performance over time, the Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information may not have been prepared on the same basis as the Financial Statements, and no reconciliation has been provided from the Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information to the Financial Statements. The Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management of the Group. The independent statutory auditor of the Group has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information for the purpose of its inclusion herein. The Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks and uncertainties. Actual results could have differed materially if the relevant acquired businesses had been owned for the entire period; therefore, there are significant differences between the Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information and the Financial Statements. We did not own or control the Acquired Companies prior to the dates on which control passed in accordance with the relevant acquisition agreements. Additionally, upon taking control of the Acquired Companies, we implemented our own strategy which in some cases may have differed in material ways from the prior owners’ strategy. The Acquisition Adjusted Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.7,Non-IFRS Measures,7.7.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. We refer to these measures as “Non-IFRS Measures,” as they ----- exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. In particular, we present certain Non-IFRS Measures of the Group and ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum, including Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, capital expenditure, cash flow conversion, direct margin, gross margin, net working capital, operating cash flow, organic revenue growth, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other measures and ratios that are not recognized by, or presented in_ accordance with, IFRS. We use such measures to assess the financial performance and liquidity of our business. We believe that these and similar measures are used widely by the investment community, securities analysts and other interested parties, as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity and are intended to assist in the analysis of our results of operations, profitability and ability to service debt. However, Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows: - “Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted by assuming that the Acquired Companies had been acquired as of January 1, 2019, instead of the actual dates on which the acquisitions occurred or were deemed to have occurred for accounting purposes; - “Acquisition Adjusted Revenue” is defined as revenue, adjusted by assuming that the Acquired Companies had been acquired as of January 1, 2019, instead of the actual dates on which the acquisitions occurred or were deemed to have occurred for accounting purposes; - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net consolidated income before provisions for depreciation on working capital and risks, income tax expense, other financial income (expenses), cost of gross debt, income from cash and cash equivalents, other operating income and expenses, gains (losses) on disposals, restructuring costs, amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions and amortization (other than goodwill); - “Adjusted EBITDA margin”is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage; - “Capital expenditure” is defined as the sum of disbursements as a result of acquisition of intangible assets and disbursements as a result of acquisition of property, plant and equipment; - “Cash flow conversion”is defined as (x) Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation of right of use assets associated with IFRS 16 leases (which we consider as a proxy for IFRS 16 lease payments), less capital expenditure divided by (y) Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation of right of use assets associated with IFRS 16 leases, expressed as a percentage; - “Direct margin” is defined as (x) the revenue generated by an activity less the direct costs associated with that activity divided by (y) revenue generated by that activity, expressed as a percentage; - “Gross margin” is defined as revenue less billable costs, which consist of (v) billable FTE staff costs and subcontracting costs, (w) cost of billable services (such as cost of materials, licenses and maintenance purchases), (x) indirect billable costs allocated to billable FTEs and reinvoiced to customers (rental, purchases and external fees) and (y) capitalized internal R&D expenses reduced by the related depreciation. - “Net working capital” is defined as (x) the sum of inventories and works in progress, trade receivables (net), unbilled revenue, prepaid expenses and other receivables less (y) the sum of trade payables, deferred income, down payments, social payables, tax payables and other payables; - “Operating cash flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, less depreciation of right of use assets associated with IFRS 16 leases (which we consider as a proxy for IFRS 16 lease payments), less capital expenditure, less change in net working capital (excluding factoring impact); - “Organic revenue growth” is defined as the percentage growth in Group revenue between two periods whereby: (i) for the periods 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016, the revenues used for the calculation are the reported revenues for the two periods, as adjusted, for the subsequent period, (a) to exclude the revenue contribution of any entity acquired in that period and (b) to exclude the revenue contribution of entities acquired in the prior period to the extent of the corresponding period prior to acquisition; (ii) for the periods 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, the revenue used for the calculation is our reported revenue, as adjusted to (a) include the revenue contribution of entities acquired in the year ended December 31, 2016 (on a pro forma basis as if the acquisitions were completed on January 1, 2016) and (b) exclude the revenue contribution of entities acquired on or after January 1, 2017; and (iii) for the period 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, the revenue used for the calculation is our reported revenue, as adjusted to include (a) the revenue contribution of IECISA on a pro forma basis, as if the acquisition was completed on January 1, 2019 and (b) exclude the revenue contribution of all other entities acquired on or after January 1, 2019; and ----- - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted as described in “Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data—As Adjusted Financial Data.” We present Non-IFRS Measures for informational purposes only. Such measures and ratios may not accurately reflect our performance, liquidity or our ability to incur debt, have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or net profit or any other performance measures derived from or in accordance with IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only as a supplement to evaluate our performance. The Non-IFRS Measures contained in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC, will not be subject to review by the SEC and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the SEC. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. For an explanation and reconciliation of certain of these Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measure, see “Summary—Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data—Other Financial _Data”and “Summary—Summary Historical and Certain Other Financial Data—As Adjusted Financial Data.”_ By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe our EBITDA-based Non-IFRS Measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. We believe a presentation of the EBITDA-based Non-IFRS Measures is useful to investors to assess our liquidity. Some of the limitations of EBITDA-based Non-IFRS Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they may not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures; and - our calculation and presentation of EBITDA-based Non-IFRS Measures in this Offering Memorandum is different from the calculation of “Consolidated EBITDA” and other measures described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes” and contained in the Indenture. Accordingly, the EBITDA-based Non-IFRS Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum do not provide precise indications as to the level of our adherence to the terms of the Indenture. Because of these limitations, our EBITDA-based Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of operational performance or limitations nor as discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Combined financial ----- information differs from consolidated financial information in that combined financial information does not reflect deductions for intercompany eliminations. The Guarantor Coverage Information is subject to important limitations and investors should view the Guarantor Coverage Information with caution. The Guarantor Coverage Information included in this Offering Memorandum has not been audited or reviewed, has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards and does not give effect to any of the adjustments applied in calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022.

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We believe we are one of Europe’s leading IT services companies, providing a holistic suite of digital services and solutions to over 10,000 customers in 29 countries across Europe, Latin America, North America, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We are well-positioned in our key geographic markets (France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal) as an end-to-end services and solutions provider, with comprehensive offerings that are strategically diversified by activity, industry vertical and technology. We operate across eight key industry verticals: Public Sector and Healthcare, Financial Services, Transport Travel Services (TTS), Energy, Utilities and Chemicals (EUC), Retail and Consumer Goods (RCG), Telecom Media Technology (TMT), Industry and Services and Defense and Security. We also provide a wide range of end-to-end services and solutions, from custom software integration, solutions development, application management and consulting, to outsourcing and value-added reselling, combining innovation-based differentiation and automation-based efficiency. We categorize our portfolio of services and solutions into seven activities: Application Services, Business Solutions, Infrastructure Services, Value-Added Reselling, Outsourcing, Consulting and Software Solutions. We believe that our wide range of digital services and solutions, coupled with the quality of our work, the proximity-based nature of our delivery model and our local and linguistic expertise, are a key differentiating factor of our business, increasing customer satisfaction and retention, while contributing to our diversified revenue base. The breadth of these offerings gives us exposure to well-diversified end-market industry verticals, with no industry vertical representing more than 30% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. Within the global IT services market, we operate in attractive and growing geographic markets, mainly France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, where growth is mainly driven by structural digital trends, including digital penetration of new business areas, increased outsourcing and external IT expenditure, the boost in digitalization led by COVID-19 and the increased complexity of systems and software required to maintain legacy IT infrastructure. We are a long-term partner of large, blue-chip IT customers and a one-stop shop for fast-growing mid-market customers, which we serve through our regional footprint and local delivery networks. Large companies accounted for more than 90% of our revenue from our top 100 customers for the year ended December 31, 2021. We maintain long-term relationships with many of these customers. More than half of our top ten customers have been with us for more than ten years and revenue generated from our top ten customers grew at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 4% over the same period. We estimate that recurring and highly repeatable revenue accounted for approximately 71% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, translating into a strong demand backlog and revenue visibility. We believe that our business has a differentiated growth platform which is demonstrated by our historic performance, driven by our diverse value proposition and efficient execution capabilities. We are also an established consolidation platform, in particular through the acquisition and integration of more than 25 companies since 2016. In successfully scaling-up our business, we have benefitted from the experience of our CEO, Vincent Rouaix, and CFO, Cyril Malher, and we currently benefit from the support and expertise of Bain Capital, who has been our majority shareholder since July 2022. Among other advantages, this has allowed us to maintain our strong track record of attracting and retaining best-in-class talent, which are at the heart of innovation in our business. Over five decades, we have grown organically and through acquisitions to become one of the leading providers of IT services in Europe. As such, we intend to strategically position ourselves in key markets such as the French and Spanish markets and aim to capture the expected structural digital transformation and rise in demand for IT services. We also aim to continue leveraging our market expansion track record to push significant growth initiatives throughout our business, including pursuing new growth opportunities, markets and business models. Furthermore, we intend to maintain and consolidate our leadership position in our core IT activities and in our various industry verticals, while continuing the service portfolio transformation ----- towards our Consulting and Business Solutions activities. As the IT services market remains highly fragmented, we seek to further strengthen our position and broaden our product portfolio, capabilities and geographic presence by continuing to consolidate smaller players. As one of the largest multi-local players in the fragmented IT services market, we have the resources and expertise, including a deep knowledge of legacy IT infrastructures, to act as a true partner to our customers in their digital transformation. Multi-local providers like us generally benefit from regional footprints and high customer proximity in several countries. We see focused investments in talent and vendor partnerships as an opportunity to accelerate the shift of our revenue mix towards digital services and solutions, with expected corresponding uplift in organic revenue growth and margin. In addition, we seek to continue leveraging our diversified operating platform and realizing economies of scale to grow our profitability and improve our margins. We believe that we have the potential to close the gap between our profit margin levels and our peers’ through several identified, tangible levers, including streamlining our organization, optimizing our subcontracting process, increasing the flexibility of our cost structure. Our competitive advantages, operating model and the attractive underlying fundamentals of the IT services market in which we operate, have enabled us to deliver a strong financial performance, with our revenue increasing at a CAGR of 17.9% over the two years ended December 31, 2021 and organic revenue growth of 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Large and attractive underlying markets with secular growth drivers,"We operate in the global IT services market, which has historically grown in line with or faster than GDP in each of the key countries in which we operate—France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, which collectively accounted for 89% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022—with periods of accelerated growth that have been largely driven by technology transitions and related digital transformation trends. These attractive and growing markets collectively grew, according to the Market Report, at a CAGR of approximately 4.3% from approximately €42 billion in revenue in 2016 to approximately €48 billion in 2019 and, after a brief contraction to approximately €45 billion in 2020, were expected to grow at an estimated CAGR of approximately 5.6% in the period 2020-2025, reaching approximately €59 billion in 2025. See “Industry.” We believe that the growth in the IT services market is and will continue to be mainly driven by structural digitalization trends, including (i) the rising penetration of digital technologies in new business areas and the continued proliferation of new applications and data, prompting companies to adopt larger IT budgets and require continued support; (ii) an increase in IT outsourcing and external IT expenditure due to the need for flexible IT resources, higher service quality, cost savings and better overall end-user engagement; (iii) the boost in digitalization sparked by COVID-19, including acceleration of e-commerce and the adoption of work-from-home tools, which we expect to be permanent; and (iv) the increased complexity of systems and software required to maintain legacy IT infrastructure. In addition, France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal remain relatively underpenetrated, with IT services expenditure representing 1.4%, 1.5%, 1.8% and 1.2% of GDP, respectively, in 2019, compared to more than 2.0% in the United Kingdom and the United States in the same period. We believe that this will create several attractive opportunities for future growth in our key geographic areas. Our market opportunity is also underpinned by increased potential for digitalization across all our key industry verticals, which we believe creates significant headroom for future growth. For instance, legacy infrastructure accounted for approximately 85% of total IT infrastructure in the Public Sector and for approximately 68% of total IT infrastructure in the Financial Services industry in 2020, which is broadly consistent with legacy infrastructure in the French and Spanish IT services markets, which represented 65% of the total IT infrastructure in such markets in the same period. This highlights our key markets’ potential to grow as customers continue to transition to digital models and shift away from legacy IT infrastructures. Our key geographic areas also exhibit significant barriers to entry for new and global competitors, which is expected to provide us with opportunities to grow both operating revenue and margins. These markets are characterized by multi-regional providers like us with difficult-to-replicate characteristics, such as local and long-term relationships with customers, strong knowledge of customers’ IT infrastructures solutions that are deeply entrenched within and are mission-critical for customers, particularly in the Public Sector and Healthcare, Financial Services and EUC industry verticals, regional footprints and local delivery networks and deep knowledge of local markets and complex regulatory dynamics. With respect to international competitors, these significant barriers, together with our proven ability to reduce costs via nearshoring, are ----- reflected by the fact that low-cost Indian operators (who play a key role in various IT services markets) have a limited presence in France and are virtually absent in Spain, two of our key markets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Scaled multi-country IT services platform with leadership in key markets and attractive proposition for large and mid-market customers,"We operate a highly diversified business that provides multiple services across key geographic areas and industry verticals, with a strong local presence, complemented by our growing nearshore capabilities through our 21 global service centers. We believe this makes us a long-term partner of large, blue-chip IT customers and a one-stop shop for fast-growing mid-market customers, who we serve through our regional footprint and local delivery networks. We are a leader in each of the key markets in which we operate, ranking among the top five overall and top two multi-local IT service providers in France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal (based on application implementation services revenue in 2021). Our defensible, attractive market positioning today has been built over several decades through gradual expansion across key geographic areas and industry verticals and building robust and long term relationships with large and mid-market customers. For large customers (including Orange, Airbus, Société Générale, EDF and BNP Paribas), we position ourselves as part of a core panel of three to five lead IT service providers. We differentiate our offering to such customers by being more flexible and responsive than large global IT service providers, and are often more price competitive. For midmarket customers (including Eolane, Euskaltel, ICA and IKKS), we position ourselves as a full-service IT service provider that can be a strategic partner for customers through their digitalization journey or that lack in-house IT expertise. We differentiate ourselves by offering such customers a combination of broad technical capabilities paired with a local footprint. The attractiveness of our offering to customers is illustrated by the fact that we scored above our IT services peers in several key purchasing criteria (“KPCs”), ranking in the top three in the five most important KPCs, including ranking first on price, relationship and flexibility with scores of 4.1, 3.9 and 4.2 (out of 5), respectively (based on customer surveys of medium-to-large companies in France and Spain).",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

We do this by providing various services and solutions across the entire value chain, organized around our seven activities as shown in the graphic below. _Source: Company information._ We believe that our comprehensive suite of services and solutions is a key differentiating factor of our business, increasing customer satisfaction and retention, while contributing to our diversified revenue base.

We are one of the preferred suppliers for many European blue-chip companies, which have significant digitalization and legacy transformation needs and require IT service providers like us that have at-scale delivery capabilities. On the other hand, mid-market customers require a combination of broad technical capabilities, flexibility and a local footprint. ----- Our customers value our consistent quality, the breadth of our IT services and solutions that are tailored to their needs, our understanding of local market characteristics and our comprehensive suite of offerings. We believe that these factors, along with our active management of relationships with our customers, contribute to our consistently high customer satisfaction rates (approximately 90% in France in the year ended December 31, 2021 according to customer satisfaction surveys that we perform at the end of projects on a continuous basis), which we believe contributes to our increasing contract renewal rates (calculated on the basis of the total value of existing contracts rolled forward in any given year), which in France have been at or above 90% since 2019 and at 95% for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the longevity of our customer relationships (almost all of our top ten customers from 2012 were still within our top 16 customers in 2021). We have been serving more than half of our top ten customers for more than ten years, with some relationships dating back to 1995, and our revenue from our top ten customers has grown at a CAGR of approximately 4% over the past ten years, with eight out of ten customers generating higher absolute revenue in 2021 and a relatively similar operating margin over that same period. At the same time, we benefit from low customer concentration and significant customer diversification across our industry verticals. In 2021, our top customer, top ten customers and top 35 customers accounted for 2.7%, 17.5% and 35.3% of our revenue, respectively. We believe that this diversity increases our resilience to periods of economic uncertainty and other fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which we operate.

Our services and solutions include both those that are tailored to specific industry verticals and those that are transversal in nature, _i.e., those that span industry verticals by catering to common problems, including for example, our activity,_ time and content management solutions. For example, in our Public Sector and Healthcare industry vertical, we have tailored and refined our services and solutions for over 40 years to become a privileged partner to more than 3,000 public organizations, (i) providing consulting services focused on digital and open government models, digital education, reengineering and automation of public procurement processes and property management adoption, (ii) improving the citizen experience with a public/social CRM, citizen and transparency portals, and open data platforms and (iii) shaping smart territories with our intelligent city solutions. In the Financial Services industry vertical, we provide innovative offerings including (i) IT services relating to funds administration, payments and settlements solutions, regulatory compliance, risk management and credit management, (ii) compliance solutions to insurance customers with over €14.0 billion in assets managed, helping them monitor approximately 14 million property and casualty contracts, which cover over 8 million individuals and (iii) instant payments and cash management evolution and integration to help expand digital payments usage. In addition to these services, we offer powerful proprietary IP Software Solutions for Public Sector customers, which differentiates our offering in areas such as finance, HR, school transport, intelligent and collaborative territories, social protection, taxation and management of urban planning and housing, emergency medical services, fire services and emergency management. We believe that our business benefits from a relatively high proportion of our operating revenue being generated by sales of Software Solutions based on our own proprietary software or other IP. In 2021, sales from our Software Solutions accounted for 8% of our total revenue. We believe that, in addition to generating recurring revenue and increasing operational leverage, IP-rich software solutions tend to strengthen customer relationships and support strong customer retention, which can enable cross-selling and up-selling of additional services and software, and enhance margins. We have also been investing in strengthening and growing our digital capabilities to cater to the increasing demand for such services and solutions, with digital services and solutions across our services and solutions accounting for approximately 40% of our total contract value for the year ended December 31, 2020. Some of our digital services and solutions include advisory in digital transformation, digital customer experience customization, digital workplace transformation, contract modernization, cloud migration, virtualization and maintenance, data analytics, cybersecurity solutions, and robotic process automation. Finally, we are a long-standing partner of market leading software and cloud vendors for workplace solutions (including Red Hat, Oracle and ServiceNow), data center and multi-cloud providers (including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure) and network and security providers (including Palo Alto Networks). For instance, we benefit from a relationship with SAP spanning over 20 years, resulting in approximately 2,300 accreditations and 350 certifications.

These have been key factors to our above-market growth over the years. By leveraging our resilient and flexible business model through economic downturns, we have demonstrated our ability to maintain profitability while expanding our business through a combination of organic and acquisition-led growth. ----- The following graphics show the evolution of our organic and reported revenue, margins and cash flow conversion over time, demonstrating our ability to produce above-market revenue growth, both organically and inorganically, while achieving stable margins and with improving cash flow conversion in the long term. _Source: Company information_ (1) Organic and Pro Forma Revenues are both rebased to 100, based on 2011 figures; (2) Adjusted for 3SI and Kidiliz contracts ramp down impact. Impact was known at the moment of the acquisition and factored in the acquisition price; (3) Before pro forma adjustments. Pre-IFRS 16 prior to 2019, post-IFRS 16 otherwise; (4) Defined as: (Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure, less depreciation of right of use assets associated with IFRS 16 leases, which we consider as a proxy for IFRS 16 lease payments) divided by (Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation of right of use assets associated with IFRS 16 leases), expressed as a percentage. We have historically maintained margin discipline, suggesting experience and multiple strategies to deal with cost inflation via pass-through to customers (especially in high growth areas), better cost optimization (reallocation of staff across customers and projects, use nearshoring or freelance) and productivity improvements (employment of lean industrialization techniques). We believe that the upwards evolution of our revenue, margins and cash flow conversion over time are mainly driven by our strong structural foundation and highly attractive underlying business model. We increased our operating margin as a percentage of revenue from 6.3% in 2019 to 7.4% in 2021, due to our strong recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, notably in relation to our activity ratio. Our operating margin as a percentage of revenue further improved to 7.6% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, as a result of certain efficiency measures that we are in the process of implementing. In addition to a well-diversified revenue base and an attractive mix of blue-chip and mid-market customers, we have benefited from stable profit margins in recent years, driven by various efficiency measures targeting our portfolio mix and contributing to growth in our direct margin. Furthermore, our asset-light business model has further enhanced cash flow conversion, which increased from 56.8% in 2016 to 77.5% in 2021. Our capital expenditure level is also relatively low, representing 2.3%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our financial policy is to maintain strong cash flow conversion, with a target of at least 70%, in the medium term. While we believe we will be able to accomplish this, our ability to do so will depend on various factors, many of which are not within our control. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve any such results in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

As part of our geographic expansion, our acquisitions include IECISA, Efron and Gesfor, which allowed us to significantly expand our business in Spain and LatAm, Realdolmen, which allowed us to expand in the BeLux market, Impaq, which allowed us to enter the Polish market with high-tech nearshoring capabilities, and Do IT Wise, which allowed us to capitalize on the success of ServiceNow and further expand our service center capabilities. In addition, in Africa, we acquired Somafor, which allowed us to enter the Ivory Coast market, Archos Technology and Capital Consulting, which allowed us to consolidate our leading position in Morocco, Cynapsys, which allowed us to enter the Tunisian market and increase our offshore shared service center capacities and which we capitalized on by acquiring HLi Consulting in 2021. We are experienced in integrating assets and driving cost efficiencies and cross-selling synergies, as demonstrated by the seamless integration and success of our acquired companies. For example, in relation to IECISA, which we acquired in 2020, we have already exceeded our initial objectives and delivered more than €20 million of savings by improving billables and optimizing the costs of certain non-billables, such as property, plant and equipment, general and administrative expenses and subcontracting expense. We have developed a disciplined and clear approach to our M&A strategy, targeting specialized IT services providers, while expanding our geographic footprint and maintaining our local approach.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Top 35,9.5.3,Experienced leadership team and strong focus on talent development that have positioned us for profitable growth,"Our business is supported by our highly-experienced management team, which is widely recognized in the IT services market and has successfully scaled-up and positioned us across various geographies, taking us from a local player to one of the leading IT services providers in Europe. Our senior managers include Vincent Rouaix, who has been our CEO since 2009 and Cyril Malher, who has been our CFO since 2009, each of whom has over 20 years of experience in the IT services market. In addition to our CEO and CFO, the rest of our management team has an average experience of ten years in the IT services market. Under their management, our business is well-positioned to deliver strong growth and successfully implement our growth and transformation strategy. We also have a strong and proven track record of attracting and retaining best-in-class talent, which are at the heart of innovation in our business. As of June 30, 2022, we had more than 27,000 FTEs, the majority of whom are consultants and direct employees, with 4,100 subcontractors, 946 freelancers, dedicated research teams of 150 professionals and a pool of 300 engineers focused on innovation. We are always looking for ways to help our talent with their training and professional development, with more than 10,000 employees and consultants trained, accredited and certified in 2021 by our long-term partners, such as Google and Microsoft. In part due to our strong focus on talent development and focus on innovation, a significant portion of our FTEs remain with us for a long term, with approximately 40% of our FTEs having worked for us for five years or more, and the average tenure of our FTEs for the year ended December 31, 2021 being approximately seven years. We believe that our strong focus on talent development and investment in innovation sets us apart from our competitors. From the year ended December 31, 2019, to the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested a total of approximately €167 million in R&D. Such investments and our large number of long-serving and well-trained FTEs provide a significant barrier to entry into the market for new competitors, who would need to invest a significant amount of time and money to gain such a workforce and similarly innovate. Such barriers to entry also help us maintain profitability while we pursue growth. In addition, we benefit from the expertise, business relationships and knowledge of Bain Capital, who has been our majority shareholder since July 2022. Since its inception in 1984, Bain Capital and its affiliates have completed over 650 transactions and have made investments in more than 350 companies in a broad range of industries, including consumer/retail, financial and business services, healthcare, industrials, and technology, media and telecommunications. Bain Capital has specialized knowledge of the IT services market in Europe, due to its ownership of Engineering—Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A., a leading IT services provider in Italy. ----- Bain Capital also has a long track record of partnering with management teams of technology and digital services companies to accelerate growth. The firm’s technology investments include Brillio, Genpact, Waystar, Viewpoint, Blue Coat, BMC Software and QuEST Global Services, amongst many others.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Top 35,9.5.4,,"~35% **+7% ~56% 2016 2021 _Source: Company information_ Our loyal and sticky customer base provides us with high level of revenue predictability and visibility, both through contractually recurring business and highly repeatable business. A large portion of our customer contracts are long-term in nature, leading to recurring revenue. For example, the length of our project-based contracts across our customer base in France is on average greater than three years. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue, such as certain “time and material” contracts and revenue from our Value-Added Reselling activity, which while not contractually recurring, in our experience are repeatable in nature. We estimate that recurring and highly repeatable revenue accounted for approximately 70% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of January 2022, we estimate that approximately 71% of our 2022 yearly budget was covered through amounts expected to be realized in connection with projects in our weighted pipeline, time and material (“T&M”) contracts for the next three months and oral commitments. This amount increased from approximately 67% in 2021, which we believe reflects our strong demand backlog and gives us a good level of revenue visibility, barring significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop which could impact our weighted pipeline in particular. We also believe our high customer satisfaction, the long-term nature of our customer relationships and the breadth and quality of our services and solutions present important cross-selling opportunities, particularly as we pursue our strategy of growing revenue from digital services and solutions, along with our Business Services and Consulting activities which we view as activities with higher added value and greater revenue growth potential.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategy,9.6.1,Pursue growth and consolidate our positioning as a leading IT services and solutions provider in key markets,"We are in the core panel of IT services and solutions providers for blue-chip corporates and a strategic partner to mid-market companies in the markets in which we operate. Over five decades, we have grown organically and through acquisitions to become one of the leading providers of IT services, software and digital platforms in Europe, with operations in 29 countries across Europe, Latin America, North America, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. In particular, we have established a leading market position in each of our mature and stable markets, such as France, Iberia and BeLux, which we will continue to capitalize on. We also have a robust presence in growing markets, such as Eastern Europe, Africa and LatAm, which helps us diversify our revenue mix. The global IT services market has grown consistently at or above GDP over the long term and we are currently in a period of acceleration due to the digital and cloud transitions. We believe our geographies and industry verticals are relatively underpenetrated. For example, the IT services expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 2019 was at 1.4% in France and 1.5% in Spain, with these countries still being relatively early in the shift to cloud-based services and solutions. We believe this indicates a forward growth trajectory for these markets as both private and public sector customers continue to increase their IT investments to remain competitive and fill the technology gap that currently exists in comparison with other main EU countries. The French and Spanish IT services markets are expected to resume their growth trajectories at a CAGR of 5.5% and 6.9%, respectively, for the 2021-2025 period. See “Industry.” Through our strategic position in these and other key markets, we aim to benefit from the expected structural digital transformation and rise in demand for IT services. We also aim to maintain and consolidate our leadership position in our core activities (such as Application Services and Business Solutions), as well as in our various industry verticals (such as Public Sector and Healthcare and Financial Services), while continuing our service portfolio transformation towards our Business Solutions and Consulting activities. We believe that expanding and cross-selling services will help us continue to be an IT services and solutions provider of choice and a strategic partner for our key customers.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategy,9.6.2,Accelerate the shift of our revenue mix towards digital services and solutions to accelerate business growth and profitability,"In line with market trends, we have been investing in strengthening our digital capabilities with approximately 40% of our total contract value deriving from digital services and solutions in 2020, with a goal to increase that percentage to approximately 60% in the coming years. Our customers increasingly allocate a significant portion of their budgets to cloud-based applications, digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, automation and data analytics, which are key drivers of our digital-led growth. As a result, meeting our customers’ increasing needs in the digital space has become a key focus for us and an area where we intend to generate revenue growth. We have the resources and expertise, including a deep knowledge of legacy IT infrastructures, to accompany our customers in their digital transformation journey. We believe this is particularly valued by customers in our key industry verticals (Financial Services and Public Sector and Healthcare) where a smooth transition is crucial given the mission critical nature of their processes and the high cost of failure due to their highly regulated nature. We also see focused investments in talent and vendor partnerships as an opportunity to accelerate the shift of our revenue mix towards digital services and solutions, with corresponding uplift in organic revenue growth and margin, and believe this is an approach followed successfully by other competitors. We intend to build on our leadership position in our core IT activities to be a leading digital services provider, and we believe our existing customer base and our global delivery model based on proximity to the customer provide a robust base to achieve this. Digital projects we have undertaken for customers include the cloud migration of the technical base of BNP Paribas’s electronic payment system, the redesign and migration of the customer-facing website of BNP Insurance, the migration of corporate customer front-end applications to DevOps and cloud for Orange, the redesign of data warehousing to Google Cloud hosting for Orange, the automation of the process of closing current accounts and passbook accounts for Orange, the cloud migration ----- of databases and management of data APIs for Société Générale and the automation of back-office processes as part of retail bank convergence project within Société Générale. Furthermore, we are a long-standing partner of market leading software and cloud vendors for workplace solutions (including Red Hat, Oracle and ServiceNow), data center and multi-cloud providers (including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure) and network and security providers (including Palo Alto Networks). For instance, we benefit from a relationship with SAP spanning over 20 years, resulting in approximately 2,300 accreditations and 350 certifications. We seek to keep and reinforce our long-standing partnerships with these global software and cloud players as our customers’ needs increasingly shift to digital solutions.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategy,9.6.3,Continue to pursue growth initiatives and opportunities in the large and growing upper mid-market segment,"We intend to continue leveraging our market expansion track record to push significant growth initiatives throughout our business. One of our key initiatives continues to be increasing the proportion of revenue generated by our Business Solutions and Consulting activities as we view these as areas with higher added value and greater revenue growth potential in light of digitalization trends. To pursue additional growth opportunities, we intend to further scale our platform in new geographies and focus on the development of our industry vertical-focused offerings. As one of the largest multi-local players in fragmented IT services markets where scale increasingly matters, we believe that the trend among our customers to consolidate to key partners will benefit large IT service providers (such as ourselves), who can absorb a large portion of IT expenditure from recurring customers. We also seek to capture growth in the upper mid-market segment, leveraging its shift to digital and cloud. This represents a particularly attractive opportunity for us, given our strong presence in the mid-market segment and the fact that there is less competition for such mid-market customers than for larger companies. To adapt our services and solutions to such companies, we intend to continue delivering a comprehensive offering tailored to address these customers’ needs through our broad technical capabilities and local footprint, which we believe gives us a structural advantage against potential competitors by being one of the “one-stop shops” within our industry.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Our Strategy,9.6.4,Further enhance profitability through identified levers,"We seek to continue leveraging our diversified operating platform and realizing economies of scale to grow our profitability and improve our margins. We see significant potential to improve our profitability when comparing ourselves to some of our peers (our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.5% in 2021, which was below the (non-weighted) average of our peers in the French mid-cap market (12.7%), regional providers (14.5%), digital competitors (17.7%) and global IT players (19.8%) (adjusted from public figures to exclude (i) expenses linked to share-based payments and (ii) other operating income and expenses)), we believe that we have the potential to close this gap through several identified, tangible levers. We intend to streamline our organization by simplifying our processes, nearshoring our back-office and increasing capacity utilization. We also intend to optimize our subcontracting process by improving our relationships and increasing synergies with our subcontractors and internalizing longer-tenure subcontractors. We also seek to increase the flexibility of our cost structure by improving our processes in connection with selling, general and administrative expenses by providing local and tailored services and solutions to targeted and underpenetrated markets. Furthermore, we plan on focusing on the lean industrialization and automation of our processes, leading to more efficient delivery, reduced costs and timely execution of our projects. In addition, we seek to realize more effective synergies from future acquisitions, and to realize the full potential of businesses we have already acquired, particularly IECISA, a Spanish technology consulting company with strong market positions in Spain, Portugal and LatAm.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

We have been one of the most active consolidation platforms in the IT services markets in which we operate, successfully acquiring and integrating more than 25 companies since 2016. We have developed a disciplined and systematic approach to acquisition activity, targeting best-in-class specialized IT players with a focus on increasing our capabilities in high-growth areas and consolidating our positions across our industry verticals. We pursue acquisitions that we believe are supported by a strong business case of value creation, ----- provide business continuity and limit disruption to profitability. We believe that this continued focus on acquiring and integrating specialized providers of IT services will allow us to further cross-sell acquired services and solutions into our broad customer base, attract and retain talented employees and strengthen our R&D capabilities.

Furthermore, we make no representation and give no warranty regarding this information and make no undertaking to publish or report any potential changes or updates to this information. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance._ We estimate that our revenue for the year ending December 31, 2022, will be in the range of €2.3 billion to €2.4 billion, compared to €2.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. We currently aim for organic revenue growth over the medium term broadly in line with historical performance, with a slight acceleration over the years. We expect this growth to be achieved mainly through (i) an increased demand in our key markets for all activities in all geographic areas, with moderately faster growth in geographic areas outside of France, and (ii) a shift in our business mix towards activities with higher revenue growth potential, such as Business Solutions and Consulting, and an increase in our digital offerings. In addition, we estimate our operating margin (% of revenue) will be in the range of 8% for the year ending December 31, 2022, compared to 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. We estimate Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of €250 to €270 million for the year ending December 31, 2022, compared to €233.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We aim to continue to increase margin and profitability primarily through (i) an improvement of our activity ratio and the industrialization and automation of our processes as well as (ii) our cost savings initiatives, including streamlining our organization, optimizing our subcontracting process, increasing the flexibility of our cost structure by improving our processes in connection with selling, general and administrative expenses. Based on preliminary results, derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently available, we estimate that revenue grew in July and August 2022 by 10.9% as compared with the same months in 2021, increasing from €314.2 million to €348.5 million, in spite of there being one less working day in both France and Iberia in these months as compared to the same months in 2021. We believe that our revenue mix in July and August 2022 included comparatively more revenue from our VAR activity, which accounted for approximately €41 million of revenue during the period, representing growth of 27% as compared to July and August 2021. Growth in revenue from our VAR activity came principally from Spain, followed by Belgium. We estimate that organic growth for July and August 2022 was approximately 8.3% (after agency charges) and believe that the overall EBITDA for July and August 2022 will be in line with that of the same months in 2021. _This preliminary information is based on internal management accounts and has been prepared by our management.

The Issuer holds 99.90% of the share capital of the Company, with the remaining 0.10% of the share capital being held by senior management of the Company. See “Principal Shareholders.” In the future, we may report our financial results at the level of the Lux Topco on a consolidated basis. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” (2) The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—The Offering—Security,”rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement, rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its subsidiaries (including obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by property or assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such obligation or indebtedness, and be structurally subordinated to any indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Issuer (including obligations to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Notes. ----- (3) The gross proceeds of the Offering will be used, together with borrowings under the New Senior Term Loan and cash on the Issuer’s balance sheet, to partially repay the Existing Senior Term Loan. See “Use of Proceeds.” (4) The Senior Facilities are comprised of the Senior Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Facility. On or about the Issue Date, we expect to amend the Senior Facilities Agreement to provide for borrowings of €432.7 million under the New Senior Term Loan, which will be used, together with the proceeds of the Offering, to partially repay the Existing Senior Term Loan, resulting in the Existing Senior Term Loan remaining outstanding in a residual amount of €350.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for €200.0 million of borrowings (including any permitted ancillary facilities established thereunder) in certain specified currencies and any other currencies readily available in the relevant interbank market (subject to the consent of the relevant lenders), subject to customary borrowing conditions, and is expected to be undrawn on the Issue Date. The Senior Facilities are secured by firstpriority security interests in the Issue Date Collateral, and no later than 120 days following the Issue Date, and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Post-Completion Date Collateral and be guaranteed by the Guarantors. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” (5) On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. No later than 120 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. The Note Guarantees will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and other certain contractual and legal limitations, and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—Your rights as a creditor may not be as favorable under the insolvency laws of France, Spain and Belgium as compared to the insolvency laws of the United States or other jurisdictions and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees—The Note Guarantee Release.” See also “The Offering—Note Guarantees.” The Guarantors accounted_ for 79.4% of the Group’s revenue and 79.3% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 83.9% of the Group’s total assets as of June 30, 2022. (6) Certain subsidiaries of the Issuer will not guarantee the Notes. As of June 30, 2022, the Issuer’s subsidiaries that are not expected to guarantee the Notes had approximately €2.1 million in outstanding third-party debt. In addition, any of the debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees. (7) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Issuer made an intercompany loan to the Company in an amount of €535.6 million, which was used to repay certain existing indebtedness of the Company (the “Company Proceeds Loan”). The Issuer’s receivables under the Company Proceeds Loan will form part of the Issue Date Collateral. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

(1) We define Acquisition Adjusted Revenue as revenue, adjusted as though the Acquired Companies had been acquired as of January 1, 2019, instead of the actual dates on which the acquisitions occurred or were deemed to have occurred for accounting purposes. (2) We define Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted as though the Acquired Companies had been acquired as of January 1, 2019, instead of the actual dates on which the acquisitions occurred or were deemed to have occurred for accounting purposes. (3) We define organic revenue growth as the percentage growth in Group revenue between two periods whereby: (i) for the periods 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016, the revenues used for the calculation are the reported revenues for the two periods, as adjusted, for the subsequent period, (a) to exclude the revenue contribution of any entity acquired in that period and (b) to exclude the revenue contribution of entities acquired in the prior period to the extent of the corresponding period prior to acquisition;, (ii) for the periods 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, the revenue used for the calculation is our reported revenue, as adjusted to (a) include the revenue contribution of entities acquired in the year ended December 31, 2016 (on a pro forma basis as if the acquisitions were completed on January 1, 2016) and (b) exclude the revenue contribution of entities acquired on or after January 1, 2017; and (iii) for the period 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, the revenue used for the calculation is our reported revenue, as adjusted to include (a) the revenue contribution of IECISA on a pro forma basis, as if the acquisition was completed on January 1, 2019 and (b) exclude the revenue contribution of all other entities acquired on or after January 1, 2019. (4) We define Adjusted EBITDA as net consolidated income before provisions for depreciation on working capital and risks, income tax expense, other financial income (expenses), cost of gross debt, income from cash and cash equivalents, other operating income and expenses, gains (losses) on disposals, restructuring costs, amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions and amortization (other than goodwill). ----- We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful metric for investors to understand our results of operations and profitability because it permits investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from underlying operating activities. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-IFRS Measure and the term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, the use of Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with IFRS. When assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance or liquidity measure that is calculated in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and _Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures.”_ The following table sets forth the reconciliation from net consolidated income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

While we believe that we operate in attractive markets, our performance depends in large part on the financial health and strength of our customers, which in turn is dependent on the general economies of the countries in which they operate. Our activities are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including particular downturns and inflationary cycles. In particular, demand for our services and solutions depends principally on investments in platforms that combine technology and specialized proprietary content and on the consumption of these platforms by private companies and government bodies. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in rising interest rates, inflation or unemployment, or more generally resulting in a deterioration of the economic situation in the markets in which we operate, could have a material adverse impact on us, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, any deterioration in economic conditions may affect customer spending, which may also have negative effects on our financial performance. Certain of our contracts with customers may provide for fixed pricing rates for the services and solutions to be provided, a cap on pricing or other terms which we negotiate based on our assumptions regarding our customers’required scope of services, costs that will be incurred to fulfill the scope and operational efficiencies we expect to achieve and other estimates. As a result, while we seek to pass on our costs to our customers, this may not be feasible in all situations.

Any negative trend in any industry vertical in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, we are dependent on the Financial Services and Public Sector and Healthcare industry verticals, which represented 49.7% of our revenue in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, which are often subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, consolidation, increasing capital requirements, lower transaction volumes in certain markets and asset classes and relatively low overall anticipated market growth. This complex regulatory environment often leads to periods of reductions in costs and reduced supplier spending in the industry, although it simultaneously increases compliance and risk-management concerns, which may benefit our business.

For example, if the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us, or from whom we seek credit commitments in the future, were to be adversely affected by conditions in the capital and credit markets, they might be unable to fund borrowings under such credit commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for capital expenditure, working capital, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Unfavorable market conditions could also make it difficult for our customers to obtain the financing they need for their projects on reasonable terms, which may reduce demand for our services and solutions or may hinder our customers’ ability to meet their payment obligations to us, increasing losses on bad debt. Delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. See “—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Any _delay or failure in payment for our services by customers who represent a large percentage of our trade receivables balance could adversely affect our business. Additionally, an increase in our trade receivable and in our provisions for bad debt, may negatively affect our working capital and lead us to experience liquidity constraints.” Our_ third-party providers may also be adversely impacted by unfavorable capital and credit markets, causing disruptions to our business operations. Political uncertainty may also negatively impact the capital and credit markets. For example, changes in foreign policy or regulatory requirements, trade restrictions or sanctions, higher tariffs and changes to existing, or the imposition of additional, regulations relating to the import or export of products. In particular, global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops occurred, leading to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, including, but not limited to, agreement to remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Additional sanctions and penalties have since been implemented, with further measures having been proposed and/or threatened. Although the length and long-term impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine has led and could continue to lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, severe inflation, as well as supply chain interruptions for some of our third-party suppliers. We have no activities or operations in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. However, if the conflict intensifies or expands beyond Ukraine, it could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, political uncertainty could also increase currency exchange fluctuations and volatility. Our main functional currency and reporting currency (for over 90% of our revenue and expenses) is the euro. However, we offer our services and solutions in various countries and, as a result, may be subject to some translation risk. The expansion of our international activities, including through our recent acquisitions, may increase our exposure to these currency exchange fluctuations.

Credit risk in these countries and in other Eurozone countries could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual euro Member States. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and tensions in North Africa and Eastern Europe and other world events could adversely affect the economies of the European Union and those of other countries. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Commission and Member States to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe, the overall stability of the Eurozone, the influx of refugees in certain European countries and the rise of populism in Europe. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including inflation, a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. See “—The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our ----- _business, results of operations and financial condition” and “—Unfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets and political uncertainty may adversely affect business conditions and our access to credit needed to maintain and grow our business.”_ The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the euro as a currency, could have major negative effects on our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely affect the economy in France, Iberia and BeLux, which represented 41.2%, 35.2% and 14.0%, respectively, of our revenue in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The potentially severe impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could also have a negative impact on the value and marketability of the Notes. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership within the European Union, the result of which favored the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (“Brexit”). Following such referendum and the enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement, which was ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on April 28, 2021 and applies permanently since May 1, 2021, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among others. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Since we rely on access to the financial markets in order to refinance our debt liabilities and gain access to new financing, ongoing political uncertainty and any worsening of the economic environment may reduce our ability to refinance our existing and future liabilities or gain access to new financing, in each case on favorable terms or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The outbreak and continued spread of the COVID-19 virus and variants thereof (the “COVID-19 pandemic”), and the measures taken to attempt to contain and mitigate its effects, including stay-at-home, business closure and other restrictive orders, and the resulting changes in customer behavior, have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations, and those of our customers. This led to a slowdown in business investment and may lead to a drop in activity for our business and prevent us from achieving our goals, particularly as we were unevenly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic across our geographies, with France being the most impacted country where our revenue decreased by 8.3% between the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020. However, the strong reduction in infections and deaths recorded in recent months, facilitated by the successful outcome of the vaccination campaign, has allowed the reopening of many sectors severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and is gradually bringing the economy closer to pre-pandemic levels. According to the Banque de France, the recovery of the French economy in 2022 as the COVID-19 pandemic draws to a close remains solid. However, this projected recovery may be negatively impacted by deteriorating general economic conditions due to, among other things, rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and pressures on public finances, all of which may be exacerbated by geopolitical threats, including the current conflict in Ukraine. See “—Unfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets and _political uncertainty may adversely affect business conditions and our access to credit needed to maintain and grow our business.” The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations_ and financial condition will depend on developments beyond our control. A resurgence in infections in certain areas of the world may result in the implementation of new restrictions and while vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 are progressing, there can be no assurance on if and ----- when the population will be fully immunized, including as a result of new strains of the virus which may be characterized by higher transmission rates. Therefore, it remains unclear if or when the COVID-19 pandemic will cease and whether previously lifted measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may be reinstated. Any potential impact on our results will therefore depend on, to a large extent, future developments, including new variants of the virus, and the impact of the virus on our customers’ businesses as well as new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19, the pace of vaccination in various countries in which we operate, the pace and extent of the resumption of normal economic and operating conditions, the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that ultimately results from the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that the fallout from various governments’ attempts to contain the spread of COVID-19 worldwide will not have material consequences for the holders of indebtedness, including the Notes. The pandemic or any similar event could affect demand for our services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk _Factors” section, such as those relating to our indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to_ service our indebtedness (including the Notes), and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness. If the COVID-19 pandemic leads to continued or renewed shutdowns or if economic disruptions from COVID-19 continue, demand for our services and our revenue may be negatively affected. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there were a number of government measures introduced, including in our key markets of France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, which positively contributed to the Group’s ability to manage cash flows during the period and manage the costs associated with our in-house employees and job candidates. A number of these measures, however, have ended during the course of 2021 or will end in the near future. For example, we utilized temporary unemployment measures introduced that have allowed us to retain certain in-house employees and job candidates without bearing the full expense of their wages and salaries and have utilized certain postponement of VAT or other tax and benefit payments. As the remaining government measures expire and without the introduction of additional government measures, we could experience additional costs and liabilities and may also find it more difficult to retain in-house employees and job candidates if demand for our staffing services reduces due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in the markets in which we operate. If any of the foregoing were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.2.1,The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.,"We operate in the IT services market, offering our services and solutions to customers across seven activities: Application Services, Business Solutions, Infrastructure Services, Value-Added Reselling, Outsourcing, Consulting and Software Solutions. The French, Iberian and Belgian IT services markets represent our key markets and accounted for 41.2%, 35.2% and 13.1% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. We have operating subsidiaries in 29 countries, grouped into five geographic areas: France, Iberia, BeLux, LatAm and Other (which encompasses all other countries in which we operate in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa). The IT services markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to continuous change. We believe that the principal competitive factors in these markets are service quality, speed in providing services requested by customers, overseeing our insourcing processes, technical and industry expertise, price, talent recruitment and retention, innovation, established relationships with key customers (often on a local level), proximity to customers, knowledge of the regulatory framework, and the ability to add value to a customer’s business. We compete for business with a variety of players, including large multinational firms and many local players that provide consulting, technology and/or business process services, in-house services, software services companies that also provide business process services and accounting firms that also provide IT consulting services. As a part of our Applications Services and Infrastructure Services activities, our offering includes digitization and robotic process automation (“RPA”) and AI-assisted development, multi-modal IT management services, design and implementation of hybrid cloud journeys and data exploitation services for businesses, along with a broad suite of hardware and software offerings. Especially in relation to these services, our competition includes large systems integrators and resellers, other value-added resellers, manufacturers who sell directly to end users and boutique solutions providers. In addition, the trend toward international expansion by IT service providers and continued technological changes may result in new and different ----- competitors entering our markets. These competitors may include both entrants from other industries, such as the communications, software and data networking industries or entrants from geographic locations with lower labor and production costs than in France and the other markets where we operate. Our main competitors include French, Spanish, Portuguese and large and global multinational players, such as Accenture, Capgemini, Atos, as well as local ones such as Indra, Devoteam, Orange and Sopra Steria. Some of our competitors may benefit from greater economies of scale, have greater financial, marketing, technological or other resources, larger customer bases and better-established reputations in our markets than we do. As a result, some of these competitors may be able to: - more efficiently or more rapidly develop superior services or solutions, gain greater market acceptance and expand their service offerings; - more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; - bundle services with other services they provide at reduced prices; - adopt more aggressive pricing policies, offer more favorable terms and devote greater resources to the promotion, marketing and sales of their products or services, which could cause us to have to lower prices for certain services and solutions to remain competitive in the market; - devote greater resources to the research and development of their services and solutions; and - better withstand adverse market conditions. In addition to competing with large players, such as Accenture, with whom we compete principally in terms of flexibility and proximity to customers, we also compete with a number of small and regional players, with whom we compete in terms of the depth and breadth of our offering and the scale on which we can deliver our services and solutions. Increased competition may also result in lower prices and volumes, higher costs for resources, especially personnel, higher costs for R&D programs and lower profitability. As a result, we may not be able to supply customers with services that they deem superior at competitive prices, may be unable to continue to attract new customers and may lose market share to our competitors. Additionally, our customers may choose to implement or use services and solutions developed by our or partners rather than services and solutions developed by us. If this occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to the lower margins that we generate when customers choose to do so. Any inability to face increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing, AI, digitalization and the processing and analysis of large and unstructured data (so-called “Big Data”analytics). Our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate these advances develop our strategic and technical expertise, influence and respond in a timely manner to emerging industry standards and trends and develop tailored new product and service offerings to meet our customers’ evolving needs. To remain competitive, we must continue to improve the responsiveness, functionality and reliability of our services and solutions and expand our existing technological and service offerings, as well as develop new services and solutions, including digitization, to keep pace with technological, regulatory and market developments as well as move up the value chain, by, among others, dedicating significant efforts and resources to our R&D activities.

Our operations in these countries are subject to the local legal, political and economic environments and are subject to local laws and regulations including relating to, among others, employment, tax, reporting and trade regulations. We may not be in compliance with all regulations in the countries in which we operate and may be subject to penalties and/or fines as a result. Each of these factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In the year ended December 31, 2021, our top ten customers generated 17.5% of our revenue and our top 35 customers generated 35.3% of our revenue. Our customers typically have no obligation to renew their contracts with us upon expiration, and even if they do, they may not renew with a similar contract period or with the same or a greater amount of committed revenue to us. See “Business—Customer Contracts.” In particular, our customers may decide not to renew their contracts with us, and in some cases terminate existing ones early or at their convenience, if they are dissatisfied with our services, our prices or the actual or perceived quality, durability or security of our services, solutions or platforms. Additionally, our success also depends on relationships we develop with our customers that enable us to understand our customers’ needs and deliver services and solutions that are tailored to meet those needs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with customers, and if we are not successful, we may lose important sales opportunities, customers and market share. Since we usually provide our customers with a combination of services and solutions, the loss of a major customer, or a significant reduction in volume of business from an existing major customer, for instance as a result of such customer being dissatisfied with the quality of our work, our failure to meet performance standards under our contracts, our failure to inform the customer of our full service offerings, ineffective cross-selling or up-selling, or our non-compliance with the provisions of our contractual agreements or applicable regulatory requirements, may result in our inability to sell additional services to such customer, the loss of business volume from such customer or the loss of the customer altogether, leading to our inability to grow our business as anticipated. In addition, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could cause a reduction in business volume from a customer or the loss of a customer, including reduced technology spending in response to a challenging economic or competitive environment, consolidation, business or financial deterioration or failure and, in the case of public sector contracts, a decrease in public IT spending appropriations. If any of these events were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

In general, system implementation, migrations and integrations can be impacted by unforeseen challenges in delivering services and solutions on time and to budget. Due to the length and complexity of some implementations and the ongoing evolution of product cycles, we may face unforeseen issues with service deliveries that can have an adverse impact on customer satisfaction and profitability. If our customers are dissatisfied with the quality of our services and decide to terminate the integration of our services and solutions with their existing systems, we may incur costs that we would not be able to offset with revenue we were expecting to generate from such services. If we do not provide effective or timely ongoing support, our ability to sell additional services to existing customers or our ability to retain such customers may be adversely affected and our reputation within the market, including with potential customers, could be damaged. In addition, support for the majority of our services and solutions can be provided by third parties, and our failure to meet our customers’ expectations may result in third parties capturing a portion of revenue streams generated from support operations on our services and solutions. In addition, to the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training and retaining adequate support resources, our ability to provide adequate and timely support and maintenance services to ----- our customers will be negatively impacted, and our customers’ satisfaction with our services may be adversely affected. Our failure to provide and maintain high-quality support and maintenance services could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The rates we are able to charge for our services and solutions are affected by a number of factors, including: - general economic, political and market conditions; - customers’ perceptions of our ability to add value through our services; - our customers’ desire or need to control or reduce their costs; - the general competitive environment in our industry (including new competitors entering the market); - the introduction of new services and solutions by us or our competitors; - public appropriations for IT spending; and - the procurement practices of customers and their use of third-party advisors. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is also dependent on our capacity to successfully manage our costs, including staff costs, which accounted for 60.1% of our total costs included in our operating margin during the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity, including staff utilization levels. We have implemented and continue to implement new remote-working policies in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have incurred and continue to incur substantial costs in relation to such policies, which may increase going forward. Finally, our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. We sell a large part of our services on a fixed-price basis (projects and services). These services are subject to contracts with firm commitments in terms of price, deadline, compliance, safely, quality and performance targets and an incorrect assessment of the contractual scope could lead to significant additional costs. If we were to underestimate the production effort or the complexity of the services and solutions that we need to provide, we could fail to deliver the project in accordance with contractual conditions, or deliver it with significant additional production costs, affecting its margin. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a customer’s satisfaction, our contracts could generate lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, an increase in our trade receivable and in our provisions for bad debt, may negatively affect our working capital and lead us to experience liquidity constraints.","From time to time, we carry significant trade receivables balances from customers that generate a large portion of our revenue. While we closely monitor timely payment of our trade receivables, a customer may become unable or unwilling to pay its balance on time due to, among other reasons, an economic weakness in its industry or the financial insolvency of its business. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top ten customers generated 17.5% of our revenue and our days sales outstanding (“DSOs”) in trade receivables were 41 days. As of June 30, 2022, our DSOs increased to 58 days. Any increase in our DSOs due to delays in payments could negatively impact our liquidity. To manage our liquidity needs, particularly during peak periods, we regularly enter into non-recourse factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables from customers, which are not committed. As of June 30, 2022, the amount of non-recourse factored receivables outstanding excluded from our financial statements was €142.8 million. Moreover, should the French or any other economy where we have geographic presence experience economic volatility or tightening credit markets, the risk that we may not be able to collect payments on a timely basis from our customers could increase. For example, a deterioration of economic conditions in France and ----- Europe, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by our customers. In addition, we account for possible write-downs of our trade receivables from customers through the creation of a bad debt provision. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we had bad debt provisions with respect to receivables from customers, of €16.3 million, €41.7 million and €43.6 million, respectively. If our bad debts increase significantly, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this may have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows. See “—Risks Related to the Macroeconomic, Political and Social Environment—The impact of COVID-19 and _related risks could materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_ In addition, if we decide to engage in sales of our trade receivables in the future, the potentially impaired credit worthiness of our customers in light of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it more difficult or costly for us to do so, which could in turn harm our liquidity position to the extent other credit lines will not be available at that time for any reasons. More generally, delays in payments by our largest customers, requests for modifications to their contractual payment arrangements or defaults on their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Certain of our targeted cost savings initiatives may require us to make internal operational changes, which could offset the anticipated benefits of such initiatives or cause delays, or require the cooperation of our customers or suppliers, which is outside of our control. Our anticipated cost savings initiatives are also subject to a number of assumptions about the costs associated with realizing such cost savings, and we expect to incur substantial one-off costs to achieve such cost savings, which may be higher than what we expect and therefore offset a portion of our expected savings in the near term.

We rely on IT systems and applications to develop and maintain our digital services and solutions and run our day-to-day operations and our success largely depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our technical infrastructure in order to provide services to our customers. Our service contracts include service level commitments, which determine the levels of service expected by our customers and provides the metrics by which service is measured for various purposes, including our compensation under such contracts. In particular, we are dependent on the uninterrupted performance of our IT infrastructure, which we rely on for our operations and our ability to offer services to our customers. We also rely on uninterrupted access to the wider power and telecommunications network, and any significant failure, damage or destruction of the basic infrastructure such as power and telecommunications systems in the locations in which we operate, could affect the quality of our services and cause service interruption. Our infrastructure may be damaged in natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or fires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters due to wars or terrorist attacks, or be subject to damage or compromise from human error, technical disruptions, unauthorized access, sabotage or intentional acts of vandalism, power failure, computer glitches and viruses, software defects, telecommunications failures, adverse weather conditions and other unforeseen events. Any of such events may cause disruptions to information systems for sustained periods, result in system interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or deterioration in their performance, which could impair our ability to operate our business. As many of our services play a business-critical role for our customers, any damage to or failure of the infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services for our customers in a timely manner or to maintain certain customers’ service level requirements. Enhancing our IT systems and applications to achieve improved stability and redundancy, as well as putting in place remedies to resolve a disruption or other interruption of our IT services, may be time-consuming and ----- expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain. If we are unable to invest in maintaining and improving our IT systems and applications, the likelihood of the occurrence of system interruptions may increase. While we have developed certain contingency and disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, such plans and systems might not be fully redundant or sufficient. Our IT infrastructure redundancy mechanisms could fail, resulting in damages, data loss, service interruptions and other disruptions of our IT systems and applications, any of which could severely affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, our property damage insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairing the damage caused from such disruptive events or such events may only partially be covered under our policies or not at all. If we are unable to operate our business as a result of any significant or sustained interruption of our technical infrastructure could have a negative effect on our services and result in damages for breach of contract, litigation, reputational damage and could ultimately result in the loss of current and/or potential customers or in reduced business from current customers which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, for our cloud-based services and solutions, the infrastructure on which such offers run is owned and operated by third-party service providers, such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Snowflake, Next Step, OVHcloud and Sage. Any interruptions or other disruptions affecting the systems or servers operated by such providers would adversely affect our cloud business and, consequently, the business of our customers, which could harm our reputation and lead to customer claims and litigation.

Customers often view these commitments as significant strategic decisions and, as a result, may require time to evaluate, test and qualify our services and solutions prior to entering into or expanding a relationship with us. Our sales force develops relationships directly with our customers, focusing on account penetration, account coordination, sales and overall market development. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts and there can be no assurance that our efforts will produce a sale. Purchases of digital platforms are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed and when revenue from such sale will be recognized. Moreover, during the sales evaluation period, such prospective customers may delay purchases, may decide not to purchase and may scale down proposed orders for reasons that we do not control and cannot predict, including: - changes in economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and political uncertainty or any other economic, social and political factors described in this “Risk Factors” section); - changes in customer personnel; - changes in cybersecurity requirements; - introduction of new services and solutions by our competitors; - lower prices offered by our competitors for similar services and solutions; - changes in the budgets and purchasing priorities of our customers; - need for education of customer personnel; - changes in the information systems of our customers; and - changes in regulation. In addition, sales to larger customers as opposed to smaller customers may increase the amount of time and resources spent on our sales efforts and we may face competition from companies that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such customers, which could decrease our chances of being chosen by such customers.

In particular, large and complex projects often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including of our partners. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their services and solutions in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance.

Since 2016, we have completed more than 25 acquisitions. Some of these acquisitions were significant, including the acquisitions of, among others, Roff in 2016, Gesfor in 2017, Realdolmen in 2018, SIS in 2019, IECISA in 2020, Ilex International in 2021 and JCommerce and HLi Consulting in 2022. Despite our successful track record of acquisitions and integration of new businesses into our operations, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to be able to successfully identify suitable acquisitions, generate expected margins or cash flows or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or complete any particular acquisition, combination or other transaction on acceptable terms, which could prevent us from achieving our strategic goals. Our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing or its conditions, debt covenants, complex ownership structures among potential targets and government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers. There can be no assurance that our assessments and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. In addition, our debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future acquisitions, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to finance our overall operations and pay interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes. ----- Any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our day-to-day business and divert management’s attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of such businesses may prove to be more difficult than we initially anticipated and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted in response of such pandemic. Integrations can be difficult and unpredictable also as a result of the complexity of software and due to the fact that acquired technologies are typically developed independently and may not have been designed to integrate with our services and solutions. Such difficulties are compounded when the services and solutions involved are well-established, as compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved, and/or when the size of the acquired business is significant as compared to our size. Successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams, which could be difficult and unpredictable due to cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. Acquisitions also pose certain other risks, for example, difficulties or delays in consolidating operations and achieving anticipated synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, growth, operational efficiencies and other benefits, diversion of managerial resources away from our day-to-day business operations, overpayment for the acquired business, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to the extent that we issue new shares to fund an acquisition and the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed risks. Certain contracts of the businesses acquired by us may contain “change of control” provisions that require the acquired company to notify the counterparty of a potential change of control, or contain language that could be interpreted as allowing, subject to certain conditions, the counterparty to terminate the contract. If a substantial number of these contracts have been, are or will be terminated as a result of our acquisition, we may be forced to enter into new contracts on less favorable terms, or we may be unable to secure replacements. While we strive to mitigate unexpected liabilities and risks through contractual protections in our acquisition documentation, we cannot ensure that such protections will be effective. In addition, if we enter into an acquisition agreement but the acquisition is not consummated, we may be liable for break-up fees or other payments, which may, in some cases, be material and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Competitive bidding, including when required by some private parties, imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including, the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us, and the need to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to implement and service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope and design and to consider such estimated resources and costs in the context of a competitive tender process in order to submit a price quote that is competitive but not so low as to be loss-making if we win the bid, and the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts that we might otherwise pursue. Over the past few years, and mostly for central government activities, there has been a shift in the manner public administration and healthcare tenders are run, from a fragmented approach, whereby the relevant local public administration or other public entity launches a local tender to satisfy its individual IT services requirements, to a more integrated approach, whereby centralized purchasing agencies consolidate the purchasing function of the individual public administration organizations through the execution of framework agreements. Public authorities may, from time to time, audit our public tenders. For example, we and certain other providers of IT services are currently under investigation by the Basque Competition Authority for allegations of bid-rigging practices in connection with eight public tender offers with a total value of €2.4 million that we submitted to the Basque Government Informatic Society (EJIE) in 2021. The investigation is in its early stages with no material findings to date.

Projects involving governments or governmental agencies carry various risks inherent in the government contracting process, including the following: - government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding, at their convenience, or in case of any change in the applicable law. Centralization of public spending decisions and other changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination; - terms and conditions of contracts with public sector entities tend to be more onerous than other contracts and may include, among others, extensive rights of audit, more punitive service-level penalties and other restrictive covenants; - contractual non-compliance (including improper billing), failure to comply with procurement regulations and regulation regarding the protection of classified information, and other improper or illegal activities, may result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, in addition to other typical remedies for breach of contract, which may include termination of the relevant contracts, forfeiture of profits and suspension of payments; - government contracts are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other contracts. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect our business and reputation; - participation in government contracts could subject us to stricter regulatory requirements, which may increase our cost of compliance; - political and economic factors, such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision-makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenue, can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid for, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed; - government contracts may involve multiple parties in the delivery of services and require greater project management efforts on our part, and any failure in this regard may adversely impact our performance and reputation; - litigation or disputes with government and public entities may lead to us being banned from contracting with other government and public entities or participating in public tenders, which would have both an economic and a reputational impact on us; and - public sector-related customers sometimes follow payment management processes that are subject to review by other government authorities or other entities, which may cause delays or adjustments to their own payment schedule.

Such guarantees, including performance bonds and bid bonds, represented €139.5 million as of June 30, 2022, as compared to €117.0 million as of December 31, 2021, €84.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and €12.1 million as of December 31, 2019. Some of these bonds and guarantees include cross-default provisions which could be triggered if we default under other bonds and guarantees, which could amplify the impact of a default under these instruments. If our customers were to enforce the bonds, including as a result of our default or alleged default under any applicable terms and conditions, laws or regulations, we were required to post at the time of the relevant contract or tender, we could be subject to payment obligations, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, we generated 22.6% of our revenue from the Financial Services industry vertical. Our results of operations rely on our capacity to retain customers in such industries and our capacity to continue to provide them with the IT services and digital solutions that they require. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Adverse trends in the banking and financial services industries, such as an economic downturn, consolidation in the sector granting certain of our customers increased bargaining power, or increased regulation of the contracts, IT services and digital solutions used in the banking and financial services industry could result in reduced demand for our IT services and digital solutions, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Furthermore, certain of our business units work with a number of large corporate customers and are sometimes required to adhere to their standard terms and conditions. As a result of the foregoing, we are exposed to legal risks whenever such contracts contain drafting errors, execution errors (including unsigned agreements), lack sufficient detail on the nature of our liability to the customer, require customized terms and conditions, or require additional analysis as to legal sufficiency. Such general terms and conditions, standard contracts and forms used and signed by us may not comply with all the applicable legal requirements at all times.

As a result, we may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized use of our property, unauthorized entry or breach of security protocols, negligence, willful misconduct or other tortious acts by our employees or people who have gained unauthorized access to premises through us. Such claims may be substantial and may result in adverse publicity for us. Moreover, conducting our business in an ethical manner is important to our reputation, status with regulators and business prospects. Any contact by our directors, employees, agents or partners with third parties, including the public administration (including in the context of participations in auctions, interactions held ----- with the public administration in the process of obtaining or renewing any authorization or license and any possible public contribution) involves risks associated with fraud, bribery, corruption, incorrect use of public contributions and other fraudulent activities committed by our directors, employees and third parties acting on our behalf. We are also exposed to the risk that our directors, employees or agents commit IT-related crimes, which may consist of using our infrastructure to violate the IT systems of our competitors, unlawful access to banking data (including that of our customers) and damage the IT systems and documents. In addition, we may be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized use of our property, unauthorized entry or breach of security protocols, negligence, willful misconduct or other tortious acts by our employees or people who have gained unauthorized access to premises operated by us through us. Such claims may be substantial and may result in adverse publicity for us. Individual employees may act against our instructions and either inadvertently or deliberately violate laws or internal policies. Our business activities may also involve risks related to possible accidents, which may be due to our employees’ activities or mistakes and may consist in crimes, breaches of security measures or damages to third parties. In particular, we must comply with certain anti-corruption laws, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism or other similar regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For instance, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the French law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life (more widely known as the “Sapin II Law”) and other similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. We operate, or may decide to enter, countries that have legal and regulatory systems that are different than the one in France and in which corruption may occur more frequently and to a greater extent than in France. Under some circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but despite our compliance policies and training efforts, we can provide no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us, particularly from acts committed by our employees or third parties. Consequences for violating anti-corruption laws, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism or other similar regulations can be significant and can entail significant reputational damage. Further, due to the international nature of our operations, we may use local agents or subcontractors to understand unfamiliar environments and differences in cultural, legal, financial and accounting complexities and obligations, or to carry out a portion of the activities called for by a particular contract. There is a risk that such agents or subcontractors may be involved in illegal or unethical activities in local markets that are unknown to us. If we fail to adequately supervise them or maintain an adequate compliance program, we may be liable for their actions. Similarly, our customers and suppliers may be involved in activities that our onboarding and diligence procedures may be unable to detect and that may put us at risk for non-compliance with anti-corruption and similar laws.

Our internal contracting policy provides that our contracts must include a cap on direct damage indemnification and prohibits the inclusion of clauses that could lead to indemnification of indirect or consequential losses. In addition, our agreements with contractors also include provisions requiring such contractors to enter into ----- suitable insurance. We may not always be able to accurately foresee all activities and situations in order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our insurance policies and, as a result, our insurance may not cover such risks adequately or at all. In addition, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future and it is unclear if, and how, our insurance policies will cover any damages that we may suffer in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, certain categories of risks are currently not insurable at reasonable cost, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and there can be no assurance of the financial abilities of the insurance companies to meet their claim payment obligations. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable and we may experience incidents of a nature that are not covered by insurance. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. This risk is increased as a result of our frequent acquisitions, as entities that we acquire from to time may not have internal control procedures of an effectiveness equivalent to ours.

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity,13.3.1,Cybersecurity issues could impact our business.,"We operate in the IT services market and, as part of our business, we collect and retain large volumes of data, including financial, personally identifying and other sensitive information, pertaining to us, our customers and personnel and our customers’customers and personnel. Our IT systems record, process, store, summarize and report such data. Our and our customers’ collection and use of this data might raise privacy and security concerns and negatively impact our business or the demand for our services and solutions. We are therefore dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate internally and with our customers, partners and vendors. As the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the increased use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services in recent years, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. Such breaches and cyberattacks could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data of, among others, our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and other business partners, as well as personal data stored through our services and solutions or through our services by our customers, which may result in damage to our reputation and brand and adversely affect our relationships with our customers. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and have increased in sophistication and speed in recent years, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns which required the use of new digital tools and entailed a significant increase in persons working outside their ordinary work environments, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against these threats. There is a growing trend of advanced persistent threats being launched by organized and coordinated groups against corporate networks to breach security for malicious purposes. Computer hackers may also be able to develop and deploy computer viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that could attack our services and solutions, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our services and solutions, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our customers and its customers. Furthermore, these risks will increase as we continue to expand our cloud product offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers’confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers’businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data. We also have acquired a number of companies, technologies, services and solutions and over the years and, while we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to such acquisitions, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these acquisitions within our business. The risk of cyber-attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own services, solutions and systems, but also of those of our customers, employees, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal ----- information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. Furthermore, certain industries in which our customers operate, including the healthcare, finance, defense and security industries, require heightened standards for the handling of sensitive data and can be subject to regulatory overview, which can result in an increase in our compliance expenses and negative publicity for our services and solutions in case of a breach or attempted breach. In the event of such actions, we, our customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as to the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. We also experience and respond to cybersecurity threats from time to time. On December 19, 2021, we were targeted by a ransomware attack, affecting some of our operations in France. We isolated the affected operational sites to limit any spread of the virus and protect our customers, employees and partners. As a result, no main infrastructure was compromised and the consequences on turnover were limited. We also set-up a crisis unit which has not detected further material abnormal activity. As our business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. However, there can be no assurance that such investments will prevent future cyberattacks or other threats from occurring which may result in material adverse effects on our business and operations. In addition, the trend to publicize vulnerabilities discovered in our industry increases the risks posed by these attacks and the potential costs that we, our partners and/or our customers might have to incur to respond and remediate to any of such attacks.

Development work is subject to various risks, including the possible delay of scheduled market launches. For example, the measures adopted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote working, may delay the development of new services and solutions and therefore the market launch of such offering. Additionally, new services and solutions may fail to satisfy our quality standards, meet market needs or the expectations of customers, or comply with regulatory requirements. Digital services and solutions also frequently contain errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. If we are not able to rectify such errors or meet the expectations of our customers in a timely manner, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our customers use our digital services and solutions for critical aspects of their business and any errors, defects or other performance problems with our services and solutions may adversely affect our customers’ businesses and we might be faced with customer claims for cash refunds, damages, replacement software, or other concessions. Moreover, if our customers experience a defect or a delay in product upgrade, especially if linked to new regulations, they may decide not to renew contractual arrangements relating to our services and solutions or may delay or withhold payment of assistance and maintenance fees. Furthermore, defects or bugs might also impact the installation and start-up of new services and solutions to our existing customers or new customers, in which case our customers may delay or withhold the payment of licenses and delivery services. Additionally, the detection and correction of software errors and security flaws can be timeconsuming and costly and we may be required to divert resources away from development projects to remedy defects in new or already-existing digital services and solutions.

Typically, while our customers are mostly blue-chip accounts with no significant cash collection issues, our billing cycle and the recognition of revenue in our income statement remain subject to slight variations. Our operating margin is generally higher in the second half of the year, driven mostly by (i) an improvement in our activity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of days worked during the relevant period to the number of Potential Days (“Potential Days” corresponds to the number of Working Days multiplied by the number of Billable FTEs, excluding vacation days and certain other days of inactivity; “Working Days” corresponds to the number of business days in a year (i.e., excluding weekends and bank holidays); and “Billable FTEs” includes front-office employees (i.e., consultants)), (ii) the release of project and bonus provisions at the end of the year and (iii) the contribution of license revenue in the second half of the year. These drivers cause differences in our revenue among the various quarters of any financial year, which means that the individual quarters of a year may not be directly compared with each other or used to predict annual financial results. If we do not effectively manage our working capital, by ensuring that alternative sources of capital or cash are available to address our working capital needs, especially in the third quarter of each year, our liquidity position, cash flows, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Typically the receipt of purchase orders from our customers, the date a contract is entered into and the beginning of the provision of services is spread over a period of time. Customers may terminate their contracts prior to execution thereof, in which case the costs we incurred prior to termination might not be entirely recoverable, if at all. Moreover, the internal budget and approval processes of our prospective customers make it difficult to predict the timing of new customer engagements. Also, since we mostly recognize revenue when the services are rendered, the financial benefit of gaining a new customer may not be realized at the intended time due to delays in the implementation of our services or to an increase in the start-up costs required in building our infrastructure. Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, may make it difficult for us to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that are not realized as a result of these delays, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Our goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment (or more frequently if events or circumstances, internal or external, indicate that a reduction in value is likely to have occurred), and our goodwill is not subject to amortization. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.

We own a number of trademarks and copyrights, and a limited number of patents, worldwide and have pending patent, trademark and copyright applications. We seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our services and solutions, or where obtaining such proprietary rights is possible and will improve our competitive position. However, French, EU and international intellectual property laws may not provide sufficient protection for our services and solutions, particularly since know-how, our most important intellectual property, cannot be adequately protected under intellectual property laws of these jurisdictions. Although know-how as such cannot be appropriated, its economic value can be preserved through copyright, patent or confidentiality and trade secret. As such, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property under the relevant legal regimes, as well as through contractual arrangements, all of which offer protection, provided that all relevant requirements for protection of each intellectual property assets are satisfied. However, our applications may not be granted, our existing protections may expire and we may fail to obtain such protections in the future. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may not be deterred from misuse, theft or misappropriation of them, including trade secrets and information that we regard as proprietary. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring or enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. In addition, our intellectual property may also be infringed by our employees through error or malfeasance. Employees may claim rights over our intellectual property or use our intellectual property to establish competing businesses or may disclose sensitive information regarding our digital services and solutions or our IT systems. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. ----- Moreover, potential actions taken to enforce our intellectual property rights, both in France and abroad, may not be effective and, in some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming. While we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property disputes, attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or take unilateral steps to invalidate our intellectual property rights, which could result in a holding or official action that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including copyrights and trade secrets on our software and technologies), we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to others who have not incurred the additional expense, time and effort which may be required to protect the innovative services and solutions that have enabled us to be successful to date. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our patents and other intellectual property, with particular reference to trade secrets, may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to or duplicative to ours.

In particular, we may be required to cease making, licensing or using products that allegedly infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights or misuse the confidential information of others, to expend additional development resources in an attempt to redesign our services and solutions or otherwise to develop alternative technology that does not infringe, misuse or misappropriate such intellectual property rights, or to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, confidential information or intellectual property rights. Defending against claims of infringement or being deemed to be infringing the intellectual property rights or misusing the confidential information of others, or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights, could, in each case, impair our ability to innovate, develop, distribute and sell our current and planned services and solutions, which could materially impact our operations. Moreover, any dispute or litigation regarding trademarks or other intellectual property right could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. In addition, even claims of infringement, misuse or misappropriation that ultimately are unsuccessful could cause reputational harm, result in litigation costs and divert management and key personnel’s time and other resources, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Our employees have specialized knowledge that is in high demand, and competition for suitably qualified individuals with the relevant technical expertise in our industry and in the locations in which we operate is intense and may increase as the demand for business process outsourcing services increases. Our R&D operations employ a dedicated team of researchers and data scientists who command high salaries and whose skills are in high demand from competitors. If we are unable to identify, attract, develop, motivate, adequately compensate and retain well-qualified and engaged personnel, or if existing highly skilled and specialized personnel leave us and successors or adequate replacements are not readily available, we may not be able to manage our operations effectively, which could cause us to suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our customers’demands, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have entered into non-compete and non-poaching agreements with certain of our managers and employees, such agreements may be deemed unenforceable by competent courts and tribunals allowing our competitors to hire and contract with such managers and employees.

For example, as a result of COVID-19 and in order to comply with the safety and health measures imposed by the French government, we incurred certain costs (including for COVID-19 tests). We may not manage to offset the increase in staff costs through productivity gains or other measures. If staff costs increase further, our operating costs will increase and we may be unable to recover these increased costs from our customers through increased selling prices or offset them through productivity gains or other measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

In the countries in which we operate, labor laws generally provide for strong protection of employees’ interests, which may be at odds with the interests of our business. In addition, many of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by works councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in connection with managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business. Although we believe our relations with our employees are generally positive, our operations may be materially affected by strikes, work-stoppages, work-slowdowns or other labor-related developments or labor disputes in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our employees benefit from collective bargaining agreements, and we may not be able to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our labor costs, productivity and flexibility. Likewise, many of our suppliers and customers have unionized work forces.

Likewise, many of the industries in which our customers operate, including the financial, government, healthcare and technology, media and telecommunication and defense and security industries, are subject to such extensive, complex, costly and evolving laws and regulations. We may take into account such regulations for the provision of certain of our services, as well as the development of some of our services and solutions, including our proprietary IP software for our public sector customers and our digital solutions. In addition, in providing IT services and digital solutions to our customers, we often process, collect and store personal data of customers, business partners, employees, third parties and others (including, among others, name, address, age, and bank details) as part of the ordinary course of our business operations. We are therefore subject to data protection and privacy legislation, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”). Such laws and regulations restrict our ability to collect, process and use personal data relating to customers, potential customers, business partners, and employees, including for marketing purposes. See “Business—Regulation.” In particular, the GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and was immediately binding across all Member States of the European Union, increased both the number and the restrictive nature of the obligations applicable to us, with a focus on the collection, processing, use and transfer of personal data. The GDPR requires European Union-based companies or companies that process personal data about European Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate to, for example, (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data ----- minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing and (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure. The GDPR requires companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties including fines of up to 4.0% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type, duration and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). We do not carry GDPR-specific insurance and we may not be able to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Finally, the European Commission has proposed to replace Directive 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “E-Privacy Directive”) with a new regulation primarily aimed at aligning certain provisions of the E-Privacy Directive to the GDPR. The Proposal for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “E-Privacy Regulation”) was published by the European Commission on January 10, 2017 and is currently under analysis before the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council. The draft E-Privacy Regulation proposes heightened regulatory requirements in connection with unsolicited communications, the use of cookies, security of personally identifiable information, confidentiality of communications, consent, data security and data integrity. In line with the GDPR, breaches of the E-Privacy Regulation may result in maximum fines equal to the greater of 4.0% of the annual global turnover of the sanctioned company or €20 million (whichever is higher). In addition, we are subject to a further level of regulation primarily arising under the applicable regulatory provisions in the field of cybersecurity, including (as applicable) Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on cybersecurity (the “NIS Directive”), as implemented at a national levels. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulations is relatively complex. We may not at all times be in compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings, investigations or other actions (including class actions) brought against us by governmental entities and agencies or private individuals and entities, which may result in significant fines, penalties, judgments and reputational damages to our business, and require us to change business practices and increase the costs and complexity of compliance, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, evolving regulation relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs and affect or limit the way through which we collect, process, use, store and transfer personal data. Compliance with, and monitoring of such laws and regulations is demanding, time consuming and costly. Further, such laws and regulations, including their interpretation and application, change from time to time, and such changes could impose new burdens and expose us to further liability, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, in the aftermath of temporary personnel initiatives implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as a reliance on remote working and an increased amount of employee health data being processed, our exposure to this risk is temporarily heightened. Any changes in these laws and regulations or procedural rules, such as those governing public procurement and tender processes, could reduce the profitability of our services and solutions and, in exceptional cases, could render the market introduction of a new product or service unprofitable. Any failure to comply with the applicable regulations, including by third-party licensees, partners and customers, could result in fines, enforcement actions by governments or competent authorities, injunctions or other measures, which could result in reputational harm, reduced sales and market share and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

We are currently involved in a number of disputes related to projects terminated by either our customers or ourselves. These procedures can become particularly complex, with the potential involvement of judicial experts and ----- other third parties to allocate damages between the parties and may also result in injunctive rulings that could require us to change certain of our practices. For a description of material ongoing legal proceedings, see “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In the aftermath of public health measures implemented in the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as our temporary personnel initiatives due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could be subject to an increase in litigation, in particular in relation to our vendors and our employees, including with respect to health and safety measures. In the course of our business, we are also subject to other proceedings, such as regulatory and tax investigations and audits as well as inspections by tax and other regulatory authorities, which may expose us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including penalties and suspension or disqualification from procurement contracting. For example, we are currently subject to an inquiry by the Portuguese Competition Authority in relation to alleged employee non-poaching arrangements. This inquiry is in its early stages, with no material findings to date. In addition, we are typically required to comply with certain quality standards in connection with the provision of certain services to our customers and, pursuant to some of our contracts, our customers are entitled to certain audit rights in regards to our compliance with such standards. Our quality control framework is based on the certification of our operations and processes, regular process audits by our internal compliance team and independent external quality assurance providers. Any finding of our non-compliance resulting from these audits could result in breach of contract claims and negative publicity which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Business—Quality Assurance.” In addition, even if a litigation claim (of any nature) is covered by our indemnification insurance, is without merit, does not prevail or is not pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against our business or services and solutions could adversely affect our reputation. Regardless of its final outcome, litigation may also result in substantial costs and expenses we would have to incur to defend ourselves, divert the attention of our management or cause an interruption of our normal business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Should competition authorities depart from the current definition of a single market for IT services enterprise, and define markets narrowly, we may become subject to an investigation into the strength of our market position. In such cases, a potential investigation could give rise to certain obligations or restrictions on our market behavior if we are deemed to have a dominant position. Such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we may become subject to investigations and proceedings by national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of antitrust laws, which could result in fines or other forms of liability or otherwise damage our reputation. Such laws and regulations could limit or prevent our ability to grow in certain markets. Future acquisition or business combination opportunities and mergers may require approvals from antitrust authorities under antitrust regulations in force at the time. Even if such approvals are obtained, they might require, based on the relevant antitrust authority’s evaluation of prevailing market conditions and our position in the market, that we divest certain businesses in order to carry out the transaction. We may otherwise be unable to obtain the required approvals, which would likely result in the relevant transaction being aborted or revised in a way that may be detrimental to us. Furthermore, as a consequence of our investments in businesses operating in the IT sector, as well as our position in certain of our markets, antitrust regulatory authorities may impose limitations on our ability to operate in such markets by adjusting our market behavior or otherwise. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We have made and may make _acquisitions or enter into transactions that may present risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction and, additionally, there are risks associated with the integration of any acquisitions.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Changes in tax laws or regulations or in their interpretation could adversely affect our tax position, such as our effective tax rate or tax payments. ----- In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, and ratified by France on September 26, 2018, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017, by the ATAD II, which, _inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its_ provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from January 1, 2020. The ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30.0% of the taxpayer’s tax adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million per year, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules apply since January 1, 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance Law for 2019”). The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also implemented under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD II and thus introduced new anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 205 B and seq. of the French Tax Code. In addition, the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, with effect as from January 1, 2019, the anti-abuse provision provided by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, which is set forth by Article 205 A of the French Tax Code, the French tax authorities may ignore, for the determination of corporate income tax, an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuine, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The condition relating to the absence of genuineness of the arrangement or series of arrangements would be met if such arrangement or series of arrangements were established for invalid commercial reasons. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the European Union, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between European Union countries and nonEuropean Union countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. On May 18, 2021 the European Commission communicated a new plan called Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (“Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) which aims to replace the CCCTB in the European tax policy proposals. BEFIT is based mainly on the framework of the OECD’s international tax reform project, and would involve the consolidation of the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to Member States using a formula, to be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and will give rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. The Commission’s aim is to introduce BEFIT into EU legislation by 2023. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes, (ii) adopt a recommendation on the domestic treatment of losses and (iii) make a legislative proposal creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Following these initiatives, on December 22, 2021, the European Commission released two Directive proposals: (i) one Directive proposal to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for improper tax purposes within the European Union (if adopted, this Directive should be transposed by June 30, 2023 for an entry into force as of January 1, 2024), and (ii) one Directive proposal ensuring a minimum 15.0% effective tax rate for large multinational groups carrying on their activities in the European Union (if adopted, this Directive should be transposed by December 31, 2022 for entry into force as of January 1, 2023 for most of the provisions), and, on May 11, 2022, the European Commission released a Directive proposal introducing an allowance for the ----- deduction for tax purposes of notional interest on equity and a limitation on the tax deductibility of borrowing costs (if adopted, this Directive should be transposed by December 31, 2023 for entry into force as of January 1, 2024). We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our rental offerings and services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The Council of the European Union adopted on December 5, 2017 its conclusions on the EU list of noncooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the “Council Conclusions”) which is composed of two sub-lists (respectively, the “Black List” and the “Grey List” together referred to as the “EU List”). The EU List was established to improve tax good governance globally, and to ensure that the EU’s international partners respect the same standards as EU Member States do. The Black List, which shall be updated at least once a year is currently composed of nine jurisdictions (American Samoa, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States Virgin Islands, and Vanuatu). Furthermore, the Council published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order to comply with the European Union screening criteria. Though there is no applicable sanction yet, EU Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions. A French law that aims at fighting tax fraud was published on October 24, 2018 (Law 2018-898 of October 23, 2018) and expands under certain conditions the French tax regime regarding the Non-Cooperative States as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code to certain States and jurisdictions included into the Black List. As a result, interest paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in certain States and jurisdictions included into the Black List or paid on an account opened in a financial institution located in such States and jurisdictions may be subject to withholding tax in France and not be deductible for purposes of the computation of the debtor’s corporate income tax liability. These provisions apply to such States and jurisdictions as from the first day of the third month following the publication of the order (arrêté) including such States and jurisdictions on the list of Non-Cooperative States.

However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on the EU FTT. The EU FTT could, if introduced in its current draft form, apply, under certain circumstances, to some transactions involving the Notes and to persons both established within and outside the Participating Member States. On October 10, 2016, the European Commission has been tasked with the drafting of the legislation that will be submitted to the Participating Member States. However, and despite several attempts, no agreement has been found between the Participating Member States so far. Such Participating Member States agreed to continue negotiating on a new proposal based on the French model, which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval, the scope of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. In February 2021, the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union proposed an inclusive discussion among all Member States on tax design issues of the EU FTT.

Although the Indenture will limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. Goodwill impairment and other non-cash charges in our profit or loss account, as well as charges recognized directly in equity, if incurred, could potentially reduce the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ reserves available for distribution and thus reduce or prevent upstream dividend payments directly or indirectly to the Issuer.

If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or security provider of security interests may have no liability or decreased liability under its Note Guarantee or security interest, as applicable, depending on the amount of its other obligations and applicable law. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under insolvency or bankruptcy law and other laws, a court could (i) subordinate or void any Note Guarantee or any security interest, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or security interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the Note Guarantee or security interest was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or the security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was merely aware that the Guarantor or the security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the granting of the Note Guarantee and/or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent as a result of having granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was under-capitalized or became under-capitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the granting of the relevant Note Guarantee and/or security interest was held not to be in the best interests or not to be for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider or was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security provider; or - the aggregate amounts paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or enforcement proceeds under the relevant security were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if: the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount required to pay its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they became due; or it could not pay its debts as they became due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, or security provider under the relevant Security Document, will be limited to the amount that will result in such Note Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent preference or conveyance or improper corporate distribution or unlawful financial assistance or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurances as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Note Guarantee, or the granting of the security, was a fraudulent preference or conveyance or unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such Note Guarantee or Security Document are ineffective, could void the security interests in the Collateral, or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such Note Guarantee or any enforcement proceeds received from enforcement of the Collateral. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent preference or conveyance occurred, ----- you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer, any other Guarantor or security provider, if applicable, under any Note Guarantees or Security Documents that have not been declared void. Additionally, any future pledge or charge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent (or, in favor of the holders of the Notes, as represented by the Security Agent, as applicable), including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the security provider (as debtorin-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer in any other insolvency proceeding) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge or charge, the pledge or charge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or charge had not been given and a insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within a certain time period following the pledge or charge. Further, pursuant to Article 2302 of the French Civil Code, if a beneficiary of the Note Guarantees is a credit institution (établissement de crédit) or a financial institution (société de financement), then it is obliged to indicate in writing to the relevant French Guarantor(s), prior to March 31 of each year, (i) the total of the sums guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors pursuant to the Indenture as at December 31 of the preceding year, and (ii) the date of expiry of the obligations of such Guarantors.

As a consequence, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will provide instructions to the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Article 2488-6 et seq. of the French Code Civil as modified by Ordinance n 2017-748 of May 4, 2017 and by law n°2019-486 of May 22, 2019.

As regards the security interests to be pledged as Collateral governed by the laws of France, the Security Agent will hold such security interests to be pledged as Collateral as security agent for the beneficiaries under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. As regards the security interests to be pledged as Collateral governed by laws other than the laws of France, in order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). To the extent that the appointment of the Security Agent as authorized representative of the holders of the Notes would not be respected by a competent court or a trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer in any other insolvency proceeding) and the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the holders of the Notes as represented by the Security Agent as a result are successfully challenged by other parties or deemed invalid, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of ----- the security interests in the Collateral.

In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, a security interest may not in all circumstances have priority over a security interest granted over the same Collateral on a later date.

Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial attribution (attribution _judiciaire) or by an expert pre contractually agreed or appointed by a judge in the context of a private_ attribution (pacte commissoire). In a proceeding regarding an attribution judiciaire or a pacte commissoire, an expert is appointed to value the collateral (in this case, the securities) and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law.

Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We believe we are one of Europe’s leading IT services companies, providing a holistic suite of digital services and solutions to over 10,000 customers in 29 countries across Europe, Latin America, North America, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We are well-positioned in our key geographic markets (France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal) as an end-to-end services and solutions provider, with comprehensive offerings that are strategically diversified by activity, industry vertical and technology. We operate across eight key industry verticals: Public Sector and Healthcare, Financial Services, Transport Travel Services (TTS), Energy, Utilities and Chemicals (EUC), Retail and Consumer Goods (RCG), Telecom Media Technology (TMT), Industry and Services and Defense and Security. We also provide a wide range of end-to-end services and solutions, from custom software integration, solutions development, application management and consulting, to outsourcing and value-added reselling, combining innovation-based differentiation and automation-based efficiency. We categorize our portfolio of services and solutions into seven activities: Application Services, Business Solutions, Infrastructure Services, Value-Added Reselling, Outsourcing, Consulting and Software Solutions. We believe that our wide range of digital services and solutions, coupled with the quality of our work, the proximity-based nature of our delivery model and our local and linguistic expertise, are a key differentiating factor of our business, increasing customer satisfaction and retention, while contributing to our diversified revenue base. The breadth of these offerings gives us exposure to well-diversified end-market industry verticals, with no industry vertical representing more than 30% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. Within the global IT services market, we operate in attractive and growing geographic markets, mainly France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, where growth is mainly driven by structural digital trends, including digital penetration of new business areas, increased outsourcing and external IT expenditure, the boost in ----- digitalization led by COVID-19 and the increased complexity of systems and software required to maintain legacy IT infrastructure. We are a long-term partner of large, blue-chip IT customers and a one-stop shop for fast-growing mid-market customers, which we serve through our regional footprint and local delivery networks. Large companies accounted for more than 90% of our revenue from our top 100 customers for the year ended December 31, 2021. We maintain long-term relationships with many of these customers. More than half of our top ten customers have been with us for more than ten years and revenue generated from our top ten customers grew at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 4% over the same period. We estimate that recurring and highly repeatable revenue accounted for approximately 71% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, translating into a strong demand backlog and revenue visibility. We believe that our business has a differentiated growth platform which is demonstrated by our historic performance, driven by our diverse value proposition and efficient execution capabilities. We are also an established consolidation platform, in particular through the acquisition and integration of more than 25 companies since 2016. In successfully scaling-up our business, we have benefitted from the experience of our CEO, Vincent Rouaix, and CFO, Cyril Malher, and we currently benefit from the support and expertise of Bain Capital, who has been our majority shareholder since July 2022. Among other advantages, this has allowed us to maintain our strong track record of attracting and retaining best-in-class talent, which are at the heart of innovation in our business. Over five decades, we have grown organically and through acquisitions to become one of the leading providers of IT services in Europe. As such, we intend to strategically position ourselves in key markets such as the French and Spanish markets and aim to capture the expected structural digital transformation and rise in demand for IT services. We also aim to continue leveraging our market expansion track record to push significant growth initiatives throughout our business, including pursuing new growth opportunities, markets and business models. Furthermore, we intend to maintain and consolidate our leadership position in our core IT activities and in our various industry verticals, while continuing the service portfolio transformation towards our Consulting and Business Solutions activities. As the IT services market remains highly fragmented, we seek to further strengthen our position and broaden our product portfolio, capabilities and geographic presence by continuing to consolidate smaller players. As one of the largest multi-local players in the fragmented IT services market, we have the resources and expertise, including a deep knowledge of legacy IT infrastructures, to act as a true partner to our customers in their digital transformation. Multi-local providers like us generally benefit from regional footprints and high customer proximity in several countries. We see focused investments in talent and vendor partnerships as an opportunity to accelerate the shift of our revenue mix towards digital services and solutions, with expected corresponding uplift in organic revenue growth and margin. In addition, we seek to continue leveraging our diversified operating platform and realizing economies of scale to grow our profitability and improve our margins. We believe that we have the potential to close the gap between our profit margin levels and our peers’ through several identified, tangible levers, including streamlining our organization, optimizing our subcontracting process, increasing the flexibility of our cost structure. Our competitive advantages, operating model and the attractive underlying fundamentals of the IT services market in which we operate, have enabled us to deliver a strong financial performance, with our revenue increasing at a CAGR of 17.9% over the two years ended December 31, 2021 and organic revenue growth of 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.2.1,,"Macroeconomic and Market Trends The majority of our business is conducted in Europe, with France, Iberia and BeLux collectively accounting for 90.3% of our revenue in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, with some additional revenue generated in Poland, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Bulgaria. Our revenue has generally remained resilient through volatile macroeconomic cycles during the past ten years, as demonstrated by our organic revenue growth. Nonetheless, macroeconomic conditions, market trends and customer demands, particularly in France and the other countries where we operate, have a significant impact on our results of operations. Further, the mid- to long-term impact of the economic recessionary pressures and inflation (including rising labor and materials costs) currently in play in the global and local markets where we operate, as well as the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, are difficult to predict and could have a significant impact on our future performance and results of operations. In 2020, we were unevenly impacted in terms of EBITDA performance across our geographic areas by the COVID-19 pandemic, with our key geographic area, France, being the most impacted as a result of some of the longest and strictest containment measures in Europe, with ----- activity levels only catching up to historical levels in November 2020. The resulting loss of revenue opportunity in France during 2020 was offset to an extent by governmental subsidies and some non-recurring savings on operational expenses. In contrast, Belgium and Spain continued to grow organically (bolstered by the acquisition of IECISA, in the case of Spain) during 2020 in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to the service mix in these countries being more reliant on our VAR activity, which was less affected by the pandemic than some of our services requiring personal interactions. In 2021, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business was relatively limited, as each of our geographic areas began to experience an overall, sustainable recovery from the initial effects of the pandemic, with some negative impact on our gross margin (which we define as revenue less billable costs, which consist of (v) billable FTE staff costs and subcontracting costs, (w) cost of billable services (such as cost of materials, licenses and maintenance purchases), (x) indirect billable costs allocated to billable FTEs and reinvoiced to customers (rental, purchases and external fees) and (y) capitalized internal R&D expenses reduced by the related depreciation) in our LatAm business, which was offset by overall strong performance by our Business Solutions and Software Solutions activities in France, cross-selling and up-selling opportunities with IECISA in Iberia and strong performance in BeLux. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in some countries we experienced an increase in customer demand for digitalization services and solutions across almost all of our industry verticals, as both private businesses and public sector customers relied more heavily on their IT infrastructures and systems and turned to remote working and cloud-based solutions. At the same time, there were a number of government initiatives introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic that positively contributed to the Group’s ability to manage cash flows. These measures, however, ended in the course of 2021. Management believes that, thanks to its strong geographic area, activity and industry vertical diversification, the Group demonstrated an ability to rebound, in part based on its local footprint, favoring flexible decision-making based on local needs and legislation, including revisions to incentive-based structures to adapt to the changing environment. The outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022 has caused an immediate impact on global economic conditions, and the uncertain resolution of this conflict could result in protracted and severe damage to the global economy. Although we do not have a physical presence in, and our activity in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine is negligible, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential impacts the war could have on our operations. The war has also caused supply shortage of, and therefore increased prices of, gas, energy and other raw materials, further disrupted the global supply chain, which had already been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent delays and limitations, and added to inflation, all of which are significantly impacting many companies, industries and sectors directly and indirectly, resulting in us incurring increased operating costs and some of our customers reconsidering their IT expenditure, which may, in turn, impact our results of operations. At the same time, labor cost inflation as a result of overall inflation is expected to lead to higher costs of labor, which in turn could lead to an increase in the Group’s operating costs. Notwithstanding the above, we are generally able to pass through increased costs due to labor shortages and inflation to our customers. Management of Inflationary Pressures We have historically maintained margin discipline suggesting experience and multiple strategies to deal with inflation by: (i) passing costs through to customers, especially in high growth areas, (ii) optimizing costs via the reallocation of staff across customers and projects and the use of nearshoring and freelancers and (iii) improving productivity. As the majority of our cost base is comprised of billable costs, inflation can be passed through to customers via different mechanisms. For short-term contracts such as time-based contracts, we can renegotiate with customers on prices and profiles, with pricing power in our favor due to the limited supply available and high demand for IT services and solutions. For multi-year contracts such as System Integration and Application Management contracts, there are typically contractual price revision clauses linked to the Syntec index (which measures changes in the cost of services in the IT services market in France, or its equivalent in non-French countries) thereby allowing us to pass through part of such price increases. Additionally, for multi-year contracts such as Outsourcing, where energy inflation is a concern, our contracts have a specific index linked to the price of energy. Similarly, when quoting for short-term projects of less than six months, the effect of inflation is embedded into our pricing. As part of our approach to cost management, we are engaged in active streamlining of our organization, including simplifying our processes, nearshoring our back-office and increasing capacity utilization. We also intend to optimize our subcontracting process by improving our relationships and increasing synergies with ----- our subcontractors and internalizing longer-tenure subcontractors (see “Summary—Our Strategy”). This active management of costs and reduction of delivery costs is expected to assist us in dealing with an economic environment of rising costs. The remainder of our cost base, which is not directly billable, is comprised of operating expenses, such as sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, which are less prone to inflationary pressures. Personnel expenses comprise the vast majority of these operating expenses, and we expect limited wage increases, as these employees are not subject to the same high demand that we see for our billable FTEs. Residual operating costs pertain to leases which are also more inflation-resistant, as they are generally structured with regulated multi-year contracts that include inflation caps. Digitalization and Regulatory Trends During the periods under review, increasing digitalization favored demand across all our activities and industry verticals, and was particularly driven by structural digital transformation trends, including (i) the rising penetration of digital technologies in new business areas and the continued proliferation of new applications and data, prompting companies to adopt larger IT budgets and require continued support; (ii) increased IT outsourcing and external IT expenditure due to the need for flexible IT resources, higher service quality, cost savings and better overall end-user engagement; (iii) the boost in digitalization sparked by COVID-19, including acceleration of e-commerce and the adoption of work-from-home tools, which we expect to be permanent; and (iv) the increased complexity of systems and software required to maintain legacy IT infrastructure. Other relevant factors include increasing and more complex regulation of customers across several of the industry verticals we serve and the development of new technologies (such as data management, AI and cybersecurity tools and services). Mix across Activities, Industry Verticals and Geographic Areas Our results of operations are affected by the mix of revenue and margins of the services and solutions that we offer to our customers across our different activities, industry verticals and geographic areas. _Mix across activities_ We provide a wide range of end-to-end services and solutions, from custom software integration, solutions development, application management and consulting, to outsourcing and value-added reselling, combining innovation-based differentiation and automation-based efficiency. We categorize our services into six activities: Application Services, Business Solutions, Infrastructure Services, VAR, Outsourcing and Consulting, and our services are complemented by our cross-functional Software Solutions activity. As part of a strategic initiative launched in France in 2016, we have been optimizing our portfolio mix towards our Business Solutions and Consulting activities, which we view, along with digitalization, as activities with higher added value, better margins and greater revenue growth potential, relative to other activities overall.

This is evidenced by our high customer satisfaction rates (approximately 90% in France in the year ended December 31, 2021 according to customer satisfaction surveys that we perform at the end of projects on a continuous basis), which we believe contributes to our increasing contract renewal rates (calculated on the basis of the total value of existing contracts rolled forward in any given year), which in France have been at or above 90% since 2019 and was 95% in the year ended December 31, 2021, and the longevity of our customer relationships (almost all of our top ten customers from 2012 were still within our top 16 customers in 2021). ----- We consider revenue to be recurring if we expect to generate such revenue in one or more of the following years, either based on our track record with the customer, such as revenue generated by existing customers seeking new services or solutions and from long-term agreements with customers for whom we have implemented proprietary or customized solutions or pursuant to specific contractual arrangements, as is the case with our system integration, application management, outsourcing and software contracts. See “Business—Customers—Customer Contracts.” As a further example of the loyalty of our customer base, each of our top ten customers have been with us for more than ten years and revenue generated from these customers grew at a CAGR of 4% in the same period. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our top ten customers generated 18.5% of our revenue. We believe that the loyalty of our customers is due to their satisfaction with the quality of our services and solutions, our deep knowledge of complex IT systems and our customers’ businesses and the high costs required to switch IT service providers. Our loyal customer base has also become increasingly diverse, considerably reducing our customer concentration, with our top 35 customers representing 55.6% of our revenue in 2016 and 35.3% of our revenue in 2021. In particular, many of our services and solutions are highly customized and deeply integrated into our customers’ IT systems, as a result of which our replacement would be a complicated, time-consuming and expensive process. We also typically benefit from strong demand backlog at the beginning of the year, which further contributes to revenue visibility. As of January 2022, we estimated that approximately 71% of our 2022 yearly budget was covered through amounts expected to be realized in connection with projects in our weighted pipeline, T&M contracts for the next three months and oral commitments. This amount increased from approximately 67% in 2021, which we believe reflects strong demand backlog and gives us a good level of revenue visibility, barring significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop which could impact our weighted pipeline in particular. _DSO and Trade Receivables Without Contracts Assets and Advances and Deposits Paid For Orders_ We generally issue invoices for the services we offer to our customers at the time of delivery on a monthly basis, such as for time and material contracts. For fixed price contracts, customers often make a down payment at the time of the execution of the contract and make subsequent payments according to a payment schedule and milestone delivery. While we believe our typical payment terms are consistent with those of our peers, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we carry significant accounts receivable on our balance sheet from customers that generate a large portion of our revenue. The lengths of payment cycles for services rendered vary across our different industry verticals as well as the type of customer we serve. Our DSO for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 41 days, as compared to 43 days for the year ended December 31, 2020, 51 days for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 58 days as of June 30, 2022, in each case in terms of invoiced revenue. Further, our average DSOs generally declined across our historical perimeter in France, Portugal and Belgium during 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. DSOs vary across our geographic areas and tend to be the lowest in BeLux, the highest in Africa and otherwise relatively similar to each other across the other countries in which we operate. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we experienced a significant delay in invoicing, due to the rollout of our new ERP system (SAP), which led to an additional approximate €50 million of working capital outflow in France as of June 30, 2022. Trade receivables without contracts assets and advances and deposits paid for orders vary across our geographic areas and amounted to €370.9 in the year ended December 31, 2021 (of which 43.0% were incurred in France, 37.0% were incurred in Iberia, 6.8% were incurred in BeLux, 4.5% were incurred in LatAm and 8.7% were incurred in our Other countries), as compared with €335.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (of which 39.6% were incurred in France, 41.6% were incurred in Iberia, 4.2% were incurred in BeLux, 5.0% were incurred in LatAm and 9.5% were incurred in our Other countries). In addition, we engage regularly in the sale of receivables on the basis of non-recourse factoring to manage our working capital during peak periods, as is customary in our industry. With the sale of the trade receivables for non-recourse factoring, the factoring company assumes substantially all risks in connection with the transferred receivables. Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to rely primarily on our operating cash flow, as well as our Revolving Credit Facility and the factoring of receivables to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. _Seasonality_ We have limited seasonality with respect to our revenue throughout the year. However, our operating margin is typically higher in the second half of the year. This seasonality effect is mostly driven by (i) an improvement in our activity ratio (which is calculated as the ratio of days worked during the relevant period to the number of Potential Days. Potential Days corresponds to the number of Working Days, multiplied by the number of ----- Billable FTEs, excluding vacation days and certain other days of inactivity) due to progressively increasing demand, which is in turn driven by the typical timing for customer decisions that impact IT expenditure, (ii) the release of project and bonus provisions at the end of the year, which reflects the larger number of projects that are concluded in the second half of the year and (iii) the contribution of license revenue in the second half of the year, which reflects the fact that we conclude more projects that generate license revenue in the second half of the year, for the reasons described above. Our working capital levels typically peak in the summer months and in September and October, with lower points in June and December of each year, in connection with payments of invoices by our customers and following typical invoicing patterns. _Acquisitions_ Value-accretive acquisitions of attractive IT services and solutions assets have been a significant driver of growth in our operations, breadth of services and solutions offerings, geographic scale, revenue and EBITDA. Since January 1, 2019, we have completed 14 acquisitions, including our acquisition of IECISA in 2020, which allowed us to significantly expand our operations in Iberia. We completed six acquisitions in 2019, one acquisition in 2020, three acquisitions in 2021 and four acquisitions in the six months ended June 30, 2022 (collectively, the “Acquired Companies”), in each case excluding transactions in which we only increased our stake in previously consolidated companies. Due to the changes in our scope of consolidation as a consequence of each of such acquisitions, our results of operations in the periods under review are not entirely comparable. The table below shows the acquisitions we have completed since 2019, noting the principal country of operation for each Acquired Company. **2019** **2020** **2021** **2022** Capital Consulting Bridgeo IECISA Ilex International JCommerce Hutobee (Morocco) (Cameroun) (Iberia) (France) (Poland) (France) Archos Technology Hundred Projixi Europe EditInfo-IT Do IT Wise (Morocco) (Peru) (France) (Morocco) (Bulgaria) SIS I2S HLi Consulting (France) (Iberia/Africa) (Morocco/Tunisia) Historically, we have funded our acquisitions primarily with cash from operations and debt. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and the six months ended June 30, 2022, we spent €31.8 million, €269.2 million, €17.2 million and €49.5 million, respectively, on acquisition consideration. We believe that the acquisitions we made in the periods under review have generated synergies for our business and have also contributed to our organic growth by generating cross-selling and up-selling opportunities. After each acquisition, we review both our portfolio of offers and potential customers to identify potential for synergies. Among our portfolio of offers, Business Solutions and Software Solutions are usually the areas where we can most readily find synergies. When an acquisition exposes us to a new country, we assess the opportunities that may be possible with subsidiaries of our top customers. Once an acquired business is fully integrated in our business, we aim to increase its volumes of operations by leveraging our global and local platforms. In the future, we intend to continue to grow our business through disciplined strategic bolt-on acquisitions of specialized IT services providers in order to add complementary technology to our portfolio, as well as to enlarge our customer base and expand internationally. See “Business—Our Strategies—Continue _making targeted and opportunistic acquisitions to expand our portfolio, capabilities and geographic presence.”_ See also “—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition— _Acquisitions” below for an explanation of how acquisitions during the periods under review have affected the_ comparability of our results across these periods. _Investments in R&D, Innovation and Capital Expenditure_ To maintain our competitive position, we test our innovative services and solutions on a continuous basis in order to enhance our offering in ways that we believe are or will be of interest to the market and existing and potential customers. We invested approximately €50.0 million, €58.0 million and €59.0 million in R&D in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively: €24.7 million, €27.2 million and €27.7 million, respectively of this R&D expense was capitalized. The remaining portion was recognized as an expense under staff costs, less any research tax credits (notably, in our case, the French government’s R&D tax credit). We are currently involved in research projects in the following key areas, which span our industry verticals: digital industry, smart transportation, digital and physical security, smart city and smart government solutions, ----- energy, waste management, 5G, digital media, cloud, Big Data, blockchain and AI. In 2021, we focused our efforts on the following themes: AI to serve our customers’ businesses, AI for operations (AI Ops), AI for development (AI Dev), virtual and augmented reality, the value and intelligence of massive data, IoT, cybersecurity, blockchain and new tools for modelling and developing new applications and services. Our ability to continue to compete and to maintain and grow our business is dependent on the success of our investments in R&D and innovation, which depends in turn on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and leadership. Our capital expenditure for the periods under review primarily related to investments in intangible assets and capitalized R&D, in connection with our Software Solutions activity. We incurred €36.2 million, €38.0 million and €45.2 million of capital expenditure in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, representing 2.3%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue in the same periods, respectively. For further information, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure.” _Cost Structure, Cost Saving Initiatives and Synergies_ Our cost structure primarily comprises personnel expenses. Nearly 90% of our workforce consists of billable consultants. In particular, staff costs represented on average 62% of our total costs included in our operating margin in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. To further support our resilient business model and increase our margins and/or lower our costs, during the periods under review we have taken actions to: - manage our activity ratio and/or lower our selling, general and administrative costs, resulting in the incurrence of €11.5 million, €15.9 million and €16.0 million per year of restructuring costs (excluding acquisitions) in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, mainly in France, Iberia and Belgium; - implement cost saving initiatives and synergies following acquisitions, most notably following the IECISA acquisition in 2020; and - purchase, through establishing a Group purchasing department and achieving procurement synergies in IT capital expenditure, car fleet and VAR sourcing, and relocation, through rightsizing our real estate footprint primarily by reducing our office rental stock, notably in Paris where we have closed or are in the process of closing six of our ten offices following increased remote working after the COVID-19 pandemic. Going forward, we intend to implement a cost savings plan with the objective of reaching €20 million per year of cost savings within the next 18 months, which is focused on streamlining our organization, optimizing our subcontracting process, increasing the flexibility of our cost structure by improving our processes in connection with selling, general and administrative expenses.

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.6,Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.6.1,,"_The Transactions_ The Financial Statements have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statements, statements of financial position or cash flow statements that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, the Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities and we may add additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, brand name, customer relationships, leasehold rights and software. We may also recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Financial Statements that are included in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, we will incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions. As of June 30, 2022, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had total net debt in an aggregate amount of €1,121.2 million, consisting of the Notes, the Senior Facilities and lease liabilities. See “Capitalization”and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” In addition, on or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, we will have €200.0 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility, which is ----- expected to be undrawn on the Issue Date. Our indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry and the emergence of new business opportunities, since a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to meeting debt services requirements, and this may place us at a competitive disadvantage, as some of our competitors have lower leverage levels than we do and thus may be able to react to such changes and opportunities more quickly. _Acquisitions_ The historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is affected by the acquisitions that we have made, which have changed our scope of consolidation and this may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate the historical performance of our business. Accordingly, our historical results are not, and results for future periods will not be, directly comparable to past periods because of the acquisition activity that we have undertaken. Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the date of acquisition, which corresponds to the date on which the Group took control of them and until control ceases. In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed from the acquired entity are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and may be adjusted during the 12 months following such date. _Reclassification of LatAm Results of Operations_ During the periods under review and up to December 31, 2021, our results of operations from our branches in LatAm (which were mainly serving the Public Sector and Healthcare industry vertical), were recorded in our statutory accounts within the Iberia segment and were subsequently reclassified into the LatAm segment without reconciliation to prior periods. Additionally, our results of operations from our activities in LatAm are affected by large but infrequent projects, which may lead to variations in our results year-on-year, whereas our results in Iberia tend to be consistent and reflect the nature of demand in more mature markets, such as Spain and Portugal. Accordingly, our historical results are not, and results for future periods following December 31, 2021 will not be, directly comparable to past periods.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

This increase was principally driven by growth across all of our geographic areas. In particular, growth increased organically in France by 6.7%, in Iberia by 10.8% (supported by strong performances across our services offering and VAR), in LatAm by 10.1% and in BeLux by 1.8%.

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.19,Geographic Area Mix of Revenue,17.19.1,,"_France_ France accounted for €452.8 million and €488.0 million, or 41%, of our total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Revenue in France increased over the period as a result of recovery of the business across our activities from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher activity levels as compared to 2021 due to strong customer demand, especially in Application Services across the industry verticals we serve and Business Solutions. Our Software Solutions activity also supported revenue in France, as did our acquisition of Ilex International. _Iberia_ Iberia accounted for €412.1 million and €402.5 million, or 37% and 34%, of our total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of IECISA, revenue in Iberia was €388 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to €402 million in the same period in 2022, reflecting the impact of the reclassification of our LatAm branches and significant growth in services. _BeLux_ BeLux accounted for €161.0 million and €159.4 million, or 15% and 14%, of our total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Revenue in BeLux decreased over the period as a result of constraints on resource availability, partially offset by a slight increase in our VAR activity during the period under review. ----- _LatAm_ LatAm accounted for €37.1 million and €71.2 million, or 3% and 6%, of our total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of IECISA, revenue in LatAm grew from €61.2 million to €71.2 million, an increase of 16% over the same period. Revenue in LatAm increased significantly over the period as a result of contracts signed in Mexico in the six months ended June 30, 2022 (as compared to in the six months ended June 30, 2021, which was a slower period) coupled with expansion in Peru where we had new opportunities with both existing and new customers. _Other_ Our Other countries accounted for €45.4 million and €56.7 million, or 4.1% and 4.8%, of our total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Revenue in our Other countries increased over the period as a result of our ability to leverage skilled personnel who command competitive market prices, particularly in Eastern European countries, such as Poland. We also experienced the beginning of a recovery in activity in our African operations. Staff costs Staff costs increased by €54.2 million, or 8.7%, from €619.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €674.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was principally driven by the increase in headcount due to the acquisitions completed during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Operating expenses Operating expenses increased slightly by €2.7 million, or 0.7%, from €378.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €380.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was principally driven by an increase in travel expenses and the cost of insurance. Non-income taxes Non-income taxes increased slightly by €0.9 million, or 9.5%, from €9.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €10.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Amortization (other than goodwill) Amortization (other than goodwill) increased slightly by €1.9 million, or 5.9%, from €32.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €34.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Other underlying operating income and expenses Other underlying operating income and expenses decreased slightly by €0.3 million, from €2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Operating margin Operating margin increased by €9.3 million, or 13.3%, from €70.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €79.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was principally driven by revenue growth (as discussed above), gross margin improvement and acquisitions. _France_ France accounted for €849.0 million and €906.7 million, or 43% and 41%, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Revenue in France increased over the period as a result of recovery of the business across our activities from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, higher ----- activity levels as compared to 2020 (although still below 2019 levels) in spite of reduced headcount, and the integration of Projixy. Our Business Solutions, Software Solutions and Consulting activities performed particularly well in 2021, bolstered by several contracts and improvements in average selling prices. In Application Services, our largest activity in France, revenue increased by 9.0%, or €30.4 million, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, driven by improved activity ratio, combined with improvement in our average selling prices, with such improvements being well spread out across our activities, particularly in Financial Services and Public Sector and Healthcare. In our Business Solutions activity, revenue grew by 11.4%, or €11.8 million, supported by strong performance across all our offerings and improved activity ratio and higher average selling prices. In our Infrastructure Applications activity, growth was limited, with revenue growing 4.1%, or €10.0 million, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, with resilience in this activity being driven by the long-term nature of contracts, supported by improvements in our activity ratio and increases in our average selling prices, particularly in regards to customers in our Financial Services activity who are exposed to the insurance sector. In our Outsourcing activity, revenue decreased by 14.4%, or €4.0 million, driven by the end of contracts with Thales and Kidiliz. In our Software Solutions activity, revenue grew by 10.1%, or €12.8 million, driven by activity in relation to licenses and maintenance, as well as an improved activity ratio. _Iberia_ Iberia accounted for €678.1 million and €814.3 million, or 34% and 37%, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Revenue in Iberia increased over the period as a result of continued cross-selling with, and the full integration of, IECISA. _BeLux_ BeLux accounted for €294.8 million and €321.8 million, or 15%, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Revenue in BeLux increased over the period as a result of continuous growth across all activities, with increasing strength in digitalization and cloud offerings. Additionally, revenue grew in Belgium in our Application Services and Infrastructure Services activities, which was driven by an improvement in our activity ratio and a higher average selling price. From December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, revenue in BeLux increased organically by 9.4%, or €26.6 million, driven by performance in Belgium, particularly in our Application Services and Infrastructure activities, supported by business with Corylut, which is a key customer in both activities. Our Software Solutions activity in Belgium also benefited from improved activity ratio and higher average selling prices. _LatAm_ LatAm accounted for €58.8 million and €83.4 million, or 3% and 4%, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Revenue in LatAm increased over the period as a result of strong performance in Mexico, Colombia and Peru, which offset the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in other countries in LatAm. _Other_ Our Other countries accounted for €85.2 million and €92.8 million, or 4% in each case, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue in our Other countries increased organically by 8.9% or €7.6 million, supported by performance in Eastern Europe, particularly in Romania and Poland, driven by our relationships with Rolls Royce, Nokia, Renault and Société Générale and where our number of FTEs grew and our activity ratio and average selling prices increased. This was partially offset by a slight decline in Africa over the same period, with Morocco underperforming as compared to historic levels and with our Application Services, Infrastructure Services and Software Solutions activities lacking new business and experiencing changes to planned projects. ----- Staff costs Staff costs increased by €123.5 million, or 11.3%, from €1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was principally driven by the increase in headcount due to the acquisitions completed in the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating expenses Operating expenses increased by €89.3 million, or 13.4%, from €664.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €753.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was principally driven by the impact of acquisitions, significant subcontractors hires in some geographic areas, leading to additional recruitment and insurance fees. Non-income taxes Non-income taxes increased slightly by €0.6 million, or 3.2%, from €17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Amortization (other than goodwill) Amortization (other than goodwill) stayed largely consistent throughout the periods under review, increasing by €1.0 million, or 1.4%, from €66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other underlying operating income and expenses Other underlying operating income and expenses increased by €2.1 million, from €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating margin Operating margin increased by €40.9 million, or 33.1%, from €123.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €164.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was principally driven by revenue growth (as discussed above), gross margin improvement and acquisitions. _France_ France accounted for €925.5 million and €849.0 million, or 58% and 43% (decrease in proportion mainly due to the IECISA acquisition), of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Revenue in France decreased over the period as a result of a decrease in our Application Services activity (our largest activity in France), relating to certain of our blue-chip customers facing new protocols and implementing new cost savings measures (particularly among our Financial Services customers) and a decrease in our Outsourcing activity, due in large part to the termination of our Kidiliz contract, which is currently the subject of a dispute. These revenue decreases were partially offset by a resilient average selling price and strong revenue generation in our Infrastructure Services and Software Solutions activities, which were more resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic and where we were able to offer wider ranges of recurring services to some of our small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers, notably relating to digitalization and the transition to remote working in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In France, in our Application Services, Infrastructure Services and Outsourcing activities, we experienced an overall decrease in revenue due to the impact of COVID-19, with Application Services being particularly impacted by the effects of the pandemic on our Financial Services and our TTS customers, including airlines and rental car businesses. Revenue in our Outsourcing activity also decreased, as the result of certain customer contracts coming to an end, coupled with the impact of COVID-19 on our customers’ business needs. Revenue in our Infrastructure Services activity were more resilient, due to the long-term nature of many of our projects in this activity. _Iberia_ Iberia accounted for €253.5 million and €678.1 million, or 16% and 34%, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Revenue in Iberia increased over the period as a result of our acquisition of IECISA, where we benefited from cross-selling and up-selling with IECISA, the recruitment of over 500 new billable FTEs, a context of broadly stable average selling price and cost-base streamlining as we realized synergies from the acquisition of IECISA. Revenue in Iberia is largely oriented towards our services offerings, of which our Outsourcing and Software Solutions activities performed particularly well in 2020, due to the revenue contribution from our largest customer, the expansion of our customer base among Financial Services customers and in our Software Solutions activity. Our VAR offering also performed well due to SME and public sector investment in remote working infrastructure. Excluding the IECISA Acquisition, revenue increased by €18.6 million over the period. In Iberia, in our Application Services, Infrastructure Services and Outsourcing activities, we experienced steady growth, thanks to the resilience of our TMT customers and our Public Sector and Healthcare customers to the effects of the pandemic. _BeLux_ BeLux accounted for €293.5 million and €294.8 million, or 18% and 15%, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Growth in BeLux revenue in 2020 was driven primarily by the strength of our offering to, and expertise with, large, public sector customers and performance in our Infrastructure Services, Business Solutions and VAR activities in Belgium for our robust portfolio of SME customers, which offset a decline in revenue in Luxembourg, due to declines in our VAR activity. _LatAm_ LatAm accounted for €43.9 million and €58.8 million, or 3% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Revenue in LatAm is driven largely by demand from large projects with our Public Sector and Healthcare and TMT customers. ----- _Other_ Our Other countries accounted for €79.0 million and €85.2 million, or 4.3%, of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Revenue in our Other countries increased over the period as a result of growth in Africa (particularly in Morocco, as well as from the acquisitions of I2S in Angola and Capital Consulting in Morocco), as well as by strong performance in Poland and Romania: in Poland, growth was supported by revenue from a large automotive industry customer and, in Romania, activity levels increased significantly in 2020. Staff costs Staff costs increased by €87.9 million, or 8.7%, from €1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by an increase in wages and salaries of increasing headcount. Operating expenses Operating expenses increased by €239.1 million, or 56.2%, from €425.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €664.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by the IECISA acquisition, the workforce of which included many subcontractors. Non-income taxes Non-income taxes increased by €3.5 million, or 24.4%, from €14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by wagebased taxes and is in line with the increase in wages. Amortization (other than goodwill) Amortization (other than goodwill) increased by €13.9 million, or 26.5%, from €52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by the IECISA contribution, which was split between non-IFRS amortization of intangible and tangible assets. Other underlying operating income and expenses Other underlying operating income and expenses decreased significantly by €3.0 million, from €3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Operating margin Operating margin increased by €23.2 million, or 23.1%, from €100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €123.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by revenue growth (as discussed above) largely due to the contribution of IECISA, which contributed €33.2 million to operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.20,Geographic Area Mix of Operating Margin,17.20.1,,"_France_ Operating margin from France increased slightly by €0.5 million, or 1.75%, from €28.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €29.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Profit expansion in the period translated into this slight increase of €0.5 million due to increased R&D amortization. Additionally, our French activity ratio in the six months ended June 30, 2022 helped to offset the impact of certain government grants that were received in the six months ended June 30, 2021, which were not renewed in the same period in 2022. The key contributors to operating margin improvements for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were our Application Services and Business Solutions activities. _Iberia_ Operating margin from Iberia increased by €6.9 million, or 33.3%, from €20.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €27.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase resulted from ----- improvements in Spain in our services offering, further savings at the direct margin level, a more optimized activity ratio thanks to growth and internal restructuring initiatives, a higher contribution from our VAR activity and tighter control over operating expenses in connection with the implementation of restructuring plans following our acquisition of IECISA _BeLux_ Operating margin from BeLux decreased by €7.5 million, or 43.8%, from €17.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €9.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as a result of reduced resources (both employees and subcontractors, due to higher turnover and more sick time taken) available for Application Services, along with lower demand in our Infrastructure Services activity. While VAR revenue increased, its contribution to operating margin decreased due to changes in mix (favoring software over hardware, due to shortages in the latter), while operating expenses were comparatively lower in the six months ended June 30, 2021, due to hiring delays. _LatAm_ Operating margin from LatAm increased by €7.0 million from €1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €8.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, in part due to performance in Mexico, where certain IECISA contracts were relatively low-margin. _Other_ Operating margin from our Other countries increased significantly by €2.4 million from €1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €4.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, in line with higher revenue in Eastern Europe including the contribution of JCommerce and reflecting the beginning of a recovery in Africa. Amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions Amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions decreased slightly by €0.1 million, or 1.8%, from €4.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs stayed largely consistent throughout the period under review, decreasing by €0.9 million, or 7.8%, from €11.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €10.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Restructuring costs during the six months ended June 30, 2022 consisted of a restructuring cost of €6.0 million in France (principally in relation to billables) and €3.2 million in Spain (principally in relation to billables and operating expenses). Gains (losses) on disposals Gains on disposals decreased from €2,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €49,000 of losses for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Other operating income and expenses Other operating expenses stayed largely consistent throughout the periods under review, decreasing by €0.1 million, or 2.1%, from €5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €4.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Operating profit Due to the factors described above, operating profit increased significantly by €10.4 million, or 21.4%, from €48.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €59.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Cost of net debt Cost of net debt decreased by €2.6 million, or 20.5%, from a loss of €12.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to a loss of €10.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This decrease was principally driven by reducing interest expense as a result of margin ratchet improvement, in connection with a better leverage ratio at the end of 2021. ----- Other financial income (expenses) Other financial income increased by €2.7 million, from an expense of €2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to an income of €0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was principally driven by favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased by €2.5 million, or 19.7%, from €12.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €15.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, in line with our profits before taxes. Net consolidated income Net consolidated income increased significantly by €13.2 million, or 62.6%, from €21.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, to €34.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, driven by the factors described above. _Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020_ The table below sets out the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. _France_ Operating margin from France increased significantly by €25.5 million, or 58.3%, from €43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of an increasing share of maintenance revenue from our Software Solutions activity and an improvement in activity ratio due to a return to historical levels following the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic, while our operating expenses were relatively stable, although impacted by higher bonuses. Operating margin improvement by activity and key drivers are as follows: - In our Application Services and Infrastructure Services activities, operating margin increased by €17.6 million and €3.7 million, respectively, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, in each case mostly driven by improved revenue and gross margin, due in turn to improved activity ratio and stable direct margin, slightly offset by increased operating expenses. - In our Business Solutions activity, operating margin increased by €5.8 million, driven by improved revenue and gross margin, due in turn to improved activity ratio and supported by stable direct margin, while operating expenses increased slightly over the period. - In our Outsourcing activity, operating margin decreased by €1.1 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, driven by decreases in revenue and gross margin, due in turn to changes in projects which negatively impacted direct margin, while operating expenses decreased over the period. - In our Software Solutions activity, operating margin increased by €6.3 million, driven by improved revenue and gross margin in regards to both licenses and maintenance, while operating expenses increased slightly over the period. _Iberia_ Operating margin from Iberia increased by €10 million, or 21.4%, from €46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of the integration ----- of IECISA and the implementation of synergies. Operating margin improvement in Iberia between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 was driven largely by the ongoing effects of the IECISA acquisition in Spain, reflecting savings initiatives, savings on subcontractor costs and other incremental savings and bottom-line growth driven by revenue growth and average selling price improvement, which were partially offset by additional management fees over the period. In Portugal, operating margin was supported by the strength of our various services offerings and, in particular, Cleva (an insurance software solution), which drove revenue, license business and average selling price improvement, which were partially offset by lower performances in our SAP business, due to a lack of new business. _BeLux_ Operating margin from BeLux increased by €4.8 million, or 21%, from €22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. While revenue in our Application Services and Infrastructure services activities increased, gross and direct margin remained stable over the period. The increase in operating margin was partially offset by significantly higher operating expenses in connection with sales and marketing to catch up on recruitment, travel and marketing activities. Operating margin improvement between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 in BeLux was driven primarily by activity in Belgium, particularly in our Application Services and Infrastructure Services activities, where direct margin and gross margin remained stable and activity ratio improved slightly. Our Software Solutions and Business Solutions activities also benefited from improved operating margin, while operating expenses was significantly higher in the period, primarily due to increased sales and marketing costs from delated recruiting efforts connected to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel expenses, as discussed above. _LatAm_ Operating margin from LatAm (after giving effect to the reclassification of IECISA branches) increased by €1.2 million, or 37.0%, from €3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of strong performance in Mexico, Colombia and Peru, which offset the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in other countries in LatAm. _Other_ Operating margin from our Other countries decreased slightly by €0.6 million, or 8.1%, from €7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of declines in Africa over the period, with Morocco underperforming as compared to historic levels and experiencing changes to planned projects, which were not completely offset by higher direct margins in our Eastern European operations (in particular in Romania and Poland) as well as Switzerland, due to improvements to delivery, customer mix and average selling price, while operating expenses increased slightly. Amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions Amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions increased by €1.7 million, or 22.9%, from €7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was driven principally by purchase price allocation in connection with the acquisition of IECISA. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs stayed largely consistent throughout the period under review, increasing by €0.1 million, or 0.6%, from €15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gains (losses) on disposals Gains on disposals decreased from €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other operating income and expenses Other operating expenses decreased significantly by €14.7 million, or 53.2%, from €27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was driven ----- principally by a significant depreciation of Kidiliz’s trade receivables associated with the termination of the Kidiliz contract, which is currently the subject of a dispute, amounting to €13.9 million. Operating profit Due to the factors described above, operating profit increased significantly by €52.3 million, or 70.9%, from €73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cost of net debt Cost of net debt decreased by €1.8 million, or 6.7%, from a loss of €26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to a loss of €24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was driven principally by reducing interest expense as a result of margin ratchet improvements, in connection with a better leverage ratio at the end of 2020 and June 2021. Other financial income (expenses) Other financial expenses increased significantly by €3.6 million, from €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was principally driven by favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Income tax expense Income tax expense decreased slightly by €1.1 million, or 3.9%, from €29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The reduction is mainly due to a decrease in the CVAE tax, pursuant to changed policy by the French government. Net consolidated income Net consolidated income increased significantly by €51.6 million, from €18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by the factors described above. _Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019_ The table below sets out the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. _France_ Operating margin from France decreased by €16.2 million, or 27.1%, from €59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the decline in revenue (as discussed above). Gross margins slightly decreased primarily due to a percentage point drop in our activity ratio in France, which was partly offset by government subsidies for partial unemployment and reduced expenses in the COVID-19 context. Our average selling price in France was broadly stable and not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. _Iberia_ Operating margin from Iberia grew significantly by €32.4 million from €14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the contribution of IECISA, which contributed €32.0 million to operating margin. Excluding the IECISA acquisition, operating margin increased by 2.8% over the period. The increase in operating margin was driven by the stabilization of the average selling price and the cost-base streamlining with IECISA. ----- _BeLux_ Operating margin from BeLux grew by €8.3 million, or 57.2%, from €14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, in line with activity and against a stable direct margin. _LatAm_ Operating margin from LatAm decreased by €0.5 million, or 14.4%, from €3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lower results in Brazil and Mexico, which were only partially offset by growth in Peru. _Other_ Operating margin from our Other countries decreased slightly by €0.8 million, from €8.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, to €7.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions Amortization of intangibles identified on acquisitions almost doubled, from €3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by the impact of the IECISA acquisition. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs increased significantly by €4.5 million, or 39.0%, from €11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by the costs associated with the IECISA acquisition. Gains (losses) on disposals Gains on disposals increased significantly by €1.1 million, from €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by the termination of certain activity in Spain. Other operating income and expenses Other operating expenses increased significantly by €27.1 million, from €0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by costs associated with the IECISA acquisition (€7.5 million) and the exceptional depreciation associated with the termination of the Kidiliz contract, which is currently the subject of a dispute (€13.9 million). Operating profit Due to the factors described above, operating profit decreased by €11.0 million, or 13.0%, from €84.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cost of net debt Cost of net debt increased significantly by €10.7 million, or 69.4%, from a loss of €15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to a loss of €26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by an increase in interest expense as a result of the new borrowings that we undertook in connection with the IECISA acquisition. Other financial income (expenses) Other financial expenses decreased significantly by €1.2 million, or 87.6%, from €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €173,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was principally driven by favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations in LatAm. Income tax expense Income tax expense increased by €4.7 million, or 19.1%, from €24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was principally driven by the contribution of IECISA. ----- Net consolidated income Net consolidated income decreased significantly by €25.2 million, or 57.9%, from €43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by the factors described above.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

We experienced lower activity in France due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, largely in our Application Services activity among our Financial Services and Industries customers, which was partially offset by performance in our Outsourcing, Infrastructure Services and Software Solutions activities, which are, overall, more digitalized activities, supported by strong recurring revenue from SME and public sector customers, as well as French government subsidies. Organic growth between the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 was limited at 2.4%, as we were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had differing impacts across the geographic areas in which we operate, with revenue in France decreasing overall, Iberia being relatively stable, BeLux and our Other countries continuing to grow.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.35,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.35.1,,"_Overview_ Historically, the principal sources of our liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, bank credit lines and bonds. We have also engaged in the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis in order to support our working capital and liquidity needs. Typically, receivables factored through non-recourse factoring transactions are written off from our financial statements upon their transfer, as all risks and benefits of the factored receivables are irrevocably transferred to the transferee. As at June 30, 2022, the amount of nonrecourse factored receivables excluded from our financial statements was €142.8 million. Following the completion of the Transactions, we intend to rely primarily on our operating cash flow, as well as our Revolving Credit Facility and the factoring of receivables to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” Historically, our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect that our principal uses of cash following the Transactions will be, to meet debt service requirements, provide working capital and fund capital expenditure. We believe that the current cash flow from operating activities, the Revolving Credit Facility and our nonrecourse factoring will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet current working capital needs. _Cash flows_ The table below sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

This decrease was mainly attributable to the fluctuation in change in working capital requirements for operations, from €117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to negative €34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This fluctuation is the result of, among others, €45.9 million in advance payments received from IECISA’s former shareholders, a decrease of €50 million under our non-recourse factoring arrangements, and some delayed social charges in connection with COVID-19 of €19.8 million.

Such commitments are shown at their nominal amounts in accordance with the related supporting documentation.

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.41,Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market and Financial Risks,17.41.1,,"_Overview_ In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to exchange rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Our operating and financial policies are aimed at minimizing potential effects on our financial performance by improving our economic results and net financial position. This discussion does not address other risks to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business, such as operational risks. See “Risk _Factors.” Exchange rate risk_ Our currency risk in respect of commercial transactions is not hedged, as most of our transactions are made within the euro zone, in euros. Outside of the euro zone, our revenue is generated in the currency of the relevant operating charges and few intercompany operating transactions are denominated in currencies other than the euro, thereby limiting exposure to foreign-exchange fluctuations. However, in light of current fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro to other currencies, our exposure may currently be higher than it has in the past, including in the periods under review. The impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 of a uniformly negative one centime change in the euro would total approximately €1 million. ----- _Credit risk_ Our credit risk mainly relates to trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents. Our exposure to credit risk is largely limited to failures of third parties, with a maximum exposure equal to the book value of the relevant instrument. The risk associated with trade receivables is assessed based on an analysis of receivables due and not impaired, which are continuously monitored. Regarding receivables transferred to our non-recourse factoring arrangements, insurance has been taken out to cover the risk of non-payment. _Liquidity risk_ Liquidity risk is the risk associated with the ability to meet commitments arising from financial liabilities. We have short and long-term debt. Prudent management of the liquidity risk arising from normal operations requires the maintenance of an adequate level of cash and the availability of funds obtainable through an adequate number of appropriately-sized credit lines. We further mitigate liquidity risk by ensuring that we have access to different sources of financing with different banking institutions and that there are no significant concentrations of liquidity risk on the side of both financial assets and the sources of financing. We also use non-recourse factoring arrangements and bank overdraft facilities to mitigate this risk. The medium to long-term debt structure used to finance our acquisitions and the availability of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and other long-term bank debt enable us to optimize the sources and application of funds and support us in developing our business. _Interest rate risk_ Our exposure to interest risk mainly derives from the volatility of financial charges in relation to debt, expressed at a variable rate. Fluctuations in market interest rates may affect our results, indirectly affecting costs and returns of financing and investment transactions. After completion of the Transactions, we will continue to be exposed to interest rate risk in connection with the Senior Facilities. The strategy that we follow for this type of risk mitigation is one that aims at mitigating interest rate risk while optimizing debt cost. Our main objective when managing this risk is to minimize the cost of debt, while guarding against fluctuations in interest rates. As such, we intend to hedge, within certain limits, an increase in the 3-month EURIBOR rate.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.42,Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates,17.42.1,,"_Critical accounting policies_ The preparation of financial statements requires our management to apply accounting principles and methods which, in certain circumstances, are based on difficult and subjective assessments and estimates based on historical experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable from time to time and realistic according to the relative circumstances. The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and other information provided in this Offering Memorandum. The final results of the Financial Statement items for which such estimates and assumptions have been used may differ from those reported in the Financial Statements due to the uncertainty that characterizes the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based. The areas that require more subjectivity on the part of management in preparing the estimates, and for which a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions used could have a significant impact on the financial data, include the measurement of retirement benefit plans, testing of goodwill for impairment, provisions for liabilities and charges and the recoverability of deferred tax assets, each of which are described further below. _Measurement of retirement benefit plans_ Estimates are required in the accounting for defined benefit pension plans, including establishing discount rates, rates of increase in salaries and pensions in payment, inflation and mortality assumptions. These estimates are made by management based on the advice of qualified advisors. Details of the assumptions used and the sensitivity of the benefit obligation to these assumptions are set out in Note 4.3 (Retirement Benefit _Plans) to the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 that are included elsewhere_ in this Offering Memorandum. _Testing of goodwill for impairment_ In accordance with IFRS, we assess whether goodwill has been impaired each year, or more frequently when there is an indication that it may have been impaired. The recoverable amount of the cash generating units has been calculated based on calculations of the value in use. These calculations require the use of estimates. ----- _Provisions for liabilities and charges_ Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognized to cover specific liabilities that are certain or probable, but whose amount or due date is unknown at the reporting date. Specifically, provisions for liabilities relate to specific liabilities whose occurrence is probable and amount estimated, while provisions for charges relate to specific liabilities, whose occurrence is certain and amount or due date estimated, that arise from obligations already taken on at the reporting date but which will be paid in subsequent years. Accruals to provisions for liabilities and charges are primarily recognized in the profit and loss account section to which the transaction relates, privileging the classification of costs by nature. The amount of the accruals to the provisions is based on the best estimate of costs, including the legal expenses, at each reporting date and is not discounted. Moreover, in estimating accruals to provisions for charges, we may consider the related time horizon, if a reasonable estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation and its due date is possible and the latter is so far into the future that the obligation’s present value and estimated liability will be considerably different at that settlement date. If the measurement of the accruals gives a range of values, the accrual represents the best possible estimate between the upper and lower thresholds of the range. The provisions are subsequently used directly and solely for those costs and liabilities for which they were originally set up. If they are not sufficient or are redundant, the shortfall or surplus is recognized in the profit and loss account in line with the original accrual. _Recoverability of deferred tax assets_ The recoverability of deferred tax assets is subject to the achievement of sufficiently large future taxable profits for the absorption of the aforementioned tax losses or to the competition of the deferred taxation connected to the other deferred tax assets. Significant management judgments are required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized in the financial statements based on the timing and amount of future taxable income. In particular, it should be noted that deferred tax assets have been recorded on past tax losses for the portion estimated recoverable against future taxable income shown in our updated strategic plans, also as a consequence of the fact that the tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. _Revenue recognition policy_ We recognize revenue as follows: Technical assistance, consulting and systems integration billed at cost plus Revenue arising from these services is recognized as and when the services are rendered. Revenue is determined by reference to the contractually agreed price and to billable chargeable hours spent on the job. Invoices to be raised or deferred income are recognized when billing is out of phase with the stage of completion. Services invoiced for a fixed amount Revenue arising from these services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion based on costs incurred to date and costs that will be incurred subsequently. When it is probable that costs will exceed revenue, the expected loss is recognized immediately. Invoices to be raised or deferred income are recognized when billing is out of phase with the stage of completion. Systems integration associated with sales of software packages and hardware In general, the turnover of the two services is recognized separately. The part of the income relating to the software packages and materials is recorded during the delivery to the customer (transfer of control). The revenue of the integration service is recognized over time, based on costs incurred and costs remaining to be incurred. However, for license sales including a so-called complex integration, the software / hardware and integration constitute a single service. The corresponding overall income is recorded based on the costs incurred and the costs still to come. Sales of software and hardware For sales of software packages and hardware made independently of any service, the turnover is recognized when the control is transferred to the customer. Maintenance The turnover relating to these services is recorded on a pro rata basis over the duration of the contract. Transactions carried out as an agent When we act as an agent, the revenue relating to the transaction is not recognized. Only the margin achieved from such transactions is recorded under “Revenue.” -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The Consulting activity is structured around two types of consulting: (a) strategy and management consulting and (b) digital and innovation consulting focused on digital transformation (our primary focus). The latter includes projects specifically designed for CIOs and CxOs (including in expertise areas such as cybersecurity, data/AI, process automation and cloud computing). In 2019, within our key markets, the Consulting activity accounted for approximately €7.0 billion in revenue. Despite a contraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic to an estimated €6.6 billion in 2021, growth in revenue is expected to resume at an estimated 8.8% CAGR during the period from 2021 to 2025, faster than pre-pandemic levels. Growth in Consulting is expected to be generated from customers’ need for upstream support, complexity management and digital transformation, led by both IT departments and business areas; “Application Services”: This consists of build-and-run activities, ranging from planning, specification and design to custom software development, packaged software implementation, integration of applications, all the way to maintenance and enhancement of existing applications. In 2019, within our key markets, the Application Services activity accounted for approximately €18.5 billion in revenue. After a brief contraction to an estimated €18.4 billion in 2021, revenue are forecasted to rebound strongly and grow at a CAGR of 8.3% during the period from 2021 to 2025. Growth is expected to be driven by customers’demand for build activities around new digital solutions and their transition to cloud-supported infrastructure; “Infrastructure Services”: This includes workplace support services such as field services, services desk, hardware maintenance, cloud services, cybersecurity and related activities. Infrastructure Services also encompass customization, integration of infrastructure products, and infrastructure managed services, such as data center outsourcing, hosting and management. Services can be catered to both public and private cloud-based environments. In 2019, within our key markets, the Infrastructure Services activity accounted for approximately €17.8 billion in revenue, and briefly contracted to an estimated €17.3 billion in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While forecasted growth is not expected to be as substantial as Consulting, the Infrastructure Services market is still expected to grow at a moderate pace at an estimated CAGR of 3.8% for the period from 2021 to 2025, mainly driven by infrastructure managed services; and ----- “Other”: This includes network services and hardware support.

Full-fledged digital transformations have led to a significant increase in IT expenditure globally. From customer-facing activities to internal reorganization processes, enterprises and other organizations are allocating an increasing portion of their related expenditure to the deployment of core digital technologies (e.g., cloud, AI, cybersecurity) as well as to the modernization of their underlying technology stack, legacy systems and infrastructure. As a result, IT has become mission critical for enterprises, capturing significant mindshare at the board level and shifting responsibilities from the CIOs (Chief Information Officers) to CxOs (Chief Experience Officers), and of increasing importance for other organizations, including public sector entities, as part of delivering their services and performing their mandates. Demand for independent, third-party digital transformation service providers like Inetum is underpinned by the increasing complexity of digital technology solutions, lack of skilled resources and a focus on cost-effectiveness. Our customers’ tech and IT architecture is becoming increasingly complex and requires additional support to design and interoperate both legacy systems and new digital solutions. With an acute shortage of skilled resources at their disposal, our customers increasingly rely on us for all their digital transformation needs. Along the same lines, our customers face ever growing pressure to allocate limited IT resources and drive cost efficiencies while optimizing investments and operating costs. In response, digital transformation service providers have adapted their business models by acquiring new capabilities, expanding their portfolio and industrializing their delivery system. They are bolstering internal capabilities through (i) “acqui-hiring” (i.e., purchasing companies in order to acquire their employees), especially with respect to next-gen technologies such as cloud, cybersecurity, CX, and RPA; (ii) venturing upstream into Consulting to support end-to-end digital transformation and to enable downstream business origination through CxOs; and (iii) industrializing and automating their operating models through shared service centers with service and quality commitments. We believe that the key countries in which we operate, France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal, from which we derived 89% of revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, are large and ripe for digitalization. The IT services market in these key geographic markets is expected to grow from an estimated size of €46.1 billion in 2021 to €58.7 billion in 2025, which represents a CAGR of 6.2%, with most of the growth stemming from Application Services and Consulting activities. We offer our customers a broad set of IT services and solutions spanning the entire value chain, both upstream and downstream of the IT lifecycle. Our key activities include Consulting, Infrastructure Services and Application Services. The Consulting activity is upstream within the pre-design phase, whilst Application Services and Infrastructure Services span the entire value chain from build to run activities. We also offer proprietary software solutions and distribute hardware and software products, which are covered in subsequent sections. The following charts illustrate the split of the IT services market in our key markets, by geographic market and by activity segments. ----- _IT services market in our key markets by geography and activity segments, 2016-2025E Source: Company information and estimates._",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

As set forth in the graph below, the global IT services market has broadly grown by 3 – 5% per year over the long term, even during periods of economic disruptions. While growth in IT services slowed globally after the global financial crisis, it rebounded at the start of 2015 and has accelerated since 2021. This new phase of growth is spurred by digital and cloud transformation trends. The increasing complexity and mission-critical nature of IT services, alongside increased reliance on IT services providers for all digitalization needs have greatly added to the underlying resilience in performance through economic cycles and downturns. ----- _Global IT services market ($ billion) (1996–2021) Sources: Bain Capital analysis, with use of IMF and World Bank data._ As shown below, IT services expenditure within our key markets as a percentage of GDP is lower compared to the other major European countries as well as the United States, indicating a degree of structural underpenetration in such markets. For instance, countries such as France and Spain had IT services expenditure as a percentage of GDP at 1.4% and 1.5% in 2019, respectively. This would suggest that these countries are still relatively at the early stages of their shift to cloud-based services and solutions. We believe this underpenetration is an indicator of a forward growth trajectory as both private and public sector customers continue to increase their IT investments to remain competitive and fill the technology gap that currently exists in comparison with other major economies. We believe the runway for the current wave of growth within our key markets is long, with most CIOs projecting the market to stabilize at higher growth levels in the future. _IT services expenditure as % of GDP, 2019_ 2.9% 2.1% 1.9% 1.8% 1.8% 1.8% 1.6% 1.5% 1.4% 1.2% 1.0% UK US Finland NetherlandsDenmark Belgium Sweden Spain France Portugal Italy _Source: Company, Bain Capital, analysis using IMF data._",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

To thrive and ensure agile delivery models, organizations are strongly incentivized to invest in their technology infrastructure and offerings. Investment in IT services should be deployed in response to evolving customer needs, boost development pace and delivery times, as well as move existing infrastructure to the cloud. This trend is expected to create lasting opportunities for IT services providers as most public and private organizations are still in the first phase of this transformation. _Increasing complexity_ The IT architecture constitutes the backbone of organizations’ business operations (processes and functions), business applications and databases and the equipment and services that run the applications. Traditional product development was driven largely by hardware considerations. With the surge of digital applications, today’s tech-enabled products depend on the successful integration of multiple hardware and software components, which makes their development a multidimensional and highly complex process. Integrations can be difficult and unpredictable due to the complexity and intricate nature of software IT infrastructure. Acquired technologies are typically developed independently and may not have been designed to integrate existing products. Such difficulties are compounded when products involved are well established, as compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

A brief description of the French enterprise Software Solutions market and the Value-Added Reselling activity is provided below. _French enterprise Software Solutions market_ The software solutions activity covers activities from design, distribution to maintenance of software packages for enterprises and other organizations. The market for software solutions can be categorized into Infrastructure and Applications Software. Infrastructure Software is designed for IT professionals to run and manage the performance of IT resources. Applications Software is split in two categories—Horizontal Software that are typically industry-agnostic and targeted to a wide audience of business users and functions such as human resources, sales and accounting and, Vertical Specific Software (VSS) that are industryspecific and cover core and non-core business processes with limited replicability across industries. We mostly address the VSS market. _French enterprise software solutions market (€ billion) (2016 – 2020) CAGR 16A-19A CAGR 16A-20A_ **+8.1%** **+5.7%** 3.9 3.9 **+4.4% 3.7 5.9 5.7 **+7.3% 4.3 4.8 5.2 **+5.1%** 5.0 5.2 5.5 6.1 6.1 2016A 2017A 2018A 2019A 2020A Infrastructure applications Horizontal applications Vertical specific software In France, as of 2019, revenue from the software solutions market was approximately €16.4 billion, having grown at a CAGR of 8.1% during the period from 2016 to 2019, roughly in line with global trends. The COVID-19 pandemic has moderately impacted the market, with revenue decreasing by 1.5% from 2019 to 2020. In this regard, the software solutions market is more resilient compared to our other activities, as software faces greater exposure to the acceleration of digitalization efforts as increased software rollout is required to support remote working, e-learning, telehealth, and other essential digital services. While all categories of the software solutions market grew at healthy rates from 2016 to 2019, horizontal applications grew at faster rates, driven by more overall equipment, higher adoption of SaaS solutions, and move from custom specific to commercial off-the-shelf solutions. The VSS category, which we mostly address, had estimated revenue of €4.4 billion in 2020, representing approximately 27% of the total software solutions market. The Financial Services and Public Sector and Healthcare industry verticals were the largest VSS sub-categories and delivered sustained growth during the period from 2016 to 2020. The market for French VSS is expected to accelerate during the period from 2021 to 2025 and is forecasted to grow at CAGR of 10.4% to reach an estimated size of €7.2 billion. All the key industry verticals sub-categories are expected to show significant growth, but at varying levels. Financial Services, Public Healthcare and Retail Consumer Good are expected to experience some of the highest growth rates, with forecasted CAGRs of 10.6%, 11.9% and 12.7%, respectively, during the period from 2021 to 2025. While the growth in Public Healthcare-specific software is expected to be driven by digitalization efforts, Financial Services-specific software growth is expected to stem from the need for standardized solutions in business processes and from the increasing development of fit-for-purpose solutions.

This shift is justified by high upfront development costs, potential for mutualization and reliability of market solutions. Concurrently, enterprises are moving from on-premises software to SaaS, which has become a market standard for new solutions. In addition, continuous innovation around digital solutions, coupled with new go-to-market strategies through development of market partnerships, are creating new business opportunities around SMACS, especially analytics and artificial intelligence offerings. _Value-Added Reselling (VAR)_ VAR represents an upselling opportunity for IT services providers and consists of various valuable services to end-customers. VAR includes distribution activities for both hardware and software, including training, personalization, and installation: - Distribution of software and hardware products, intermediating software publishers and hardware equipment manufacturers to end-customers. Value-Added Resellers often have structured partnerships with manufacturers, ensuring higher trust from customers and guarantee of better access to services (e.g., technical support); - Advice on hardware and software packaging to meet customers’ needs and on technical ecosystem; - Personalization and installation: VAR can take care of software configurations but also create product bundles (e.g., combination of vertical-specific software and hardware along with turnkey hardware and installed software solutions); and - Training customers to understand the functionality behind the IT architecture. Value-Added Resellers act as key intermediaries between manufacturers and end-customers. On one hand, manufacturers enjoy an increased customer base reach at a lower search cost given the scattered SME market. On the other hand, Value-Added Resellers represent a one-stop-shop with both material and procurement installation. The revenue model varies depending on the type of service sold (e.g., one-off margins applied in the event of a products sale, recurring commission fee on software subscriptions and additional revenue coming from extra services such as support or training).",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

While technical capabilities are considered in line with market average for large companies in France, they fall slightly lower than the average in some sectors in Spain where global majors have the upper hand. For mid-market companies in Spain, we believe we are perceived to possess deep technical and delivery capabilities. This combination of broad technical capabilities and local footprint gives us a structural advantage over both global majors and smaller local providers. On the one hand, we are nimbler and customer-centric while offering the full suite of IT services like global majors. On the other hand, we also guarantee high quality of service alongside deep sector expertise, unlike smaller providers in the market. We believe that the combination of these characteristics represents a significant barrier to entry for foreign competitors. The chart above shows the market share of each type of IT services providers in key European markets in 2019. As illustrated in the graph below, low-cost Indian operators (which play a key role in some IT services markets) have a limited presence in France and are virtually absent in Spain, which are two of our key markets. As a result, this limits competitive pressure from Indian operators in markets that are otherwise fairly fragmented across global, local, mid-tier and other operators. In addition, multi-local providers have some of the highest market share in key markets, similar to local branches of major global IT providers, demonstrating our strong competitive positioning across our key geographic markets. _Market share by type of provider, (%) (2019) Source: Company and Bain Capital analysis._ In addition to the market-specific attributes listed above, our competitiveness is driven by three internal levers, which are in line with industry best practices. Firstly, we are gradually transitioning to a vertical sales ----- organization, offering sectorial expertise and increased relevance to customers and potentially leading to increased wins and further upselling (especially in France and in the Financial Services industry vertical). This transition is in line with global majors’ organizational structure set up. Secondly, we are improving our performance in talent attraction with further room for improvement to recruit top experts and program managers, while retention is on par with best performers. Finally, we have strong established partnerships with major editors and global software providers (for example, SAP, Sage, Microsoft, Salesforce and Oracle).

Four archetypes of providers compete in the IT services market, and they are divided based on providers’ footprint, value chain positioning and technological know-how: - Global majors represent global IT services providers with worldwide footprint and deep capabilities across most industry verticals and technologies. Global majors possess the largest portfolio of capabilities on the market with a wide array of product and service offerings. Key global majors include Accenture, Capgemini, Atos and IBM; ----- - Multi-local generalists represent generalist IT services providers with regional footprint and higher customer proximity and intimacy. Multi-local generalists include Sopra, Indra, NTT Data and us; - Local providers are characterized by local footprint and integrated activities with focus on costs and efficiencies. Examples of local providers include Ayesa, Infotel, NRB and Neurones; and - Vertical or Functional specialists are local or international providers with a focus on a specific industry or technology (e.g., cybersecurity), usually with higher digital maturity. Specialists are good M&A candidates as they typically fill a gap in the portfolio of service offerings. Key providers in the space include Devoteam, HR Path and Cloudreach. We are positioned as a multi-local generalist, competing against global majors and other providers within the IT services market. Nevertheless, we do not have the same positioning on main IT activities. While global majors enjoy the largest portfolio of capabilities, multi-local generalists like us benefit from a strong foothold and customer intimacy in key geographies. Global majors have a multinational footprint with exposure to multiple businesses. They also enjoy higher levels of performance, with approximately 13% (non-weighted) average adjusted operating margin in 2019, compared to approximately 7% for multi-local generalists. This performance premium is driven by a favorable business mix coupled with higher average daily rates (ADR); in addition to industrialized delivery capabilities with cost advantage in offshore location and scale effect optimization (e.g., better leverage of global pyramid). Market shares are relatively stable organically, with substantial changes only explained by M&A activity such as the acquisition of Galitt in 2017 by Sopra Steria, or the acquisition of Silvio and Sutter Mills by Accenture in 2019. These dynamics grant us with a relatively protected market structure. Furthermore, our key markets is characterized by unique attributes, which constitute significant barriers to entry for potential foreign competitors: - Customer proximity and intimacy, which allows IT services providers to be responsive to their customers’ needs. We have approximately 40 sites in France and are present in the 12 largest cities; - Strong historical relationships with local customers, in addition to the complexities and high costs normally associated with switching existing IT services providers. Inetum is one-stop shop for fast-growing mid-market customers; - Deep knowledge of local market dynamics, regulatory dynamics and providers’ ecosystems; - Language barriers in each of the countries in which we operate represent an important advantage to domestic providers vis-à-vis foreign competitors; and - Deeply entrenched and mission-critical offerings for regulated and technical customer organizations, especially in the energy and healthcare sectors.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

SMACS (Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud, Security) have a key area of growth. For example, in the French IT services market (including IaaS and business consulting), revenue from SMACS grew at a CAGR of 15.6% from 2015 to 2019. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the French market negatively in 2020, SMACS demonstrated strong resiliency by growing during the same period. Each of the SMACS areas are described below: (i) _Social:_ This represents social networks and internal communication channels, disrupting traditional models of workplace by connecting people and enabling them to work collaboratively. Examples include the implementation of collaborative solutions such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, spurred by the trend towards working from home. (ii) Mobility: This refers to mobile applications allowing users to connect anytime and anywhere to traditional services. Mobile applications cover custom mobile apps with strong user interfaces across various verticals and functions. Examples include but are not limited to banking apps, insurance apps and data synchronization platforms. (iii) Analytics: This refers to big data analytics for businesses, which gives the ability to process, extract and use knowledge from data sources such as social media sites, GPS-based tracking systems, point of sale equipment and Machine Learning. Google Analytics is a primary example that enables users to measure advertising ROI and track website traffic, amongst other functions. (iv) Cloud: This encompasses cloud computing services such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Network-as-a-Service (NaaS). Cloud can be public or hybrid (public and private cloud servers mix). Cloud IT services offerings include moving legacy infrastructure to the cloud, re-platforming, and integration of cloud native SaaS solutions. AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are primary examples of cloud computing platforms that provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools. Cloud is the key contributor within SMACS, for example, with a market size of €6.7 billion in 2020 in France (approximately 45% of the French SMACS estimated revenue). (v) _Security:_ This refers to cybersecurity and its integration within organizations’ operating models to protect against digital attacks. Cybersecurity is now essential to data and privacy protection. Examples of IT services offerings include testing capabilities, access and identity management implementation, as well as personal data protection. Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet are good examples of leading cybersecurity solution providers. The following chart shows the share of legacy infrastructure and applications in the Spanish IT services market (including IaaS and business consulting) in 2020. ----- _Digitalization Trends Across Industry Verticals—share of legacy infrastructure and applications in Spain, 2020_ **85% 75%** **75% 60% 55%55% 50%50% < 10%< 10%** Middle office Back officeMiddle office Back office OverallOverall OSSOSS Non-OSSNon-OSS Core systemCore systysysysyyysyyysysyyysysysysysysysysyysysyyssssssss em ProcessProcess (1) Operations Support Systems (computer systems used by telecommunications service providers to manage their network). Legacy projects still represent approximately 65% of the total IT services market (including IaaS and business consulting) in France and Spain. In some industry verticals, the share of legacy technology and applications is quite high. For example, the share of legacy technology and applications in the Spanish public sector was estimated to be approximately 85% in 2020. In addition, revenue from the Financial Services industry vertical in the IT services market in our key markets is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.6% from 2021 to 2025, and the Public—Healthcare industry vertical is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% during the same period. This highlights our key markets’ potential to grow as industry verticals continue to transform and achieve greater digital maturity. _Increased IT outsourcing across all geographies Internal vs. External IT services expenditure in our key geographies (€ billion; %) (2016 – 2019)_ **60% 55%55% 50%50% < 10%< 10%** Middle office Back officeMiddle office Back office OverallOverall OSSOSS Non-OSSNon-OSS Core systemCore systysysysyyysyyysysyyysysysysysysysysyysysyyssssssss em ProcessProcess _France_ 37.4 39.4 37% 34% 63% 66% 2016 2019 **60% 55%55% 50%50% < 10%< 10%** _Spain_ 20.0 17.2 32% **+3.3% 34% 66% 68% **+6.2% 2016 2019 External Internal _Belgium_ 8.7 7.7 26% 25% 74% 75% 2016 2019 CAGR 16-19 _Portugal_ 2.7 2.4 42% 41% 58% 59% 2016 2019 _Note: Internal services includes internal IT staff_ Traditionally, companies have outsourced their business processes mainly to achieve cost savings efficiencies. In recent years, outsourcing has further evolved to encompass more sophisticated IT services offerings because of customers’ greater demand for digital products and services. While overall IT expenditure is growing in our key geographies, the share of external expenditure is growing slightly faster than the share of internal expenditure in these same geographies. For example, during the period from 2016 to 2019, the share of IT services which were outsourced externally in France and Spain increased from 63% and 66% to reach 66% and 68%, respectively. Four main drivers are fueling this transformation: (i) _Cost base variabilization:_ the pooling of resources within industrialized service centers. (ii) Quality requirements: beyond cost improvement, the need for commitment to service quality levels and overall end-user engagement, with a focus on managed services offerings. (iii) Delivery risk reduction: the need to access rare skilled resources to handle new tech-intensive demands contributing to the growth of industrialized and highly productive delivery models for IT services providers (e.g., managed services and cross-shoring (offshoring for cost efficiency, re-shoring or nearshoring for customer proximity and further responsiveness)). ----- (iv) IT department role switch: as businesses’ back-end operations increase in complexity, the role of the IT department has moved from that of a solution provider to one of pilot and architect supervising outsourced operations. _Permanent COVID-19 impact_ The COVID-19 pandemic has permanently altered the way businesses and society operate. According to a study conducted by a consulting company, the pandemic propelled society five years forward in consumer and business digital adoption. Effectively, remote working and virtual meetings are expected to remain part of the working culture (albeit being used less intensely than at the pandemic’s peak), digital transformations have accelerated and the adoption of automation and AI has increased. According to a survey in the EU and US at the end of 2020 conducted by a market-leading consultancy, approximately 52% of survey respondents anticipate a permanent increase in the use of collaboration tools solutions, such as voice, video, messaging and project management tools. This is followed by 46% and 37% of respondents expecting such an increase in network security and capacity, and identification and access management, respectively. With the rise of the digital transition and the adoption of new solutions, the need for move-to-cloud services has significantly increased. The share of location of application workloads on public cloud in the US and the US is forecasted to reach 42% in 2023, up from 23% in 2018. _Expected permanent increase in IT Solutions and expected location of application workloads_",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

We are one of the preferred suppliers for many European blue-chip companies, which have significant digitalization and legacy transformation needs and require IT service providers like us that have at-scale delivery capabilities. On the other hand, mid-market customers require a combination of broad technical capabilities, flexibility and a local footprint. Our customers value our consistent quality, the breadth of our IT services and solutions that are tailored to their needs, our understanding of local market characteristics and our comprehensive suite of offerings. We believe that these factors, along with our active management of relationships with our customers, contribute to our consistently high customer satisfaction rates (approximately 90% in France in the year ended December 31, 2021 according to customer satisfaction surveys that we perform at the end of projects on a continuous basis), which we believe contributes to our increasing contract renewal rates (calculated on the basis of the total value of existing contracts rolled forward in any given year), which in France have been at or above 90% since 2019 and at 95% for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the longevity of our customer relationships (almost all of our top ten customers from 2012 were still within our top 16 customers in 2021). We have been serving more than half of our top ten customers for more than ten years, with some relationships dating back to 1995, and our revenue from our top ten customers has grown at a CAGR of approximately 4% ----- over the past ten years, with eight out of ten customers generating higher absolute revenue in 2021 and a relatively similar operating margin over that same period. At the same time, we benefit from low customer concentration and significant customer diversification across our industry verticals. In 2021, our top customer, top ten customers and top 35 customers accounted for 2.7%, 17.5% and 35.3% of our revenue, respectively. We believe that this diversity increases our resilience to periods of economic uncertainty and other fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which we operate.

Our services and solutions include both those that are tailored to specific industry verticals and those that are transversal in nature, _i.e., those that span industry verticals by catering to common problems, including for example, our activity,_ time and content management solutions. For example, in our Public Sector and Healthcare industry vertical, we have tailored and refined our services and solutions for over 40 years to become a privileged partner to more than 3,000 public organizations, (i) providing consulting services focused on digital and open government models, digital education, re-engineering and automation of public procurement processes and property management adoption, (ii) improving the citizen experience with a public/social CRM, citizen and transparency portals, and open data platforms and (iii) shaping smart territories with our intelligent city solutions. In the Financial Services industry vertical, we provide innovative offerings including (i) IT services relating to funds administration, payments and settlements solutions, regulatory compliance, risk management and credit management, (ii) compliance solutions to insurance customers with over €14.0 billion in assets managed, helping them monitor approximately 14 million property and casualty contracts, which cover over 8 million individuals and (iii) instant payments and cash management evolution and integration to help expand digital payments usage. In addition to these services, we offer powerful proprietary IP Software Solutions for Public Sector customers, which differentiates our offering in areas such as finance, HR, school transport, intelligent and collaborative territories, social protection, taxation and management of urban planning and housing, emergency medical services, fire services and emergency management. We believe that our business benefits from a relatively high proportion of our operating revenue being generated by sales of Software Solutions based on our own proprietary software or other IP. In 2021, sales from our Software Solutions accounted for 8% of our total revenue. We believe that, in addition to generating recurring revenue and increasing operational leverage, IP-rich software solutions tend to strengthen customer relationships and support strong customer retention, which can enable cross-selling and up-selling of additional services and software, and enhance margins. We have also been investing in strengthening and growing our digital capabilities to cater to the increasing demand for such services and solutions, with digital services and solutions across our services and solutions accounting for approximately 40% of our total contract value for the year ended December 31, 2020. Some of our digital services and solutions include advisory in digital transformation, digital customer experience customization, digital workplace transformation, contract modernization, cloud migration, virtualization and maintenance, data analytics, cybersecurity solutions, and robotic process automation. Finally, we are a long-standing partner of market leading software and cloud vendors for workplace solutions (including Red Hat, Oracle and ServiceNow), data center and multi-cloud providers (including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure) and network and security providers (including Palo Alto Networks).

These have been key factors to our above-market growth over the years. By leveraging our resilient and flexible business model through economic downturns, we have demonstrated our ability to maintain profitability while expanding our business through a combination of organic and acquisition-led growth. The following graphics show the evolution of our organic and reported revenue, margins and cash flow conversion over time, demonstrating our ability to produce above-market revenue growth, both organically and inorganically, while achieving stable margins and with improving cash flow conversion in the long term. ----- _Source: Company information_ (1) Organic and Pro Forma Revenues are both rebased to 100, based on 2011 figures; (2) Adjusted for 3SI and Kidiliz contracts ramp down impact.

We have historically maintained margin discipline, suggesting experience and multiple strategies to deal with cost inflation via pass-through to customers (especially in high growth areas), better cost optimization (reallocation of staff across customers and projects, use nearshoring or freelance) and productivity improvements (employment of lean industrialization techniques). We believe that the upwards evolution of our revenue, margins and cash flow conversion over time are mainly driven by our strong structural foundation and highly attractive underlying business model. We increased our operating margin as a percentage of revenue from 6.3% in 2019 to 7.4% in 2021, due to our strong recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, notably in relation to our activity ratio. Our operating margin as a percentage of revenue further improved to 7.6% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, as a result of certain efficiency measures that we are in the process of implementing. In addition to a well-diversified revenue base and an attractive mix of blue-chip and mid-market customers, we have benefited from stable profit margins in recent years, driven by various efficiency measures targeting our portfolio mix and contributing to growth in our direct margin. Furthermore, our asset-light business model has further enhanced cash flow conversion, which increased from 56.8% in 2016 to 77.5% in 2021. Our capital expenditure level is also relatively low, representing 2.3%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our financial policy is to maintain strong cash flow conversion, with a target of at least 70%, in the medium term. While we believe we will be able to accomplish this, our ability to do so will depend on various factors, many of which are not within our control. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve any such results in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

In part thanks to our acquisition strategy, we generated €2.3 billion in revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and have generated approximately €1.0 billion of additional revenue from companies that we have acquired since 2016 (calculated by aggregating revenue contribution of each acquired company solely in the year of their respective acquisition, on a _pro forma basis as if the acquisition was completed on January 1 of the relevant financial year) in the year of_ their respective acquisition. ----- We constantly evaluate opportunities for prudent, highly-targeted and strategic bolt-on acquisitions, focused on the expansion of both of our services and solutions portfolio and geographic reach. As part of our expansion of our offerings, our acquisitions include Cognitis, a banking services and consulting specialist, IVS, a public sector software specialist, Addstones, a corporate and investment bank specialist, Itn, Inservio and i2s, insurance software and services experts, Novulys, a Microsoft CRM specialist, Projixi Europe, an automation specialist, and Ilex International, a cybersecurity software provider. As part of our geographic expansion, our acquisitions include IECISA, Efron and Gesfor, which allowed us to significantly expand our business in Spain and LatAm, Realdolmen, which allowed us to expand in the BeLux market, Impaq, which allowed us to enter the Polish market with high-tech nearshoring capabilities, and Do IT Wise, which allowed us to capitalize on the success of ServiceNow and further expand our service center capabilities. In addition, in Africa, we acquired Somafor, which allowed us to enter the Ivory Coast market, Archos Technology and Capital Consulting, which allowed us to consolidate our leading position in Morocco, Cynapsys, which allowed us to enter the Tunisian market and increase our offshore shared service center capacities and which we capitalized on by acquiring HLi Consulting in 2021. We are experienced in integrating assets and driving cost efficiencies and cross-selling synergies, as demonstrated by the seamless integration and success of our acquired companies. For example, in relation to IECISA, which we acquired in 2020, we have already exceeded our initial objectives and delivered more than €20 million of savings by improving billables and optimizing the costs of certain non-billables, such as property, plant and equipment, general and administrative expenses and subcontracting expense.

Our senior managers include Vincent Rouaix, who has been our CEO since 2009 and Cyril Malher, who has been our CFO since 2009, each of whom has over 20 years of experience in the IT services market. In addition to our CEO and CFO, the rest of our management team has an average experience of ten years in the IT services market. Under their management, our business is well-positioned to deliver strong growth and successfully implement our growth and transformation strategy. We also have a strong and proven track record of attracting and retaining best-in-class talent, which are at the heart of innovation in our business. As of June 30, 2022, we had more than 27,000 FTEs, the majority of whom are consultants and direct employees, with 4,100 subcontractors, 946 freelancers, dedicated research teams of 150 professionals and a pool of 300 engineers focused on innovation. We are always looking for ways to help our talent with their training and professional development, with more than 10,000 employees and consultants trained, accredited and certified in 2021 by our long-term partners, such as Google and Microsoft. In part due to our strong focus on talent development and focus on innovation, a significant portion of our FTEs remain with us for a long term, with approximately 40% of our FTEs having worked for us for five years or more, and the average tenure of our FTEs for the year ended December 31, 2021 being approximately seven years. We believe that our strong focus on talent development and investment in innovation sets us apart from our competitors. From the year ended December 31, 2019, to the year ended December 31, 2021, we invested a total of approximately €167 million in R&D. Such investments and our large number of long-serving and well-trained FTEs provide a significant barrier to entry into the market for new competitors, who would need to invest a significant amount of time and money to gain such a workforce and similarly innovate. Such barriers to entry also help us maintain profitability while we pursue growth. In addition, we benefit from the expertise, business relationships and knowledge of Bain Capital, who has been our majority shareholder since July 2022.

Over five decades, we have grown organically and through acquisitions to become one of the leading providers of IT services, software and digital platforms in Europe, with operations in 29 countries across Europe, Latin America, North America, the Middle East, Asia and Africa. In particular, we have established a leading market position in each of our mature and stable markets, such as France, Iberia and BeLux, which we will continue to capitalize on. We also have a robust presence in growing markets, such as Eastern Europe, Africa and LatAm, which helps us diversify our revenue mix. The global IT services market has grown consistently at or above GDP over the long term and we are currently in a period of acceleration due to the digital and cloud transitions. We believe our geographies and industry verticals are relatively underpenetrated. For example, the IT services expenditure as a percentage of GDP in 2019 was at 1.4% in France and 1.5% in Spain, with these countries still being relatively early in the shift to cloud-based services and solutions. We believe this indicates a forward growth trajectory for these markets as both private and public sector customers continue to increase their IT investments to remain competitive and fill the technology gap that currently exists in comparison with other main EU countries. The French and Spanish IT services markets are expected to resume their growth trajectories at a CAGR of 5.5% and 6.9%, respectively, for the 2021 – 2025 period. See “Industry.” Through our strategic position in these and other key markets, we aim to benefit from the expected structural digital transformation and rise in demand for IT services. We also aim to maintain and consolidate our leadership position in our core activities (such as Application Services and Business Solutions), as well as in our various industry verticals (such as Public Sector and Healthcare and Financial Services), while continuing our service portfolio transformation towards our Business Solutions and Consulting activities.

Our customers increasingly allocate a significant portion of their budgets to cloud-based applications, digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, automation and data analytics, which are key drivers of our digital-led growth. As a result, meeting our customers’ increasing needs in the digital space has become a key focus for us and an area where we intend to generate revenue growth. We have the resources and expertise, including a deep knowledge of legacy IT infrastructures, to accompany our customers in their digital transformation journey. We believe this is particularly valued by customers in our key industry verticals (Financial Services and Public Sector and Healthcare) where a smooth transition is crucial given the mission critical nature of their processes and the high cost of failure due to their highly regulated nature. We also see focused investments in talent and vendor partnerships as an opportunity to accelerate the shift of our revenue mix towards digital services and solutions, with corresponding uplift in organic revenue growth and margin, and believe this is an approach followed successfully by other competitors. We intend to build on our leadership position in our core IT activities to be a leading digital services provider, and we believe our existing customer base and our global delivery model based on proximity to the customer provide a robust base to achieve this. Digital projects we have undertaken for customers include the cloud migration of the technical base of BNP Paribas’s electronic payment system, the redesign and migration of the customer-facing website of BNP Insurance, the migration of corporate customer front-end applications to DevOps and cloud for Orange, the redesign of data warehousing to Google Cloud hosting for Orange, the automation of the process of closing current accounts and passbook accounts for Orange, the cloud migration of databases and management of data APIs for Société Générale and the automation of back-office processes as part of retail bank convergence project within Société Générale.

To pursue additional growth opportunities, we intend to further scale our platform in new geographies and focus on the development of our industry vertical-focused offerings. As one of the largest multi-local players in fragmented IT services markets where scale increasingly matters, we believe that the trend among our customers to consolidate to key partners will benefit large IT service providers (such as ourselves), who can absorb a large portion of IT expenditure from recurring customers. We also seek to capture growth in the upper mid-market segment, leveraging its shift to digital and cloud. This represents a particularly attractive opportunity for us, given our strong presence in the mid-market segment and the fact that there is less competition for such mid-market customers than for larger companies. To adapt our services and solutions to such companies, we intend to continue delivering a comprehensive offering tailored to address these customers’ needs through our broad technical capabilities and local footprint, which we believe gives us a structural advantage against potential competitors by being one of the “one-stop shops” within our industry.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Over the course of over five decades, we have grown both organically and through acquisitions to become one of the leading pan-European providers of IT services and solutions. In 1998, we completed an initial public offering on the French stock exchange. From our founding through the early 2000s, we focused on growing organically, as well as making strategic acquisitions, to build our expertise in IT services and solutions and we also substantially expanded our operations in Southern Europe during this period. In 2008, Apax Partners France and Altamir became shareholders of the Group and, in 2009, Vincent Rouaix became our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, leading us through a period of transformation, during which we recentered our business to focus on the industrialization of our offering, take an industry vertical-based approach and enhance the value-added nature of our services and solutions. Between 2009 and 2011, we implemented a strategic plan to strengthen our business model by focusing on higher value-added activities and updating our delivery models to include onshore, nearshore and offshore offerings. Between 2011 and 2015, following a period of organic growth, we focused on our mergers and acquisitions strategy, which helped accelerate our transformation and concentrate our positions with our major customers in France, as well as internationally. In 2016, Mannai Corporation became our majority shareholder and we delisted our shares from the French stock exchange. In 2016 and 2017, we further expanded our operations in Spain with the acquisition of Efron, a consulting business (2016), in LatAm with the acquisition of Gesfor México, an outsourcing and consulting business (2017), in Portugal with the acquisition of ROFF, an SAP business (2016), in Poland with the acquisition of Impaq, a company providing IT services for blue-chip companies (2016) and in Africa with the acquisition of Value Pass, a Moroccan SAP business (2017), as well as in France with the acquisitions of Metaware, a leading provider of services and solutions for systems modernization, and Novulys, a CRM specialist (2016). Between 2018 and 2020, we reinforced our operations in high-potential geographic areas, with the acquisitions of Realdolmen, a Belgian information and communications technology company (2018) and in new international markets, Bridgeo, a company focused on Sage solutions implementation based in Cameroon and operating in Central Africa (2019) and Capital Consulting and Archos Technology in Morocco (2019). In 2019, we completed six tactical acquisitions, including the acquisitions of SIS, a French company specialized in emergency information systems and alert processing, Hundred, a Peruvian software-publishing group, and I2S, a software publisher specialized in the insurance market in Iberia and Africa, and we reaffirmed our commitment to innovation with the opening of two new FabLabs in Lyon and Madrid. In 2020, we entered a new era in our international development with the acquisition and integration of Informática El Corte Inglés Group (“IECISA”), a Spanish technology consulting company with strong market positions in Spain, Portugal and LatAm, making us a major European technology leader and strengthening our positioning in Iberia and LatAm. In 2021, after ten years of continuous growth, we harmonized our identity at the international level and became Inetum and centered our mission around providing “positive digital flow.” In the same year, we acquired Ilex International, a French identity and access management software developer, Projixi Europe, a French automation, cloud and DevOps company, and HLi Consulting, a CRM dynamics integrator with operations in Morocco and Tunisia.

Each of our activities is described below. Application Services In our Application Services activity, we offer our customers the capabilities and tools to make their organizations “digital,” as well as offering a range of multi-modal IT management services, from advanced application management to testing and IT modernization based on agility and appization, from migration and cloud services to cloud-ready development and DevOps. We develop data-centric strategies for our customers, such as by supporting the deployment of data strategies, data optimization and value-added services and the implementation of new business intelligence and Big Data solutions. Two recent examples of the strength of our Application Services activity are the maintenance and application work we provided to Santander in Spain and Portugal and the OSMOZE digital projects we created for SNCF in France (on which we spent approximately 7,500 person-days on build projects), which focused on e-dispatches and e-contract modernization and information services in DevOps and Agile. We generated €418.4 million of revenue in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 from our Application Services activity, which represented 35.5% of our total revenue for the same period. We estimate that direct margin (which we define as (x) the revenue generated by an activity less the direct costs associated with that activity divided by (y) revenue generated by that activity, expressed as a percentage) from our Application Services activity amounted to approximately 26% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Business Solutions In our Business Solutions activity, we offer customers a customized digital experience with solutions to personalize and configure their offerings, drive omnichannel customer journeys, nurture prospects with digital technology, optimize self-management and increase end-customer loyalty (including customer contact automation, CRM, CMS, portals and customer data platforms), as well as digital employee experience solutions to attract and retain talent by promoting a true digital culture (through, for example, HCM and payroll solutions) and solutions designed to improve their financial and operational performance, including solutions that promote reliable financial information, manage risks and optimize operations with the latest and most innovative SCM, EPM, ECM, ERP, billing and business performance management solutions. As an example of the strength of our Business Solutions activity, we recently implemented ServiceNow, a cloudcomputing platform.

Our Infrastructure Services offering includes cloud management, cybersecurity, application modernization and next-generation advanced IT operations tailored to the customer’s infrastructure, generally without deploying any of our own data centers or infrastructure. We apply smart data, development and automation technologies to our IT operations and provide data exploitation services to customers, such as building and operating Big Data infrastructure and analyzing usage behavior to improve performance and efficiency.

We also serve and target small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as some micro-businesses. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our business benefited from significantly lower customer concentration, with our top 35 customers accounting for 35.3% of our revenue (as compared to 55.6% in 2016) and no customer accounting for more than 2.8% of our revenue. Our top ten customers accounted for 17.5% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. Furthermore, most of the value captured from our top customers is generated across several contracts relating to a variety of our services and solutions, which often have different termination dates, which further protects us from depending on specific customers and contracts. We have created long-term, strategic relationships with our customers and we believe we are often an integral and mission-critical part of their businesses. We benefit from long-lasting customer relationships, with an average contract length of greater than three years for the multi-year contracts in France. More than half of our top ten customers have been with us for more than ten years and almost all of our ten largest accounts from 2012 are still within our top 16 customers today, which demonstrates the strong degree of customer loyalty we enjoy, which is built on our track-record of cost-effective service delivery, customized business solutions, local regulatory and market knowledge, as well as our significant know-how in complex IT architectures. We are consistently recognized as one of the best partners for pricing, relationship and flexibility and our customer satisfaction rate was approximately 90% in France in the year ended December 31, 2021 (according to customer satisfaction surveys that we perform at the end of projects on a continuous basis), which we believe contributes to our increasing contract renewal rates (calculated on the basis of the total value of existing contracts rolled forward in any given year), which in France have been above 90% since 2019 and at 95% in the year ended December 31, 2021, and the longevity of our customer relationships. Customer Contracts We have put in place standard contracts adapted to our various services and solutions offers. Time-based contracts:_ we enter into time and material (“T&M”) variable-cost contracts for short-term (3 to 6 months) projects of a repeatable nature, such as requests for technical assistance or ad hoc consulting. We estimate that we derived approximately 29% of our revenue from T&M contracts for the year ended December 31, 2021. System Integration, Application Management and Other:_ we enter into fixed-price contracts for projects with a defined mandate (such as application management or systems integration) averaging approximately four years. We estimate that we derived approximately 21% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from such contracts. Project Build:_ we enter into fixed-price contracts for one-off projects that may not, due to the nature of the project, result in ongoing maintenance work or generate long-term opportunities. We estimate that we derived approximately 16% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from Project Build contracts. Outsourcing:_ we enter into fixed-price contracts in connection with our Outsourcing activity averaging approximately four years in length. We estimate that we derived approximately 14% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from Outsourcing contracts. ----- Software Solutions contracts:_ we enter into sales contracts for sales of our internally developed Software Solutions, which usually involve a one-time licensing fee or recurring charges under a SaaS delivery model. We estimate that we derived approximately 8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from such contracts. VAR:_ we also enter into contracts for resale of software and hardware entered into in connection with our VAR activity, where we charge a one-time agency fee for the transaction. We estimate that we derived approximately 12% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 from VAR contracts. Contracts valued above a certain threshold (€200,000) are reviewed by our legal department in order to validate and secure our contractual commitments. Additionally, our risk management committee meets regularly to ensure the identification and management of our most sensitive contracts.

A large portion of our customer contracts are long-term in nature, leading to recurring revenue. For example, the length of our project-based contracts across our customer base in France is on average greater than three years. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue, such as certain “time and material” contracts and revenue from our Value-Added Reselling activity, which while not contractually recurring, in our experience are repeatable in nature. We estimate that recurring and highly repeatable revenue accounted for approximately 70% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of January 2022, we estimate that approximately 71% of our 2022 yearly budget was covered through amounts expected to be realized in connection with projects in our weighted pipeline, time and material (“T&M”) contracts for the next three months and oral commitments. This amount increased from approximately 67% in 2021, which we believe reflects our strong demand backlog and gives us a good level of revenue visibility, barring significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop which could impact our weighted pipeline in particular. We also believe our high customer satisfaction, the long-term nature of our customer relationships and the breadth and quality of our services and solutions present important cross-selling opportunities, particularly as we pursue our strategy of growing revenue from digital services and solutions, along with our Business Services and Consulting activities which we view as activities with higher added value and greater revenue growth potential.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The strategy underlying our investment in R&D is based on our ambition to continuously increase our value to our customers and partners, as well as to inspire ideas for change and instill the dynamic of “it’s possible” within our company. We continuously invest in R&D and innovation to support the ongoing improvement of our organization, thereby increasing our competitive capacity and fulfilling the needs of a fluid, rapidly changing market. We invested approximately €50.0 million, €58.0 million and €59.0 million on R&D in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We are currently involved in research projects within the following key areas, spanning our industry verticals: digital industry, smart transportation, digital and physical security, smart city, smart government, energy, waste management, 5G, digital media, cloud, Big Data, blockchain and AI. In general, we seek to focus on areas that are not yet targeted by our competitors, including: - creation of new services and solutions that do not exist in the market, with a high return on investment, and that meet the needs of a world with a constantly changing digital flow; - generation of intellectual property that can be exploited by our activities, which may be software or services, depending on customer needs; - identification of new uses or new services or solutions, as early as possible, to take advantage of unmet customer needs; - creation or modification of the means of production to improve margins; - management and organization of the dissemination of knowledge within our company; and - organization of open innovation in collaboration with customers, prospects and strategic partners, while relying on ecosystems of start-ups and our academic partners. Our innovation program is part of a structured process under the responsibility of our innovation department, which is headed by our chief innovation officer. Our senior management defines the major technological directions in which we invest, as well as the solutions that are expected to bring them to market. These major orientations are materialized in the form of key themes within which each R&D and/or innovation project is embedded. In 2021, we focused our efforts on the following themes: AI to serve our customers’ businesses, AI for operations (AI Ops), AI for development (AI Dev), virtual and augmented reality, the value and intelligence of Big Data, IoT, cybersecurity, blockchain and new tools for modelling and developing new services and solutions. _FabLabs_ Driven by our intention of maximizing the chances for commercialization of our R&D work, we created a unique ecosystem called the FabLab. The main objective of a FabLab is to create an environment dedicated to the exploration of new technologies and the analysis of new challenges, by setting up new venues for concentrating on multidisciplinary projects, welcoming industrial and academic partners and encouraging creativity. The FabLabs aim to host projects from their theoretical formulation to their pre-industrialization phase. During co-creation sessions held with our customers, partners and internal teams, we invent tomorrow’s solutions to address our customers’ business challenges. A FabLab includes: - Research activities, which include scientific publications and research operations with partners; ----- - Solution development activities, which are based on our research to bring original horizontal solutions (e.g., a multi-use technology platform) or vertical solutions (e.g., a service that meets a specific business need) to the market; and - Design thinking, acculturation and prototyping activities, to better understand the needs of our customers and bring them into contact with the innovations we proposed. We have seven FabLabs located in Paris, Nantes, Lyon, Gent, Lisbon, Madrid, Casablanca (and an eighth expected to be opened in Warsaw in 2022). Our network of FabLabs provides us with a unique tool to ensure that our know-how and our ability to offer new services and solutions as close as possible to our customers’ needs is deployed at the local level and is coordinated by our innovation department. _R&D and Innovation Partnerships_ Our innovation strategy is based on various partnerships aimed at investigating key scientific fields for which we do not have the required expertise, as well as developing new uses and new approaches through coinnovation with our partners. These partnerships are also intended to speed up the arrival of innovations on the market. In 2021, we had around ten key R&D and innovation partnerships, including: - Academic Partners: We continued our research activities in partnership with universities such as MINES ParisTech, University of Technology of Troyes, University of Angers, University of Technology of Compiègne and initiated research activities on three new topics with other universities. - Health Sector Research Program: We continued our research program in partnership with the Heart and Vessel Unit of the Cardiac Surgery Department at Bichat Hospital with the aim of improving patient follow-up and the daily life of health care staff by developing an innovative technological solution for the remote monitoring of postoperative patients who have undergone coronary bypass surgery. We also carry out actions in partnership with The FondaMentale Foundation, to strengthen care pathways in the field of mental disorders, and La Prévention Routière aimed at helping reduce road violence. _Services and Solutions Resulting from Our R&D and Innovation Work_ Several of our research projects have resulted in technologies that we use in our IT services, software and digital platforms, thereby transforming and improving our offering to our customers. For example, BotFoundry (a chatbot factory), Metachatbot, Firmin Business (integration of the Pepper robot into organizations’ reception processes), Vision Learn (real-time image detection and analysis application) and AI OPS are some of our most notable achievements. We believe that our strong focus on R&D and innovation, as well as the significant amount of resources deployed to train our technology engineers, core process specialists and digital scientist, coupled with our strategic acquisitions, will help us face the risks surrounding talent shortages in the IT industry in the IT industry, which is a key challenge in the IT sector.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

We have implemented processes to this effect and systematically evaluate the environmental impact of our activities, including through our efforts to use a responsible supply chain. To this end, we have partnered with EcoVadis and we have launched a responsible purchasing program and work to detect and ----- minimize the risk of serious diolations of human rights, fundamental freedoms and to protect health, personal safety and the environment. Through our partnership with EcoVadis, we expect that our corporate and social responsibility assessment will be integrated into our selection process for our strategic suppliers and that the annual purchasing costs stemming from IT suppliers audited by EcoVadis as a percentage of total purchasing costs stemming from IT suppliers (excluding sub-contractors), will increase in France, Spain, Portugal and Belgium (with a target of 50% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and rising incrementally every year to a target of 80% for the year ended December 31, 2028). Although we consider our activities to have a low pollution risk, we have implemented an ISO 14001:2015-certified environmental management system, a certification which covers our Romanian subsidiary and Spanish subsidiaries in Madrid and Bilbao. This management system allows us to systematically evaluate the environmental impact of our activities, monitor performance and improve processes linked to the relevant environmental factors (electricity consumption, fuel and electronic waste and risks related to land spills). We also comply with applicable legislation with respect to the control of emissions into the atmosphere, soil and water. We deploy resources that we consider sufficient for the implementation of our environmental policies and objectives. In order to limit our carbon foot print and greenhouse gas emissions, we have adopted a policy that encourages employees to (i) use low-carbon transport and (ii) use digital communication systems to limit travel to the minimum necessary, thereby ensuring a decline in CO2 and other polluting emissions caused by our employees. The total grams of carbon dioxide per employee emitted by our company due to business travel and energy consumption decreased by approximately 51% between 2019 and 2021(driven by remote working, green energy and green mobility efforts), with a modest increase expected in 2022 and a further 20% decrease targeted over the next 6 years. As of June 30, 2022, electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles represented 10% and 50% of our fleet, respectively. Our ambition is to replace 20% of our car fleet with electric or hybrid or rechargeable hybrid vehicles with low CO2 emissions by the end of 2022. We also limit our offices’ energy consumption by extending on-site selective sorting, increasing waste recovery, managing waste electrical and electronic equipment and maximizing the life cycle of resources to prevent pollution. Since March 2021, the electricity purchased from EDF at the French sites has been 100% renewable. We also facilitate remote working by providing our employees with key remote working tools and equipment, which has greatly reduced the number of employees commuting to work as well as paper consumption. We also comply with applicable regulations concerning the responsible use of energy and the sustainable use of transportation. In addition, we have launched our Green Project, which focuses on the development of practices and solutions that have a positive impact on our planet and its occupants. It consists of three parts: (i) our green IT practices and solutions, (ii) our IT for green offers and (iii) the implementation of an internal approach to digital sobriety including regular awareness-raising among our employees. Through our Green Project, we are developing a solution for an energy supplier in Africa to replace generators with solar micro power plants (solutions to manage electricity supply in urban and rural economic clusters by installing clean energy micro power plants). In parallel, we are working on the implementation of a meter-to-cash solution for the monetization of energy services (prepaid offers).

The Senior Facilities will also be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for 79.4% of the Group’s revenue, 79.3% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and 83.9% of the Group’s total assets as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of any applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may effectively have no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—The Note Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “—Your rights as a creditor may not be as favorable under the insolvency laws of France, Spain and Belgium as compared to the insolvency laws of the United States or other jurisdictions and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each_ Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ The Issuer is a holding company and will be dependent upon the cash flow from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, interest payments on intercompany loans or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financing Arrangements _and the Notes—The Issuer is a holding company with no operations of its own.”_ A significant portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of nonGuarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financing _Arrangements and the Notes—Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of those subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.” Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock and_ Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note ----- Guarantees).

Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after ----- the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the relevant Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, ----- delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a transfer after the Offering) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8) (save that in respect of clause (5), this proviso shall not apply in connection with transfer, personal property or similar Taxes). The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.23,Change of Control,21.23.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a Change of Control Offer or (ii) the Issuer previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this heading “—Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of the relevant clearing system or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the relevant clearing system, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and trigger the Change of Control Offer requirements under other financing arrangements of a Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. ----- Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional _Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable_ redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Status or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below) from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero. During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens”covenant and the “Permitted Liens”and “Permitted Collateral Liens” definitions and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness;” (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;” (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions _from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be_ permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on _Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;” (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to_ comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted _Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such_ Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred ----- during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

If the Issuer elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction. If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that (a) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause (a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto. If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations. If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing). Subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness,” in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction. If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratiobased basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric, such ----- ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility, working capital facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn or is for working capital purposes (including under any Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (viii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness,” any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric. For purposes of determining compliance with (A) any euro-denominated Applicable Metric, the Euro Equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange transaction entered into by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction or any rate referred to in clause (B) below); or (B) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Note Documents), the euro-equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, at the Issuer’s option, using any of (i) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the relevant Testing Period; (ii) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements or management accounts; or (iii) any applicable spot conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test Date, if applicable); (iv) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging arrangement entered into by any member of the Group or (v) any applicable spot conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) applicable on the Issue Date and/or the Acquisition Closing Date, and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the euro equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Without prejudice to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Issuer may, from time to time, by notice to the Trustee, redenominate any Applicable Metric denominated in a particular currency into euro (as it may elect) by reference to any rate referred to in clause (B) of the immediately preceding paragraph and, on and from the date of such notice, such Applicable Metric shall for all purposes be construed as being denominated in such currency specified by the Issuer in the amount determined by the Issuer in accordance with this paragraph. Consolidated EBITDA or, as the case may be, Consolidated Net Income for any part of the applicable Relevant Period falling prior to the date on which the Inetum Group became part of the Group shall be calculated on the basis that the definition of Consolidated EBITDA or, as the case may be, Consolidated Net Income is to be construed as if references to the Group were references to the Inetum Group and the calculation shall be based on actual historic data for the corresponding period available as adjusted in accordance with other provisions of the Indenture. In the event that: (i) any end of a fiscal year or end date of a quarter is adjusted by the Issuer to avoid any such date falling on a day which is not a Business Day and/or to ensure that such date falls on a particular day of the week; or (ii) there is any adjustment to a scheduled payment date to avoid payments becoming due on a day which is not a Business Day, if that adjustment results in any amount being paid in a Relevant Period in which it would otherwise not have been paid, for the purpose of calculating any financial definition or ratio or Applicable Metric under the Indenture, the Issuer may (at its election) treat such amount as if it was paid in the Relevant Period in which it would have been paid save for any such adjustment. Unless a contrary indication appears, a reference to Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income is to be construed as a reference to the Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income of the Group on a consolidated basis. Subject to clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness”, in the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the baskets or exceptions set out in the Indenture, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify and may from time to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount or transaction may at the option of the Issuer be split between different baskets or exceptions). If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially simultaneously (i)(A) any Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed currency amount or a percentage of ----- LTM EBITDA (a “fixed permission”) are intended to be utilized; and/or (B) revolving Indebtedness is intended to be Incurred; and (ii) any Applicable Metric required to be determined by reference to any ratio-based Applicable Metric (a “ratio-based permission”) are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination of any increase or decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with clauses (i)(C), (i)(D), (i)(E), (v)(B)(1)(I), (v)(B)(1)(II) or (v)(B)(1)(III) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness”) then (x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be calculated without giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, or amounts previously incurred under such fixed permissions and not reclassified that are being repaid in connection with such Applicable Transaction, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; and (y) thereafter, compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and in each case, full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or discharges of Indebtedness in connection with such Applicable Transaction in accordance with the Indenture. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in this “Description of the Notes”), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof, the Issuer shall be permitted to (A) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from (i) the Transactions, (ii) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting, (iii) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing businesses, (iv) Restructuring Costs; (v) research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof); and/or (vi) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under the Accounting Principles) or any other changes in the applicable Accounting Principles; and/or (B) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated Synergies (as defined below)) or costs or expenses (i) of a type reflected in this Offering Memorandum and/or any base case model or quality of earnings report relating to an Investment or acquisition permitted under the Indenture prepared by an independent third party and/or (ii) taken into account in determining (x) consolidated EBITDA or (y) the financing EBITDA to be used in connection with financing for an Investment or acquisition permitted under the Indenture. In calculating any Applicable Metric or financial ratio, no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting of that item. When calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or any component thereof, the Issuer shall (in its sole discretion) be permitted to either apply or disregard the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases) _provided that in respect of any items that are included or excluded on such basis, such treatment is used_ consistently in each calculation, including in respect of Indebtedness, Total Debt, Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated EBITDA in any single such calculation (provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Capitalized Lease Obligations (or other amounts constituting a liability under IFRS 16 (Leases)) shall be included in any measure of Indebtedness that is secured under the Intercreditor Agreement). Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”): (i) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in any preceding Annual Period ending since the Issue Date and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (and where such permitted amount is determined by reference to a grower permission (as defined above), such amount shall be calculated using LTM EBITDA) (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (and where such permitted amount is determined by reference to a grower permission (as defined above), such amount shall be calculated using LTM EBITDA) (the “Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such ----- Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount (with such amounts being used in chronological order for each relevant Annual Period); (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015 and applies to insolvencies which commenced after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions), the EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark and other than in respect of certain insurance, credit institution and investment undertakings) to public collective insolvency proceedings listed in its Annex A, the courts of the EU Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests (“COMI”) of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another EU Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the debtor’s central administration is located in an EU Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the EU Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency ----- Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one EU Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another EU Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence “territorial proceedings”(before the opening of the main insolvency proceedings) or “secondary proceedings” (after the opening of the main insolvency proceedings) against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Where main proceedings have been commenced in the EU Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another EU Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. Where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another EU Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the EU Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that EU Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the EU Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the EU Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the EU Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a EU Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another EU Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other EU Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a EU Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that ----- other EU Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other EU Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the debtor has assets. In the event that the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations assumed by and of the security interests in the Collateral granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the EU Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other EU Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other EU Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the debtor or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: - for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii) insolvency practitioners and courts; - for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; - that the EU Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and - that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 at 11.00 p.m. (the “Exit Day”) and therefore is no longer a EU Member State. The European Union Withdrawal Agreement (“EUWA”), as amended by the European Union Withdrawal Agreement Act 2020, provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect in EU law immediately before Exit Day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly applicable EU law (which includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into UK domestic law. However, while direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) set out a number of amendments to be made to the Insolvency Regulation, as it will apply in the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period. ----- On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement entered into force effectively on May 1, 2021. At this stage, there remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and the extent to which Brexit could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. Further, the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU Member States and to effectively deal with assets located in EU Member States. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in such EU Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU Member State.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by EU Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the EU Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a Cross-Class Cram-Down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by EU Member States by 17 July 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on 17 July 2024 or, in others, on 17 July 2026), subject to a maximum one year extension of the transposition period for EU Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. French statute No. 2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 (“Loi Pacte”) grants the French government twenty-four months to enact appropriate measures through ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive. ----- Ordinance No. 2021-1193 dated September 15, 2021 and its implementation decree No. 2021-1218 dated 23 September 2021 amending Book VI of the French Commercial Code transposed the EU Restructuring Directive into French law. The new French law contained in Ordinance No. 2021-1193 published in the Official Journal (Journal Officiel) on September 16, 2021 applies to proceedings commenced from October 1[st], 2021, subject to some exceptions (“Transposition Ordinance”). The draft law ratifying, amending and supplementing Ordinance No. 2021-1193, amending Book VI of the French Commercial Code, is currently examined by the French Parliament since January 5, 2022. In the frame of this ratification, the French legislator may modify the letter of Ordinance No. 2021-1193, which may therefore not be final. Its main features are: - the introduction of a new and unique version of the accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde _accélérée);_ - the replacement of the existing “creditor-committees” system by a class-based system for adopting safeguard or reorganization plan, and the possibility to cram down dissenting classes including equity holders subject to certain conditions (“Cross-Class Cram-Down”); - the strengthening of the distinction between regular safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde) and judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire); - the permanent establishment of “Post Money Lien” originally introduced as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect new funding provided to a debtor in connection with safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings; and - a series of other, more minor reforms such as the strengthening of early warning systems and the confidential conciliation procedure; and the clarification of the interaction between certain types of security and insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

In addition, to the extent that (i) their COMI is deemed to be in France or they have an establishment in France or, (ii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their registered office or their centre of main interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., either safeguard proceedings or accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde or sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire). Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard (which does no longer exist and was replaced by one single proceeding namely accelerated safeguard proceedings by Ordinance No. 2021-1193 dated September 15, 2021), judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The Transposition Ordinance and its implementation decree No. 2021-1218 provides for significant changes of French insolvency law (especially with regards to the structure and approval process of restructuring plans).

In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see_ “—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of ----- the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the president of the court (usually the commercial court) who appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by a debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of_ a legal, economic or financial nature but (at the time the conciliation proceedings are commenced) is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. Conciliation proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliateur, the president of the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: (i) those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration and (ii) creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or _liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings._ Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period (due debt rescheduling for a maximum of two years) in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace periods”above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliateur, a request made by the conciliateur to defer payment of the creditors’ claim. Moreover, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliateur, a request made by the _conciliateur to defer payment of its unmatured claim, the judge may defer or reschedule the payment of this_ unmatured claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings (i.e., a maximum period of five months). The judge will take his/her decision after having heard the conciliateur and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. The conciliation agreement reached between the debtor and its creditors and/or trade partners and/or other stakeholders may be either acknowledged (constaté) by the President of the Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the _conciliation proceedings remain confidential._ Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose, to which the social and economic committee, as the case may be, must be convened, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will ----- survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition: - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the social and economic committee that is informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court; - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and postcommencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including certain pre-commencement or postcommencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted nor written off, not even by the classes of affected parties; - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency test” above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (période suspecte) (as defined below—see “—The hardening period (période suspecte) in judicial _reorganization and liquidation proceedings”) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings, cannot_ be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its performance and while it is in force: - interest accruing on the affected claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; - pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the right, during the performance period of a conciliation agreement, to petition the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being made after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and - pursuant to Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor and a third party having previously granted credit support (a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or security interest (sûreté réelle)) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings and during the performance of the conciliation agreement. In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Nevertheless, the termination of the conciliation agreement does not invalidate the provisions the purpose of which is to organize the consequences arising out of the termination of the conciliation agreement. ----- _Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a_ majority of creditors large enough to render likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’consent in safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings, as described below. At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the matter, mandat _ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in_ particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business” (Prepack sale—plan de cession) which would be implemented, as applicable, in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the _mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard,_ judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor. As a matter of law, two types of contractual provisions are deemed null and void: (i) any provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end and (ii) any provision forcing the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of _conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers whom the creditors_ have retained in connection with these proceedings. A statement of all the costs incurred by the debtor is prepared by him, with the conciliateur’s help and includes: - the remuneration of the conciliateur, if it has already been agreed, or, if not, the conditions of this remuneration as fixed by the president of the court, as well as the remuneration of the mandataire ad hoc if a mandat ad hoc has immediately preceded the commencement of the conciliation proceedings; - the remuneration of any person or expert appointed by the judge or involvement of whom has been requested by the conciliateur; - the fees of the debtor’s advisors or those paid by the debtor in the framework of the conciliation proceedings and the mandat ad hoc proceedings which may have immediately preceded it; and - the fees of the creditor’s advisors when they are charged to the debtor. This statement shall be signed and submitted to the court’s clerk by the debtor. Before acknowledging or approving the conciliation agreement, the president of the court or the court checks the filing of this statement with the court clerk. This cost statement may only be disclosed to the conciliateur, the president of the court, the court or the State prosecutor. In the event of the opening of subsequent insolvency proceedings, the court may, ex officio or at the request of the State prosecutor, be provided with the statement. Where the debtor cannot manage to reach an agreement with its creditors within the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings, the court will terminate those proceedings. The termination of amicable proceedings does not, in and of itself, entail specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced during a three-month period following the termination of the previous one.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Where it is not demonstrated that the debtor is experiencing difficulties that it is not able to overcome,_ the court may invite the debtor to request the opening of conciliation proceedings. Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not_ necessary) within the list of judicial administrators (whose name can be proposed by the debtor or the State prosecutor). At the request of the debtor or the State prosecutor, or by the court on its own, two or more administrators can be appointed. The appointment of several administrators becomes mandatory when the debtor (i) owns at least three establishments outside the jurisdiction of the court where it is registered, or (ii) holds or controls (as provided by Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) at least ----- two companies subject to court-administered proceedings, or (iii) is held or controlled (as provided by the same articles) by a company subject to court-administered proceedings, such company itself holding or controlling another company subject to such proceedings, and (iv) generates at least €20 million of net turnover (for (ii) and (iii)). In case mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings were commenced in the eighteen months preceding the commencement of court-administered proceedings, the State prosecutor can object to the appointment of the mandataire ad hoc or conciliateur as administrator. The administrator is appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to twelve months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de _sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or_ Equity Holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor, assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will either, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex-post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Disposal decisions that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, among others require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). The supervisory judge can appoint one to five controllers (contrôleurs) among the creditors who have filed a request, provided they meet certain conditions (in particular no affiliation to the debtor). Controllers (contrôleurs) assist the creditors’ representative in his functions and the supervisory judge in his duty of supervising the progress of the insolvency proceedings. In order to protect creditors’ interests and under certain conditions, the controllers may act in the interests of the creditors when the creditors’ representative fails to take sufficient action. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_ representative or the State prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: - the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the State prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (i) (b) above, where: - the court may not act on its own initiative, and - the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’representative or the State prosecutor may only act in the event that no plan has been adopted by the classes of affected parties (as described below); - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the supervisory judge as controllers (“Contrôleurs”) (if any), the State prosecutor and the social and economic committee (if any). In case of the situation described in (i)(b) above, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request of the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan was approved by the relevant classes of Affected Parties or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances. In case of conversion of the proceedings, classes of Affected Parties (as defined below) that have already been formed prior to the conversion would remain with the same allocation and computation of the votes, subject to pending challenges. Ongoing process of constitution of classes shall continue notwithstanding such conversion. As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. ----- The Transposition Ordinance created a new post money privilege as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings (the “Post Money Lien”). The Post Money Lien applies exclusively to proceedings commenced from October 1, 2021. The Post Money Lien also applies in the event of an amendment to the safeguard plan or reorganization plan adopted in proceedings commenced before May 22, 2020. The Post Money Lien is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted, with the approval of the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire), after commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period: - The Post Money Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person: - in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business during the observation period, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the supervisory judge, or - for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as approved or amended by the court, and for the purposes of its performance, it being specified that both the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote and the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts. - Claims benefiting from the Post Money Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including certain pre-commencement or postcommencement employment claims, procedural costs and claims benefiting of the New Money Lien as defined above) in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. - Such claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings. Once safeguard proceedings have been commenced, there will be an automatic stay on certain claims. Payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and if they do not relate to expenses necessary for the debtor’s business activities during the observation period, are not for the requirements of the proceedings, or not in consideration for services rendered or goods delivered to the debtor during this period is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the supervisory judge can authorize payments for pre-commencement debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed to continue the debtor’s operation or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) (see “—Status of creditors during _safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings”)._ The supervisory judge may also authorize the payment to a carrier exercising an action against ultimate client or a compromise or settlement agreement with a carrier, or the granting of any contractual security interest to guarantee a post-commencement claim. During the safeguard proceedings, any increase in the perimeter of a contractual security interest or a contractual right of retention, regardless of the method used, is prohibited. Consequently, margin call provisions are neutralized. This prohibition does not apply to any assignment of receivables as set forth in Articles 313-23 and seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code if the framework master agreement was entered into before the commencement of the proceedings. Creditors (and, if applicable, Equity Holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation vary according to the size of the business. _Standard consultation:_ For debtors which have (i) less than 250 employees and less than a net turnover of €20 million or (ii) less than a net turnover of €40 million. This also applies in respect of debtors which own or control other entities within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, who fall below these thresholds. If so requested by the debtors and with the consent of the supervisory judge, creditors may also be subject to the class-based consultation. In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. ----- French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative prohibition, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of the claim over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of the claim over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved do not need to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the Post Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and from the sixth year onwards, at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual applicable legal provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period (which cannot exceed the duration of the plan) during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps. _Class-based consultation:_ This applies to (i) large companies with (x) at least 250 employees and a net turnover of €20 million or (y) with a net turnover of at least €40 million, and to (ii) companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds. This consultation could also apply or upon the debtor’s request and with the consent of the supervisory judge in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds. ----- Are considered as “affected parties” (i) any creditors the rights of which are directly affected by the restructuring plan, (ii) or any stakeholders which hold an instrument giving access either immediately or on a deferred basis to the debtor’s share capital in the event of their stake in the debtor’s capital, the debtor’s articles of association, or such stakeholder’s rights are modified by the draft plan (the “Equity Holders”). Only the affected parties can vote on the draft plan. The affected parties shall inform the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire), within 10 days from the notice sent by the court-appointed administrator, of any intercreditor agreements entered into before the commencement of the proceedings. Failing this, these intercreditor agreements are unenforceable. The composition of the classes of affected parties are determined in light of the claims and rights arising prior to the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings. The court-appointed administrator divides the affected parties into classes, which reflect sufficient commonality of interest, based on verifiable criteria, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: - creditors holding security interests over the debtor’s assets, for their secured claims, and unsecured creditors are members of separate classes; - composition of classes respects intercreditor agreements concluded before the commencement of the proceedings, provided that the affected parties have notified the existence of such subordination agreements to the court-appointed administrator within 10 days of the receipt of the notice sent by the court-appointed administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the affected parties to notify the existence of such subordination agreements. Otherwise, the intercreditor agreements are unenforceable in the context of the proceedings; - Equity Holders are members of separate classes. Claims arising under employment contracts, pension rights acquired under an occupational pension scheme and maintenance claims arising from a family relationship are excluded from the class-based consultation and therefore are not affected by the plan. At least 21 days before the date of the vote, the court-appointed administrator must submit to each affected party the rules governing the class formation criteria and the voting rights with respect to the class(es) to which affected parties belong. The amount of the claims taken into account shall be the amount indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor(s) or, where no statutory auditor has been appointed, established by its chartered accountant. In the case of affected parties which are beneficiaries of a trust (fiducie) set up as a guarantee by the debtor, only the amounts of their claims not guaranteed by such a security shall be taken into account. Where there is an indexation clause, the amount of interest remaining due on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings is calculated at the rate applicable on the date of that judgment. Foreign currency receivables are converted into euros at the exchange rate on the date of the judgment. In the event of disagreement, each affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors’ representative or the court-appointed administrator can challenge the rules governing the class formation criteria or the voting rights before the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire), within 10 days from the notification or publication of such rules. The supervisory judge must rule on such challenge within 10 days. In the absence of a decision by the supervisory judge in the 10 days period, the matter may be referred to the court. Appeal against the supervisory judge’s decision has to be filed within 5 days of his/her order. The court of appeal then has 15 days to rule. There is no possibility to submit a challenge before the French Supreme Court. The debtor, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, is in charge of preparing the draft plan. The draft plan shall be sent to the classes for a vote. The draft plan may, in particular, provide for rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity swaps. The classes of affected parties must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each class of affected parties (two-thirds of the votes held by the members casting a vote). The class or classes of Equity Holders vote in accordance with the provisions applicable to either extraordinary general meetings, shareholders’meetings and special meetings or bondholders’general meetings, as the case may be. Within a class, the vote on the adoption of the plan may be replaced by an agreement which, after consultation with its members, has received the approval of two-thirds of the voting rights. ----- When the classes have adopted the draft plan, the court rules upon it and verifies that the following conditions are met: - the plan has been adopted in accordance with the rules regarding the affected parties and their classification into classes; - the affected parties sharing a sufficient community of interest within the same class benefit from equal treatment and are treated in proportion to their claim or right; - all affected parties have been duly notified of the plan; - if some affected parties have voted against the draft plan, none of these affected parties is worse off under a restructuring plan than such a creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities under were applied, either in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the restructuring plan were not confirmed (the “Best Interest",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.3,of Creditors Test”). If a party voting against a draft plan argues the judgment does not satisfy the Best,1852.3.1,Court-administered proceedings—accelerated safeguard,"A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée). The accelerated safeguard proceedings are designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by any debtor under the Transposition Ordinance. If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require the classes of affected parties to be constituted, the court opening accelerated safeguard proceedings must order such formation. In that regard, the court shall authorize such constitution for the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings. To be eligible for accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable); ----- - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough affected parties involved in the proceedings to render its adoption by the relevant classes of affected parties likely within a maximum of two months, extendable for two months, following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings; - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings; and - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome. When the debtor’s accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan will be adopted only by creditors having the status of finance companies, credit institutions and equivalent, as well as by all holders of a claim acquired from them or from a supplier of goods or services and, where applicable, bondholders, the debtor may request the commencement of safeguard proceedings, the effects of which are limited to these creditors. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard proceedings apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. The other creditors’ debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings in relation to the constitution of classes of affected parties is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (for example, affected parties will be consulted by way of a class-based consultation on a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de _sauvegarde accélérée) and affected parties may not prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see_ “—Class-based consultation”)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is four months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial two-month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings when classes of affected parties are set up and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the classes of affected parties. If a plan is not adopted by the affected parties and approved by the court within the applicable deadlines, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The list of claims of affected parties to the conciliation proceedings established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered-accountant shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings, unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of creditors during safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial _liquidation proceedings” below)._",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.3,of Creditors Test”). If a party voting against a draft plan argues the judgment does not satisfy the Best,1852.3.2,Court-administered proceedings—judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings,"Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may be initiated against (i.e., by a creditor or the State prosecutor) or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, with respect to liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings. If it does not, de _jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil liability._ Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may ----- propose to the debtor the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire), a controller, the State prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert reorganization_ proceedings into liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the controllers, the State prosecutor and the social and economic committee (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a safeguard plan) or, unlike safeguard proceedings, if it appears that a reorganization plan is not possible, the sale of the business (which will occur through an open bid process organized by the administrator) or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings, subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are similar, subject to certain exceptions including: - if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); - any affected party may also prepare a reorganization draft plan which shall be submitted, together with the plan drafted by the debtor, to a vote of the classes of affected parties at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; - if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void; - if the classes of affected parties do not approve the reorganization plan, it may be approved (arrêté) by the court at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator (with the debtor’s consent) or any affected party and be imposed on the classes that voted against the draft plan (Cross-Class Cram-Down), where the plan meets the conditions of the Cross-Class Cram-Down mechanism; and - if the reorganization plan is not adopted by the classes of affected parties or according to the Cross-Class Cram-Down mechanism, the ability to impose an alternative plan according to the classic individual consultation and impose payment terms by the court is possible. At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In addition, the Transposition Ordinance modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new Post Money Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—Court-administered proceedings—safeguard”). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in the framework of individual standard consultation, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator ----- on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and allows the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholders’ meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be simultaneously purchased by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’priority order of payment). Managers are no longer in possession. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation scenario, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the_ business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business; As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets/jobs/contracts) without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their in _bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the_ business as a going concern, and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: ----- - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; - the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets for example) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless reaching an agreement with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their in bonis market value; - separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the insolvency judge may decide to: - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or - request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

Also, except in the case of fraud, the date of insolvency may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the date of insolvency of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void by the court or voidable by the court. - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered ----- by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, contractual security interest or contractual rights of retention constituted on the debtor’s assets or rights guaranteeing debts having previously incurred (unless they replace a security interest having at least the same nature and perimeter and with the exception of the assignment of a claim provided for in Articles L. 313-23 and seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code, made in performance of a framework agreement concluded prior to the date of cessation of payments), for debts having previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures _conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to_ stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers _détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if_ the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.” There is no hardening period prior to successful safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

If a party voting against a draft plan argues the judgment does not satisfy the Best,1852.3.4,"Status of creditors during safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings","Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings”(in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation) dated January 14, 2014, No. 12-22.909 regarding a judicial reorganization proceedings and in_ accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated February 22, No 15-15.942 regarding a safeguard proceedings, which case law is likely to be extended to accelerated safeguard proceedings). The court-appointed administrator can, conversely, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business”(plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business or to pay a carrier requesting payment directly from the debtor); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor, security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge; ----- - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien or a Post Money Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors (or beneficiaries of a security interest over tangible asset granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor; or - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable—is located in another EU Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (provided no secondary proceedings are commenced in such EU Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party). - any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code; and - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan de sauvegarde”) or a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”). In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims and securities arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a proof of claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin officiel des annonces _civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan_ France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims or securities have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. ----- In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, however the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (failing which, its chartered certified accountant). Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor whether partial (within the frame of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings) or total (within the frame of reorganization or liquidation proceedings), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditor’s representative) in charge of selling the assets of the debtor and settling its debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court official fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a Post Money Lien, post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. If a third party (such as a creditor) has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company (“dirigeant de fait”). In such case, article L 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, such third party being deemed de facto manager may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that its mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the concerned managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount. However, de jure or de facto managers cannot be held liable on the grounds of article L 651-2 of the French Commercial Code in the event of simple negligence on their part.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it ----- should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form of a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de _nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each_ statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor, as defined below. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

If a party voting against a draft plan argues the judgment does not satisfy the Best,1852.3.7,Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (soulte),"Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either: (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or judicially-appointed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. In addition, in view of the area of activity of French entities of the Group, it should be noted that foreign investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors (notably where their activities relate to equipment, products or services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national security, in particular in the areas of energy and water supply, public health, public transport and electronic communication) may require the prior authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business. Where any of the sectors specified by law or regulations are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure: - a transaction as a result of which a non-EU/EEA investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business (branche d’activité) or (iii) crosses the threshold of 25 percent of the voting rights, in each case of an entity whose registered office is located in France; - a transaction as a result of which an EU/EEA investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business, in either case of an entity whose registered office is located in France. When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French authorities which must render a decision within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete application (failing which authorization shall be deemed not to have been granted). The decision ----- can grant or not the authorization or condition its obtainment to further examination (examen _complémentaire) by the French authorities._ In the event of further examination (examen complémentaire) the French authorities must render a decision within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the decision conditioning the obtainment of the authorization to further examination (examen complémentaire) (failing which authorization shall be deemed not to have been granted). The approval of the French authorities would be required in order to allow the Security Agent to enforce the pledge over the shares of the Group and/or certain of its subsidiaries. We can provide no assurance that such approval would be granted. In addition to these limitations, specific insolvency-related limitations may prevent the enforcement of security interests in the context of court-assisted or court-administered proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against all the creditors of the relevant debtor (if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) or the concerned creditor (if the claim was lodged by such creditor) if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of a claim lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the ----- court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan)) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre _gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes,_ the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a Note Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Note Guarantee could be (i) declared unenforceable against all the creditors if the claim was lodged by the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire) or the court-appointed commissioner in charge of overseeing the implementation of the safeguard_ or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or (ii) declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. French case law has recognized that certain intragroup transactions (including upstream guarantees), can be in the corporate interest of the guarantor, in particular where the four following criteria are fulfilled: - the existence of a genuine group of companies operating under a common strategy working towards a common objective and the guarantee and the transaction to which it relates must be entered into in the common economic intent of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate of such group benefit; - the risk assumed by a French guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit; - the French guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee which is commensurate to such group benefit; and - the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial capability. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Each of the Note Guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its Note Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. Accordingly, the Note Guarantee of any French Guarantor will be limited to the aggregate amount of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or pursuant to any other intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Note Guarantee. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will reduce the maximum amount of its Note Guarantee. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Note Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantees. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

If a party voting against a draft plan argues the judgment does not satisfy the Best,1852.3.16,,"Interest of Creditors Test, the court will determine the value of the company on a going concern basis; - where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively affect the interests of the affected parties. The court may refuse to approve the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The court must check that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected.” The judgement adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the plan is not approved by the required majority of each class of affected parties, it may be approved (arrêté) by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator with the agreement of the debtor and be imposed on the parties that voted against the draft plan (Cross-Class Cram-Down), where the plan meets the following conditions: - the plan complies with the conditions for the adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; - the plan has been approved by: - a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, including at least one class of secured creditors or a class ranking higher than the class of unsecured creditors; or, if such condition is not met, - by at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than a class of Equity Holders or any other class which, after determination of the value of the debtor as a going concern, it may reasonably be assumed it would not be entitled to any payment, if the order of priority of creditors for the distribution of the assets in liquidation proceedings or of the sale plan (plan de cession) were applied; - the claims of a dissenting class of affected creditors shall be paid in full (by identical or equivalent means) if a more junior class receives any distribution or keeps any interest under the restructuring plan (the “absolute priority rule”) (the court may decide to waive this condition under certain conditions); - under the safeguard plan, no class of affected parties may receive or retain more than the total amount of its claims or interests; - in the case of one or more dissenting classes of Equity Holders: - the formation of classes of affected parties was compulsory regarding the thresholds met by the debtor (i.e., 250 employees and a net turnover of €20 million or with a net turnover of at least €40 million at the group level); - it may reasonably be assumed, after determination of the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the dissenting classes of Equity Holders would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if the order of priority of creditors for the distribution of the assets in liquidation proceedings or of the sale plan (plan de cession) were applied; - if the draft plan provides for a share capital increase subscribed in cash or by way of set off, the shares to be issued are offered in preference to the existing shareholders, in proportion to the part of the share capital represented by their shares; ----- - the plan does not provide for the sale of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of Equity Holders. The decision of the court shall constitute approval of the changes to the shareholding structure or to the rights of the Equity Holders or to the articles of association provided for in the plan. The court may appoint an agent to carry out the acts necessary for the implementation of these amendments. As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set up a time-period (which cannot exceed the duration of the plan) during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that: - the best interest test criterion has not been met; or - the condition relating to the adoption of the draft plan by at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote (other than a class of Equity Holders or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, it is reasonable to assume would not be entitled to any payment if the order of payment in a judicial liquidation was applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, a courtordered sale plan)) has not been met; or - in the event of a cross class-cram-down on Equity Holders, the condition relating to the debtor’s value criterion has not been met (i.e., it is reasonable to assume, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the Equity Holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation was applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, of a court-ordered sale plan)), may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. The decision made by the court regarding the adoption of the plan may be appealed under the ordinary procedure within 10 days from its notification (or of its communication if the appeal was lodged by the State prosecutor). The decision of the court of appeal may be challenged before the French Supreme Court. In case of failure to adopt the plan in safeguard proceedings, the alternatives are either the termination of these proceedings or the conversion into judicial reorganization proceedings. The imposition of an alternative plan and payment terms is not possible. _Specific case—creditors that are public institutions:_ Public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted for default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The Spanish Insolvency Law will enter into force 20 calendar days after its publication in the Official Gazzette (Boletín Oficial del Estado) on September 6, 2022 and will apply to insolvency proceedings commenced after its entry into force. Insolvency proceedings already commenced before such date will still be governed by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 of 5 May, with a number of certain exceptions set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law. The Spanish Insolvency Law seeks to overcome some limitations of the existing Spanish pre-insolvency and insolvency system, such as (i) the limited use of pre-insolvency proceedings in comparison with other European countries, (ii) the excessive duration of insolvency proceedings due to the high work-load of Spanish commercial courts and (iii) the tendency of Spanish companies to only file for insolvency when their financial situation is critical and therefore the high number of insolvency proceedings ending up in liquidation. In addition, due to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 14, 2020, the Spanish government declared a state of emergency (estado de alarma) in Spain lasting until June 21, 2020. Since March 14, 2020, the Spanish government has enacted certain Royal Decree-Laws that temporarily amend certain provisions of the Spanish insolvency regime, as described below. Likewise, future changes to, and amendments or restatements of the Spanish Insolvency Law cannot be ruled out either. The Spanish government has also approved several extraordinary resolutions, including Royal Decree Law 34/2020, of November 17, on urgent measures to support business solvency and the energy sector, and on tax-related measures (Real Decreto-ley 34/2020, de 17 de noviembre, de medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia _empresarial y al sector energético, y en materia tributaria) and Act 3/2020, of September 18, adopting_ procedural and organizational measures to confront COVID-19 in the area of the administration of justice (Ley 3/2020, de 18 de septiembre, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el _ámbito de la Administración de Justicia) (“Act 3/2020”) as amended under Royal Decree-Law 5/2021 of_ March 12 on urgent measures to support business solvency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Real _Decreto-ley 5/2021, de 12 de marzo, de medidas extraordinarias de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial en respuesta a la pandemia de la COVID-19) and Royal Decree-Law 27/2021, under which it extends certain financial_ measures to support the recovery of businesses (Real Decreto-ley 27/2021, de 23 de noviembre, por el que se _prorrogan determinadas medidas económicas para apoyar la recuperación), which have introduced several_ temporary and extraordinary measures affecting pre-insolvency and insolvency proceedings. _Concept and petition for insolvency_ As a rule, if any Spanish Guarantor becomes insolvent, insolvency proceedings can be initiated in Spain and will be governed by Spanish law. The Spanish Insolvency Law regulates court insolvency proceedings. In Spain, full-blown insolvency proceedings (insolvency), referred to as “concurso de acreedores” apply to all natural persons and legal entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Law, such as public entities). These proceedings may lead either to the restructuring of the business or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets. Spanish insolvency laws may not be as favorable to creditors’ interests as the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions to which you may be familiar with. Below is a brief description of certain aspects of Spanish insolvency laws. In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered when the debtor is in a situation of current insolvency (insolvencia actual) or imminent insolvency (insolvencia inminente). Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is insolvent when it can no longer regularly meet its payment obligations in a timely and regular manner (current insolvency), or when it is aware that it will be unable to meet its payment obligations within a three-month period (imminent insolvency). Insolvency proceedings are available as a type of legal protection that a debtor may request to avoid the attachment of its assets by its creditors. A petition for current insolvency may be initiated by (i) the debtor, in the case of a company, by decision of the management body (voluntary insolvency) (concurso voluntario); (ii) any of its creditors, provided that the creditor requesting the insolvency of a debtor did not acquire the credit within six months before filing the ----- petition for insolvency, through inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit has matured (mandatory insolvency) (concurso necesario); or (iii) certain other interested third parties (also mandatory insolvency) (concurso necesario). However, only the debtor is entitled to file a petition for insolvency on the basis of its imminent insolvency (and in that case, it is not compulsory). The Spanish Insolvency Law provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either (i) a court confirmation of full compliance with all the obligations set forth in an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (the “Company Voluntary Agreement,” or the “CVA”), or (ii) the liquidation of the debtor’s estate. Insolvency proceedings can also conclude, among others, (iii) at any moment, once it is verified that there are insufficient assets to pay post-insolvency credits; (iv) at any moment, once it is verified that all of the credits have been paid, or the situation of insolvency no longer exists; or (v) once it is verified that all of the creditors have waived their credit rights. _Voluntary insolvency_ Insolvency is generally considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the insolvent debtor. The debtor must file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its insolvency situation. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur (as explained in the section on mandatory insolvency below). In the event of failure to file a petition for insolvency within the statutory two-month period, the directors may be held liable for the unpaid claims or the damages arising from the delay. Despite the above, this general rule obliging debtors to file for insolvency within the two-month period does not apply if the debtor notifies the relevant court that it has commenced negotiations with its creditors to obtain support for a Restructuring Plan (as defined below), by means of the communication that is foreseen under Article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the “Creditor Negotiations Notice”). _Pre-insolvency_ Pursuant to Article 585 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, a Creditor Negotiation Notice may be communicated to the competent court by any debtor in the event of: (i) current insolvency (insolvencia actual); (ii) imminent insolvency (insolvencia inminente); or (iii) “likelihood of insolvency” (probabilidad de insolvencia). The Spanish Insolvency Law has introduced the concept of “likelihood of insolvency” (probabilidad de _insolvencia), defined as the situation in which it is objectively foreseeable that the debtor will be unable to_ regularly fulfil its payment obligations that fall due in the next two years unless it enters into a Restructuring Plan with its creditors. In addition to being able to start negotiating with its creditors with a view to entering into a Restructuring Plan at any time during this period when insolvency is likely, the debtor will also be able to file for pre-insolvency in court, in which case it will inform the court that it is trying to negotiate a Restructuring Plan with its creditors. If the debtor files a Creditor Negotiations Notice with the relevant court, the debtor is granted a grace period of three months and one more month to file for insolvency. Such grace period of three months could be extended if, no later than at the end of the initial three-month grace period, either the debtor, or creditors holding more than 50% of the debts that the Restructuring Plan may affect at that time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated claims in an insolvency situation), request the court for a three-month extension, provided the so-called “restructuring expert”, if one is appointed by the relevant Court, issues a favourable report supporting the request. During the three-month period of the Creditor Negotiations Notice (or six in case it has been extended), enforcement actions are stayed, subject to the following: - As a general rule, neither judicial nor extrajudicial enforcement proceedings may be initiated to seize or attach assets or rights that the debtor requires to continue its professional or business activities (the so-called “necessary assets”). Previously initiated enforcement proceedings over assets or rights that the debtor requires to continue its professional or business activities will also be stayed. It is not always easy to determine when an asset is necessary to operate the business and the courts will decide on a case-by-case basis. Courts normally take a flexible approach and consider elements such as cash or credit rights as assets that are necessary to continue to run the business. However, creditors may challenge the court clerk’s asset qualification, which the court will hear. Shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset are not considered an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as ----- long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest granted over those shares/quota shares does not cause the termination or amendment of the insolvent debtor’s contracts with the subsidiary allowing the insolvent debtor to exploit that asset. - At the debtor’s request, the court may extend these stays in relation to one or several creditors or class of creditors in respect of other assets or rights, even if they are not deemed as “necessary assets”, if doing so could help to bring the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion, provided the restructuring expert, if one has been appointed, issues a favourable report supporting of the request. The court decision on this suspension may be challenged by a remedy (recurso de reposición), exclusively. - Subject to the above, enforcing security in rem over “necessary assets” may be initiated but will be automatically stayed. However, neither financial collateral governed by Spanish Royal Decree-Law 5/2005, applicable to financial collateral (“RDL 5/2005”), nor security interests located in another Member State (other than Denmark) should be affected by this suspension. The prevention or suspension of enforcement procedures does not apply to public credit rights (créditos de _derecho público). However, if the enforcement proceeding affects assets or rights that the debtor requires to_ continue its professional or business activities, once initiated, it may be suspended only at the stage of disposal by the judge hearing the case. In the event of an out-of-court enforcement (ejecución extrajudicial), the suspension may be ordered by the judge before whom the Creditors Negotiations Notice has been filed, exclusively at the stage of disposal. This protection will cease once 3 months have elapsed since the filing of the Creditor Negotiations Notice. The Creditor Negotiations Notice can also protect guarantees and security granted by other group companies to the extent certain requirements are met (i.e., when requested by the debtor, proving that the enforcement of the guarantee or security may cause the insolvency of the guarantor and of the debtor itself). Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, ipso facto clauses are banned. The mere submission of the Creditor Negotiations Notice does not affect bilateral agreements with outstanding reciprocal obligations (executory agreements) at that time. Once a period of three months from the Creditor Negotiation Notice has elapsed, the debtor which has not reached a Restructuring Plan shall request the declaration of insolvency within the following month, unless the debtor is not in a current state of insolvency (insolvencia actual). While the effects of the Creditor Negotiation Notice are in force, the insolvency request filed by the debtor may be suspended by the judge at the request of the restructuring expert, if one has been appointed, or of the creditors who, at the time of the request, represent more than 50% of the liabilities that could be affected by the Restructuring Plan. The application must show that the creditors have submitted a Restructuring Plan that is likely to be approved. While the effects of the Creditor Negotiation Notice are in force, the legal duty to resolve the dissolution due to losses that reduce the net worth to an amount lower than half of the share capital will be suspended. _“Pre-pack”_ The Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees certain amendments to the sale of business units regime. In particular, pursuant to Article 224 bis of the Spanish Insolvency Act, the debtor may file, together with the request of the declaration of insolvency, a binding written proposal from a creditor or from a third party for the acquisition of one or more business units. _Mandatory insolvency_ Insolvency is considered necessary (concurso necesario) if filed (among others, such as personally liable shareholders) by a third-party creditor and, in certain cases, by the insolvency mediator (mediador concursal). Under article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if (i) that creditor can prove that the debtor has failed to attach any assets—or sufficient assets—to pay the amount owed; or (ii) that creditor proves before the court a final previous judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency; (iii) there is a generalized default on payments by the debtor; (iv) there is a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets; (v) there is a misplacement, “fire sale” or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (vi) there is a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (three months) prior to filing the relevant insolvency request. On receipt of an insolvency petition by a creditor, the court may order provisional interim ----- measures to protect the assets of a debtor and may request a guarantee from the petitioning creditor requesting the adoption of those measures to cover damages caused by the preliminary protective measures. The relevant debtor may oppose the mandatory insolvency petition, and will have to prove that it is not insolvent, unless the creditor’s insolvency petition is based on: (i) evidence of a previous final judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency; (ii) the failure to seize sufficient assets of the debtor to pay the amounts owed; or (iii) the seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of that debtor’s assets, where the insolvency court will hand down an order declaring the opening of the insolvency proceedings without hearing the debtor. In this case, the insolvency court will then summon the parties to a hearing and will finally issue a court ruling either dismissing the application filed by the creditor or declaring the debtor’s insolvency. _Request of coordinated insolvency_ The insolvency of a company that forms part of a group of companies, including the parent company, does not automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the group. As stated above, a company is insolvent when it cannot regularly meet its payment obligations as they fall due. This analysis is conducted individually at each company level. However, creditors may apply for a coordinated insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors (acumulación de concursos) if (i) the assets are commingled, or (ii) the debtors form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the coordinated insolvency of two or more legal entities can only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must be separately insolvent. Coordinated insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same group. As to ongoing insolvency proceedings, any of the insolvent debtors or the insolvency trustee, as the case may be, can apply for the procedural coordination under certain circumstances (particularly, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of companies). Moreover, creditors may apply for the procedural coordination of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of their debtors already declared insolvent if (i) the assets are commingled, or (ii) they belong to the same group of companies, provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency trustee pursuant to article 41 of the Spanish Insolvency Law. It is important to note that coordinated insolvency proceedings do not entail substantive consolidation. As a result, a “group insolvency” does not generally lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of that group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a financial claim will be subordinated). The current system that the Spanish Insolvency Law provides for is basically a procedure aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost-efficient as possible. However, exceptionally, for the purpose of drafting the insolvency report, which only the insolvency trustee can do, assets and liabilities held between the insolvent companies may be consolidated if the estates and liabilities are commingled to avoid unjustified cost and delay. _Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario_ The obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees of the Spanish Guarantor will not necessarily be enforced in accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, as this enforcement is subject to, _inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish courts, the acceptance by the court of jurisdiction,_ the discretion of the courts, the power of the courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of Spanish law on civil procedure (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamento Civil) (the “Spanish Law on Civil Procedure”) regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law, and other principles of law of general application. In this regard, note the following: - Spanish law does not specifically recognize the concept of an indemnity. Articles 1,152 et seq. of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil) establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish courts may modify the penalty agreed between the relevant parties on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, ----- unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at that partial performance (and the liquidated damages clause is not disproportionate under fairness standards). There is some doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive damages. - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain if that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations from being left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties. - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement from being terminated on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants if the basis for termination is not a breach of an obligation considered material in view of the particular circumstances (which could be the case in the event of termination on the grounds of cross default or cross acceleration), or which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish courts not to enforce any such termination. - Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision when these acts seek a result that is forbidden by or contrary to law will be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided will apply. - A Spanish court may award damages if the specific performance of an obligation is considered impracticable. - A voluntary waiver of statutory rights would not be valid if it were contrary to public order or detrimental to a third party. Furthermore, under Spanish law, the waiver of future rights that do not yet exist or of which there is a mere expectation could be considered null unless ratified upon the rights arising and being perfected. - A Spanish court may modify the obligations deriving from the contracts in the terms it deems necessary to restore the balance between the obligations (or even declare them unenforceable) if unexpected and exceptional circumstances arise that were unforeseeable when the contracts were executed, which would not have been explicitly or implicitly assumed and entail a drastic change in the consideration or the reciprocal obligations assumed in the contracts, to such an extent that a Spanish court would consider strict compliance with the obligations assumed by this party in the contracts as nearly impracticable or extremely burdensome. In fact, there have been cases where Spanish first instance courts (ruling no. 1/2021 of the Court of First Instance no. 20 of Barcelona (8 January 2021); and ruling no. 155/2020 of the Court of First Instance no. 60 of Madrid (30 April 2021) (although the latter precautionary measures were subsequently lifted by the High Court of Appeals of Madrid (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid) upon challenge by the creditors affected by the measure)) have granted injunctive relief (medidas cautelares) applying the “rebus sic stantibus” (“hardship”) doctrine to stop the enforcement of guarantees, even first demand guarantees, when the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19 has upset the balance between the contracting parties, making performance by one to the other unduly burdensome. - Under Spanish procedural law, rules regarding the burden of proof in judicial proceedings cannot be modified by agreement of the parties and, consequently, any provision of the contracts whereby decisions, certificates, notifications, opinions or the like issued by the parties are considered conclusive evidence in the absence of a manifest error would not be upheld by a Spanish court. - Any document that is not in Spanish must be accompanied by an official sworn translation into Spanish for it to be admissible by a Spanish court or authority. - Under Spanish law, powers of attorney, appointments and authorizations are generally revocable by the grantor (irrespective of whether they are said to be revocable or irrevocable) provided that the revocation is in good faith. However, this general rule would not prevail when the powers of attorney, appointments or authorizations are a necessary consequence of the underlying relationship between the grantor and the beneficiary and that revocation is aimed at frustrating the purpose for which those powers were granted. - Finance or security document provisions relating to application of enforcement proceedings might not be enforceable if they contravene any mandatory provisions under Spanish law. - The choice of New York law in the Notes will not restrict the application of the Spanish “overriding mandatory provisions,” as defined in article 9.1 of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008, on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I). Furthermore, Spanish courts may refuse to apply a provision of the chosen law if that application is ----- manifestly incompatible with Spanish public policy. Spanish courts may also give effect to the overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which the obligations arising from the contract have been performed or must be performed. - The exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts includes matters relating to the incorporation, validity, nullification and dissolution of companies or legal entities domiciled in Spain, and any decisions and resolutions of their governing bodies; the validity or nullity of any recording in a Spanish registry; and the recognition and enforcement of any judgment or arbitration award in Spain that has been obtained in a foreign country. _Certain effects of insolvency declaration Effects on the debtor_ As a rule, and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency retains its powers to manage and dispose of its business but is subject to the intervention (intervención) of the insolvency trustee (administrador concursal), who is appointed by the court. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced (sustitución) by the insolvency trustee. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. Also, at the insolvency trustee’s request, the court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null and void. Subject to certain exceptions linked to the maintenance and conservation of the debtor’s estate, the debtor cannot sell or create security over its rights and assets without the court’s authorization until the approval of a CVA (convenio de acreedores) or the opening of the liquidation phase. _Effects on contracts_ Under articles 156-158 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, all clauses in contracts with reciprocal obligations that allow a party to terminate, stay or modify an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency or the opening of the liquidation phase are deemed as not included in the agreement and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws or RDL 5/2005, as defined under it). A declaration of insolvency does not impair the effectiveness of contracts with reciprocal obligations pending performance by both the insolvent party and the counterparty, which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate as post-insolvency credits/ estate claims (con cargo a la masa). However, if there has been a breach of an agreement by either party after it has been declared insolvent, the court can terminate any such contracts at the request of the non-breaching party of the agreement or declare that the agreement remains in force because it is beneficial for the insolvency proceedings (mantenimiento del contrato en interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party is entitled to seek specific performance against the insolvent estate and the claims stemming from that agreement will be considered a post-insolvency credit/estate claims. Likewise, even in the event of non-breach by the counterparty of its obligations under such an agreement after the debtor’s declaration of insolvency, the insolvency trustee (together with the insolvent debtor or at its sole discretion if the insolvent debtor’s powers to manage and dispose of its business have been conferred on the insolvency trustee, as provided above) may ask the insolvency court to resolve the termination of the agreement (on the grounds of it being beneficial for the insolvency proceedings (resolución del contrato en _interés del concurso)). The termination of these contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return—_ and indemnify damages to—its counterpart against the insolvent estate. If the insolvent debtor, the insolvency trustee and the counterparty agree on the termination of the agreement and its effects, the insolvency court will approve the parties’agreement; otherwise, if the insolvency court upholds termination, it will also establish the damages claim to be received by the non-breaching party due to the termination of the agreement. Moreover, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended, except in cases where, (i) under recent case law from the Spanish Supreme Court and Article 152 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, ordinary/legal interest is secured with an in rem right (so long as it is included as a contingent claim in the proof of claims), in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security (9/10 of the collateral fair value minus senior claims in a CVA scenario) (i.e., default interest is stayed following the insolvency declaration); and (ii) wage credits are in favor of employees, accruing the legal interest set forth in the corresponding State Budget Act (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado). ----- _Effects on enforcement proceedings_ As a rule, unsecured creditors’ enforcement rights are suspended on the court declaration of insolvency (with the exception of certain actions conducted by public authorities that do not concern assets necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s commercial or professional activity). Also, once the insolvency proceedings are declared open, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected coercively against the debtor’s assets be continued. The enforcement of any security over certain assets or rights necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s commercial or professional activity may not be commenced and the procedures already initiated before the declaration of insolvency will be suspended for one year. Enforcement will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. - Enforcement of security over certain assets necessary to continue the insolvent company’s commercial or professional activity (in rem security interests) is prohibited until the earlier of (i) the conclusion of a composition agreement (convenio de acreedores), provided that the composition agreement does not affect that right; or (ii) one year from the date the insolvency was declared without the opening of the liquidation phase. Secured creditors will also be allowed to commence or resume enforcement proceedings after one year from the commencement of the liquidation phase (to the extent the relevant collateral is not sold therein). - Enforcement proceedings conducted before other courts or notary publics will be stayed within this oneyear period unless the insolvency court declares that the collateral is not necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s commercial or professional activity. When it comes to determining which of the debtor’s assets or rights are used for its professional or business activities, Spanish courts have generally given a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights (such as cash or credit rights) as assets that are necessary to continue to run the debtor’s business. However, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset are not considered an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest granted over those shares/quota shares does not cause the termination or amendment of the insolvent debtor’s contracts with the subsidiary allowing the insolvent debtor to exploit that asset. The above regime does not affect financial collateral foreseen under RDL 5/2005 (the Spanish law implementing the EU Financial Collateral Directive), which will still be enforceable, or collateral located in another EU member state at the time of the declaration of insolvency. If the collateral is located in a non-EU state at the time of the declaration of insolvency, the automatic stay (if any) and, in general, the effects of the insolvency will be governed by the insolvency law of the state where the collateral is located. Under articles 44, 52 et seq. and 142 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with the insolvency proceedings is extended to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). As a rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings that may affect the insolvent estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in RDL 5/2005) or collateral located in an EU state other the Spain or, subject to local law, a third state). When compatible, to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law). Finally, prospective investors should also note that enforcement of any security interests will be subject to the provisions of Spanish Law on Civil Procedure and the Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable), which may delay the enforcement. _Ranking of claims (priority rules)_ The court decision issued by the competent insolvency court declaring the opening of insolvency proceedings for a particular debtor (auto de declaración de concurso) must specifically request creditors to (i) declare any debts owed to them within one month from the day after the publication of the insolvency proceedings in the ----- Official Gazette of the Spanish State (Boletín Oficial del Estado), and (ii) provide the insolvency trustee with the relevant documentation to justify those credits. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the court insolvency trustee will draw up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classify them according to the categories established in the Spanish Insolvency Law, which are summarized below. Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, claims are classified into two groups: - Post-insolvency credits/estate claims (créditos contra la masa): article 242 of the Spanish Insolvency Law sets out the so-called “estate claims,” which are pre-deductible (when they become due) claims from the estate (excluding any assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security). Debt against the insolvent estate includes, among others (but not limited to), (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll; (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings; (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that are declared to remain in force after the declaration of insolvency, as well as obligations to return and indemnify damages in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor; (iv) claims deriving from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency proceedings concerning bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith); (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion; (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vii) insolvency trustee’s fees; (viii) in case of liquidation, the financing granted to the debtor under a CVA, excluding funds lent by persons closely related to the debtor through a share capital increase, loan or analogous transaction; and (ix) 50% of the interim or new financing lent under a Restructuring Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, as long as the claims affected by the approved Restructuring Plan amount to at least 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities (in case the funds are granted by persons closely related to the debtor, the Restructuring Plan must affect over 60% of the total liabilities of the debtor, excluding the relevant claims held by the persons closely related to debtor). These post-insolvency claims are deemed “super-senior” in the sense that they are not subject to ranking or acknowledgement and, as a default rule, must be paid as and when they fall due; therefore, these claims are given preference over all others, except for proceeds from collateral subject to special privilege claims (as described below). - Insolvency claims (créditos concursales), which are classified as follows: - Special privilege claims (créditos con privilegio especial): Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem security) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security will be limited to the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules set out in articles 273 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, but are subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law. As a rule, secured creditors are not subject to the CVA, except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the CVA and if certain majorities have been reached among secured creditors (see “Conclusion of insolvency—Settlement”). In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which they are secured up to the value of the security. However, the insolvency trustee has the option of stopping the enforcement of the securities and paying these claims as administrative expenses under specific payment rules. The receiver can sell the secured assets during the insolvency proceedings to a third party or to the creditor holding the special privilege debt that is secured by the asset, in each case, subject to certain conditions. The pledged assets might be sold either with the charge or free of the security, by applying the sale proceeds (in the proportion allocated to the secured assets) towards the payment of special privilege debts, subject to the consent of the special privilege creditor in certain scenarios. In the context of the sale of business units that include secured assets, it must be noted that the consent of special privilege creditors is not required when the security is not released and the buyer is subrogated in the debtor’s position. If the sale proceeds applied to satisfy the special privilege debt are lower than the value of the security, the consent of special privilege creditors with collateral included within the business unit sale is required. 75% of the special privilege debts affected by the sale can cram down holdouts. Also, in the context of the insolvency proceedings of a Spanish Guarantor, it must be noted that the insolvency receiver can sell business units to a third party, excluding its creditors from ----- the transfer (barring certain exceptions regulated by law), resulting in a loss of value of the pledge granted over the shares of the Spanish Guarantor. - General privilege claims (créditos con privilegio general): Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among others (but not limited to), (i) specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities; (ii) 50% of the claims held by the creditor that filed for the debtor’s insolvency (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated claims); and (iii) 50% of the interim or new money lent under a Restructuring Plan entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in articles 635 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, as long as the claims affected by the approved Plan amount to at least 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities (in case the funds are granted by persons closely related to the debtor, the Restructuring Plan must affect over 60% of the total liabilities of the debtor, excluding the relevant claims held by the persons closely related to debtor). Similar to secured claims, these general privilege claims are not subject to the CVA unless creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges representing at least 65% (or 75% depending on the workout measures envisaged under the CVA) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of that CVA. In the event of liquidation, they are the first after secured creditors to collect payment against assets other than those secured by a secured claim, in accordance with the ranking established under the Spanish Insolvency Law. - Ordinary claims (créditos ordinarios): Ordinary creditors are those having claims that are not classified as subordinated or privileged claims. They are paid pro rata once the estate claims and the general and special privilege claims have been paid. For a CVA to be deemed approved by either simple majority, 50% or 65% of the ordinary creditors (depending on the workout measures envisaged under the CVA) of the total value of ordinary claims must vote in favor of that CVA. - Subordinated claims (créditos subordinados): Subordinated claims is a category of claims that includes, among others (but not limited to), (i) credits notified late (outside the specific one-month period mentioned above); (ii) credits that are contractually subordinated with regard to all other credits of the debtor; (iii) credits relating to unpaid interest claims (including default interest, regardless of whether they are secured), except for credits secured with an in rem right up to the value of the security interest (if they have been included as a contingent claim in the proof of claims to be sent to the insolvency receiver); (iv) fines; and (v) certain claims of creditors that are “closely related parties”to the insolvent debtor. In the case of legal entities, the following are considered “closely related parties” (personas _especialmente relacionadas): (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (if the shareholders are natural_ persons, this would include any party closely related to these shareholders, as described in this document); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed or has securities listed in a secondary official market) at the time the credit is generated; (iii) directors (de iure, de facto or shadow directors), insolvency liquidators, shadow directors and those holding general powers of attorney on behalf of the insolvent company (including individuals that have held these positions during the two years before the declaration of insolvency); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their respective shareholders, provided those shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements specified in (ii) above (i.e., 10% or 5% if the company is listed). Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be parties closely related to the insolvent debtor if the acquisition has taken place within two years before the insolvency proceedings are declared open. Additionally, “closely related parties”, are not entitled to vote on a Restructuring Plan. Despite the above, creditors that have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights under a Restructuring Plan entered into in compliance with articles 635 et seq of the Spanish Insolvency Law (and even those appointed as directors) will not be considered closely related to the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such Restructuring Plan. Claims related to accrued and unpaid interest, unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem right, are also subordinated. Moreover, those creditors will not be considered shadow directors because of the debtor’s obligations under the viability plan, unless it is proved that they occupy this role. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors. They do not have voting rights under the CVA but are subject to its terms, being paid once the ordinary claims have been satisfied under the CVA. Thus, subordinated creditors have limited chances of collecting payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Law. ----- As an exception to the subordination regime, new financing granted to the debtor under a Restructuring Plan regulated under articles 635 et seq of the Spanish Insolvency Law, which also contemplates a capitalization of credit rights before granting new financing, will not be classified as a subordinated claim under article 281 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, provided that the requirements set out in article 283 of the Spanish Insolvency Law are met. This is an incentive to promote the refinancing and capitalization of credit rights. The claims of the beneficiaries of the Note Guarantees provided by the Spanish Guarantor could be classified as “contingent” (non-crystallized) claims and it may occur that no amounts are recognized (and that the beneficiaries have no voting rights) until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced, resulting in an amount due and payable. _Winding up due to losses sustained in 2020 and 2021_ Act 3/2020, of September 18 (in force from September 20, 2020), established that, for the purposes of the events resulting in a company having to wind up due to the losses specified under article 363.1 e) of the Spanish Companies Act, losses attributable to the 2020 and 2021 financial results will not be taken into account. However, if the 2022 financial results show that the company must be wound up because the losses reduce the company’s net worth to an amount lower than half of its share capital, the administrators must call a general shareholders meeting either to dissolve the company or remedy the wind-up situation. _No termination effect_ The general principle of “no termination effect” is established so that all agreements remain effective at the time of insolvency. Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the existence of contracts entered into by the debtor, which remain in force. Contractual arrangements establishing the termination of a contract with reciprocal obligations or entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the debtor’s declaration of insolvency, or both, are unenforceable. As a rule, a declaration of insolvency does not alter the general contractual rules on termination, but under the Spanish Insolvency Law, if a judge decides to remedy an eventual default of the insolvent party by reinstating an agreement, any outstanding amounts and further payments under the agreement will be postinsolvency claims. To safeguard the insolvent party’s interests, the court may also terminate an agreement with compensation for damages to achieve the best outcome from the insolvency proceedings. There are specific rules for employment agreements, mainly affecting collective dismissals, which are dealt with by insolvency judges. See the section on “Effects on contracts” above for further information. _Set-off_ The Spanish Insolvency Law generally prohibits the insolvent company’s credits and debts from being set off once it has been declared insolvent, although set-offs fulfilling the operating requirements before the declaration of insolvency may still apply. However, a particular creditor may exercise a set-off against the insolvent company if allowed under the law governing the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company in insolvency scenarios. Also, a set-off as part of a master netting agreement is also permitted provided that it complies with the requirements of RDL 5/2005. Set-off is also allowed in connection with credits arising from the same legal relationship. _Hardening periods_ There is no clawback date by operation of law. Therefore, no prior transactions will automatically become void as a result of initiating the insolvency proceedings, but rather the insolvency trustee (or creditors that have asked the insolvency trustee to initiate proceedings due to the latter’s inaction) must expressly challenge any transactions considered detrimental to the insolvent debtor’s estate. Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, particularly article 226, once insolvency has been declared, only transactions that could be considered damaging (perjudiciales) to the insolvent debtor’s estate (i.e., causing “damages to property”) during the two years before the date on which the insolvency is filed may be challenged, even if there was no fraudulent intent. Transactions taking place earlier than two years before the filing for insolvency may be rescinded subject to certain actions set out in the Spanish Civil Code (i.e., fraudulent conveyance, which has a four-year look-back period). The same clawback grounds apply in relation to any detrimental actions carried out within two years preceding the pre-insolvency filing, as well as those carried out since that date up to the declaration of insolvency, even ----- if there has been no fraudulent intent, as long as: (i) a Restructuring Plan has not been passed or, when passed, has not been approved by the court; and (ii) the insolvency is declared within a year of the end of the pre-insolvency period. The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “damages to property” In any case, “damages” does not refer to the parties’ intention, but to the effects of the transaction on the debtor’s interest resulting in damages to the insolvent debtor’s estate or unequal treatment among creditors, triggering the insolvency proceedings (par conditio creditorum). The Spanish Insolvency Law specifies several “irrebuttable presumptions”(iuris et de iure)—namely free disposals (for no consideration) and prepayment or cancellation of the company’s claims or obligations prior to them becoming due and where the due dates of the relevant claims or payment obligations fall after the date of declaration of insolvency—except if those obligations are secured by an in rem security, in which case the transactions would be subject to a rebuttable presumption of “damages to property,” as explained below. Likewise, the Spanish Insolvency Law determines certain actions deemed to cause “damages to property” affecting the insolvent company, but which are “rebuttable presumptions”(iuris tantum), meaning they may be contested by the counterparty—namely, disposals in favor of closely related parties (as described above), the granting of security to secure previously existing obligations or in respect of new obligations replacing existing ones, and the payment or other acts to terminate obligations being secured by an in rem security and that mature after the date of declaration of insolvency. Ordinary transactions carried out in the debtor’s ordinary course of business cannot be rescinded provided that they are carried out at arm’s length. Consequently, if these acts have been performed by the relevant debtor, they may be rescinded if they were carried out during the two-year hardening period and are considered detrimental to that debtor’s estate. Particularly, judges have considered payments made by an insolvent company before a declaration of insolvency to be detrimental, determining that in some situations, a debtor could not be compelled to repay its obligations at the time of payment because it was already unable to regularly pay debts as they became due. Guarantees granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party to secure other group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback on the basis that those guarantees could be considered detrimental to the guarantor’s estate if the guarantor cannot prove that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant the guarantee (beyond an abstract group interest or a general indication of belonging to the same group of companies, or so-called “group interest”). Whether the granting of an upstream guarantee by the guarantor is detrimental to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that needs to be proved on a case-by-case basis (with the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of proof). Case law has sustained that when the parties had envisaged the creation of the security at the time of granting the financing, if there is a solid business reason to delay the constitution of the security, damage would not exist. In this sense, the ruling handed down by Commercial Court no. 1 of Oviedo, dated February 18, 2010 (AC 2010\525), indicated that “to ascertain whether a security is contextual to the creation or cause of the claim, _it must be verified whether the transactions that gave rise to granting the claim and the security were conceived by the parties simultaneously, thus reducing any importance given to potential temporary delays in technically granting the security.”_ If a court resolution rescinds a prejudicial act, the parties involved will be required to return their reciprocal consideration with any accrued revenue or interest (in the case of bilateral contracts; otherwise, only the non-insolvent party is obliged to return this consideration). These claims are generally regarded as estate claims unless the relevant creditor acts in bad faith, in which case its claims will be subordinated. In any case, under article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and article 730 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be subject to clawback actions if those acts or transactions cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means or on any grounds (not only in insolvency scenarios) under laws applicable outside of Spain. Procedurally, there is no safe harbor against a lawsuit being filed and lenders being served to appear before Spanish courts, but the lawsuit should be dismissed on the merits if lenders prove that the act or transaction at issue is (i) subject to foreign law, and (ii) unavoidable due to the circumstances under that foreign law. No insolvency clawback action will apply to Restructuring Plans, or to any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in the performance of these refinancing agreements, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in the section on “Cramdown effects of certain refinancing _agreements.”_ ----- _Restructuring Plans_ The so-called restructuring plans are those aimed at modifying the composition, conditions or structure of the debtor’s assets and liabilities, or its equity, including transfers of assets, productive units or the entire business, as well as any necessary operational changes, or a combination of these elements (a “Restructuring",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The CVA may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors, and it should set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, the CVA must be honored by the debtor and respected by the creditors. ----- The CVA must contain proposals for write offs and stays. Article 317 of Spanish Insolvency Law provides that it may also contain alternative or additional proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including conversion of debt into shares, into profit participating loans, convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the CVA. The Spanish Insolvency Law has also incorporated Article 317 bis, by virtue of which the CVA may include the merger, spin-off or global assignment of assets or liabilities of the insolvent company. In this case, the CVA shall also be signed by the duly authorized representatives of the companies which will be a party to such structural amendments. The proposals in the CVA must include a payment schedule and a viability plan. For a CVA to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities must be met at the creditors’ meeting: (a) If the CVA contains write offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims; stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount for a period not exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans (préstamos participativos) over the same period, at least 50% of votes representing the unsecured claims (ordinary credits) must be in favor of that CVA. However, a simple majority will be sufficient when the CVA consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured claims within a period not exceeding three years, or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary unsecured claims applying a write off of less than 20%. (b) If the CVA contains stays of between five and ten years; write offs of more than 50% of the amount of the claims and, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans over the same period and any other proposal permitted under the Spanish Insolvency Law, 65% of votes representing the unsecured claims (ordinary credits) must be in favor of the CVA. The holders of subordinated credits and creditors considered closely related to the debtor are not entitled to vote. Although, in principle, privileged creditors are not subject to an approved CVA (unless they have expressly voted in its favor), the effects of an approved CVA can be extended to privileged creditors provided that the relevant CVA has been approved by the following majorities of creditors within the corresponding category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors, financial creditors or others): (c) If the CVA contains a write off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than five years, or conversion of debt into profit participating loans, also for a period not exceeding five years, at least 60% of privileged creditors’ votes must be in favor of the CVA. If the CVA contains a write off of more than 50% of the claim, stays (for a period between five and ten years), conversion of debt into profit participating loans also for a period between five and ten years, and any other proposal permitted under the Spanish Insolvency Law, at least 75% of privileged creditors’ votes must be in favor of the CVA. _Liquidation_ Liquidation will occur if the CVA is not approved, or at the debtor’s request at any time. The debtor must file a petition for liquidation if, after a CVA has been approved, it becomes aware that it is no longer able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval of the CVA. In this case, the company will face dissolution and the directors (in the event of voluntary insolvency) will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits will be converted into cash credits. The court, upon commencement of the liquidation phase or at a later stage, with prior hearing to, or report by, the insolvency trustee in a 10 calendar days period, will determine the special liquidation rules the court deems appropriate or modify those already established. This special liquidation rules cannot provide for the liquidation to take more than one year, nor require specific court approval before selling the assets and rights of the debtor. The court may modify or terminate these ----- special liquidation rules at any time, either ex officio, at the insolvency trustee’s request, or at certain creditor’s request (subject to certain thresholds). In the absence of special liquidation rules approved by the court, certain subsidiary rules set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law will apply. The insolvency trustee is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it. _Termination of the insolvency proceedings_ Article 465.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the insolvency proceedings at any stage when it is proved that all credits have been paid, or that all creditors have been entirely satisfied by other means. Finally, it must be noted that article 465.7 of the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees the termination of the insolvency proceedings at any time when there are not enough assets to pay post-insolvency debt, as long as the requirements set out in article 473 of the Spanish Insolvency Law are met, namely no future clawback actions are envisaged, no actions claiming third-party liability are brought, and the court does not qualify the insolvency as culpable (concurso culpable). The Spanish Insolvency Law also includes certain amendments in connection with the qualification of the insolvency as culpable (concurso culpable). In particular, pursuant to Article 449 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, the creditors who had previously submitted allegations for the qualification of the insolvency as culpable (concurso culpable) and also represent at least 5% of the total liabilities or which are holders of claims over one million euro may request the qualification of the insolvency as culpable (concurso culpable) by submitting a reasoned and documented report. _Fraudulent conveyance laws_ Under Spanish law, in addition to an insolvency clawback action, the insolvency trustee and any creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against the debtor and the third party to that contract or agreement provided that it was performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor has no other way of receiving payment of the amounts owed. Although case law is not consistent, it is widely accepted that the following requirements must be met for a creditor to bring an action of this kind: - The debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after that debt was created. - The debtor has performed an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party. - That act was fraudulent. - There is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to seek compensation for the damages suffered. - The debtor’s insolvency, construed as a situation in which the debtor’s estate has decreased significantly, has made it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be proved by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish civil law for the action to succeed. Under article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code, (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure presumption (it cannot be rebutted with evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii), which is a iuris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption). Under article 1,292 of the Spanish Civil Code, payments of debts not yet due and payable made in insolvency may be also rescinded. If the clawback action were upheld, the third party would be liable for returning the consideration received under the contract. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for the damages. The legal term for bringing a clawback claim is four years. _Applicable jurisdiction_ Under European and Spanish law, the applicable jurisdiction to conduct insolvency proceedings is the one in which the insolvent party has its “center of main interests” (“COMI”). The COMI is presumed to be where ----- the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties (although under European Union and Spanish law there is a presumption that a debtor’s COMI is the location of its registered office). Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the COMI are considered “the principal insolvency proceedings”and have a universal reach affecting the insolvent party’s worldwide assets, with certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the COMI is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”). If Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law may apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by the Spanish Guarantor may be classified as “contingent” claims and it may occur that no amounts are recognized until and when the principal debt becomes due and payable (or, based on some precedents, a default by the principal debtor occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced), and the beneficiaries will not have any voting rights. Special rules may apply if the guarantee is not a first demand or joint and several (solidaria) guarantee, but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión), order (orden) and division (división) apply. Please note that other jurisdictions outside the European Union do not require a COMI shift for a Spanish company to file a claim in those jurisdictions (similar to schemes of arrangements in the UK). Yet foreign insolvency proceedings not based on COMI or that do not have a reasonable connection of an equivalent nature under the Spanish Insolvency Law should not be recognized. Also, any creditor could file for nonprincipal insolvency proceedings in Spain.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.5,Plan”).,1852.5.2,Limitations on validity and enforcement of the guarantees and security interests granted by Spanish subsidiaries,"Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (five years from the date on which the obligation becomes enforceable being the general term established for obligations in personam under article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code, as amended by Act 42/2015, of October 5, 2015), or may be or become subject to the defense of setoff or counterclaim. Also, article 1,851 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor without the guarantor’s consent extinguishes the guarantee (in the sense that it is limited to the original term, although case law has established exceptions where the extension benefits both the debtor and the guarantor). In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary obligation is terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be considered null and void. If the guarantor or security provider is able to prove there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, the Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor’s or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that are less favorable than those applying to the principal debtor. In addition, a guarantee or security interest cannot be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and it could be affected by an amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations. Spanish courts may not accept the acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default is negligible. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would be forbidden under article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code. All acts and transactions performed and carried out by a Spanish company must be in pursuit of and aligned with its corporate benefit and interests. Particularly, directors have a duty to act in the best interest of the Spanish company, although there is no specific Spanish mandatory provision of law requiring an express and direct corporate benefit. The absence of a corporate benefit and interests may constitute grounds to challenge these acts and transactions. When assessing whether directors have acted in the best interest of a Spanish company, only the interest of that Spanish company is taken into account. Accordingly, transactions undertaken for the benefit of the group may not always be considered consistent with the best interest of the Spanish company. In the context of upstream and cross-stream guarantees, the Spanish Supreme Court has ruled that the subsidiary granting the guarantee or security interest to secure the debt of its parent company or other company of its group should receive some kind of consideration or benefit, either directly or indirectly, to compensate the financial burden assumed in the interest of the group. This compensation must ----- (i) be verifiable, even if it is not received at the same time as the delivery of the guarantee or security; (ii) be adequate and proportional to the burden assumed by the relevant company in the interest of its group; and (iii) have an economic value. Furthermore, the action undertaken in the interest of the group must be justified and must not jeopardize the solvency of the subsidiary. _Financial assistance_ Furthermore, the Spanish Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes and Note Guarantees or under any security instrument granted by it cannot extend to an obligation that, if incurred, would constitute a breach of the Spanish financial assistance rules. According to these rules, the Spanish Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees or any security granted or executed by the Spanish Guarantor: - cannot extend to the proceeds of the Notes being used to acquire shares representing the share capital of the Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company, or to refinance a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of the Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company; and - will be considered not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor if it implies unlawful financial assistance as provided under article 150 (for Spanish public limited companies (sociedades anónimas)) or article 143 (for Spanish private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada)) of Royal DecreeLaw 1/2010, of July 2 (Ley de Sociedades de Capital) (the “Spanish Companies Act”), in which case all provisions of the guarantee or security will be construed accordingly in the sense that no Note Guarantees or security given by the Spanish Guarantor can provide unlawful financial assistance of this kind. More specifically, Spanish law prohibits financial assistance from being granted to (i) Spanish public limited companies for the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company, and (ii) Spanish private limited companies, for the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law governing guarantees or security interests granted or assumed by subsidiaries organized under the laws of Spain does not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of the Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of the group, as the security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of articles 150 and 143 of the Spanish Companies Act. This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt, although this is widely debated among scholars. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by a Spanish subsidiary will not apply if the proceeds are used to repay the Issuer’s existing indebtedness and the existing indebtedness was used for the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the guarantee granted by a Spanish company will be limited by the amount of funds not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes. For the purposes of the paragraphs above, any reference to a Guarantor’s “holding company” or “parent company” means the company that directly or indirectly owns the majority of the Guarantor’s voting rights or that may have a dominant influence on that Guarantor. It will be presumed that one company has a dominant influence on another company when any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de Comercio) arise. _Principle of specialty (principio de especialidad) and principle of ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad)_ One of the guiding principles of Spanish law on security interests is the so-called principle of specialty (principio de especialidad), which means that, as a rule, a security interest can secure only one main obligation and its ancillary obligations such as interest and costs, but not two or more main obligations at the same time. In principle, where two different main obligations are to be secured, two different security interests must be created. No statutory provision of Spanish law regulates the possibility of simultaneously creating a diversity of in rem pledges of equal rank over the same asset or right. In this respect, many scholars believe that the creation of two or more pledges over a certain asset or right is legally possible and that, similarly, those pledges may rank pari passu among themselves. This opinion is based on the fact that Spanish law allows for concurrent and second or subsequent ranking real estate mortgages, even though it should be pointed out that not all scholars agree, and that there is no case law for or against the analogical application of the legal principles concerning mortgages to the ordinary pledge (prenda común). Therefore, there are grounds to sustain the effectiveness of concurrent equal ranking pledges governed by Spanish law, although the competent courts may take a different view, considering these pledges ineffective and not admissible. Furthermore, it is important to note that, unlike other jurisdictions, Spanish law does not specifically regulate the possibility of creating a single global pledge to secure several obligations (a floating charge), although ----- global real estate mortgages are permitted under the Spanish Mortgage Act. Therefore, there are also grounds to sustain the validity of global pledges, despite the competent courts potentially holding a different view. Given the above, any security interest governed by Spanish general civil law (derecho común) may be created to secure several obligations (either one security per obligation or as a global security), but as this is not specifically foreseen and has not been tested by the Spanish courts, a ruling might hold a security of this kind to be void and null. Likewise, another general principle on which Spanish law on security interests is based is the principle of ancillary nature (principio de accesoriedad), by virtue of which a guarantee, pledge or mortgage must secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant security agreement. Therefore, the security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails the nullity of the security, and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the security. If the security providers can prove there are no existing and valid secured obligations, the Spanish courts may consider that the secured obligations under the relevant guarantees or security interests are not enforceable. _Security interests consisting of share pledges_ On the foreclosure of a pledge over the shares of a Spanish company incorporated as a Spanish private limited company, the shareholders and the company (if so provided in the company’s bylaws) will have preemption rights over the shares that are being foreclosed. Also, on the foreclosure of a pledge over the shares of a Spanish company incorporated as a public limited company, (only if so provided in the bylaws), the shareholders and the company whose shares are pledged will have pre-emption rights. This may delay the enforcement process or affect the value of the shares. _Equity requirements_ Under Spanish law, some provisions on capitalization must be taken into account when guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), within certain terms provided by law, unless the balance between its net equity and its share capital is restored, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency. Under the Spanish Companies Act, Spanish companies (both public limited companies and private limited companies) may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to private limited companies. _Enforcement of pledges_ The law regulating the enforcement of pledges through auctions organized by notaries as described in the Notary Public Act, of May 28, 1862 (the “Notary Public Act”), was significantly amended by Act 15/2015, of July 2, on voluntary jurisdiction (“Act 15/2015”). There is considerable uncertainty as to this new legal framework because some provisions of the Notary Public Act seem to conflict with laws regarding the enforcement of pledges that were not repealed by Act 15/2015. As a result, certain aspects of these types of auctions are open to interpretation. Given that the amendments to the Notary Public Act brought about by Act 15/2015 entered into force on October 15, 2015, there are no precedents clarifying how Act 15/2015 should be applied. Consequently, the clauses in pledge agreements governing auctions organized by notaries may not be enforceable in accordance with their own terms. If in the course of the foreclosure of a security interest, the pledged assets are allocated to or acquired by the secured creditor, a Spanish court may order the secured creditor to discharge the secured debt fully—as opposed to partially—regardless of any provision to the contrary in the relevant security agreement. _Issuance restrictions_ Under the Spanish Companies Act, Spanish companies (both public limited companies and private limited companies) may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to private limited companies. In particular, under article 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the issuance by a Spanish company incorporated as a private limited company is subject to the following restrictions: private limited companies (i) can only issue notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice their own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge over securities, a public guarantee or a joint and several guarantee from a credit ----- institution; and (ii) are prohibited from issuing or guaranteeing (or providing security for) notes convertible into shares (participaciones sociales). If a court rules that the limitation in point (i) above will also apply to the guarantee or provision for security of notes by Spanish companies organized under the form of private limited companies, the Note Guarantees provided by any Spanish Guarantor incorporated as a limited company will be limited accordingly. Regarding the restrictions applicable to Spanish private limited companies, there is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners, or any case law regarding the interpretation of article 401 of the Spanish Companies Act. Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (five years being the general term established for obligations in personam under article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination of them) mean that all obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents may be type enforced by Spanish courts. They do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will, in any event, be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; - Spanish public policy (overriding mandatory provisions); and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim. Without notarization of the security documents and provision of originals or enforceable copies (primeras _copias o copias autorizadas con efectos ejecutivos) of the notarial documents together with the lawsuit, the_ secured parties cannot access the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, and the secured parties must follow the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario). See the section on “Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario” for other factors that may limit the enforcement of contracts. _Trust under Spanish law_ Spanish law security interests must be granted in favor of each secured party, and each secured party must accept them. As Spanish law does not sanction the concept of security agent or that of trustee, Spanish courts may not recognize either one. Therefore, in cases where an entity acts as security agent or trustee of the actual beneficiaries of the security interest or a guarantee (i.e., the creditors of the secured obligations), that security agent or trustee must be duly empowered for that purpose at the time it takes on that role. Otherwise, the security interest or guarantee will not be validly created in favor of its purported beneficiaries. Particularly, since the noteholders will have no power to accept and enforce the Spanish law security interests securing the Notes except through the security agent or the trustee, whose authority to represent the holders and to enforce the Spanish law security interests in their name and for their benefit is established in documents governed by New York law, there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the noteholders as secured parties, and whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes not identified as registered holders in a Spanish law security document will be validly secured or whether the security agent would only be able to enforce the guarantees or the security interest in respect of those obligations. These limitations may be overcome if the creditors grant formal powers of attorney in favor of the security agent for the latter to represent them in the enforcement proceedings, although there is no uniform case law on this point. The noteholders, from time to time, will be the beneficial holders of any Spanish law security interests. However, it is envisaged that they will not be parties to the Spanish law security documents executed by the security agent on their behalf and the noteholders will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of those security interests except through the security agent (even if they are the direct beneficiaries of the security interests). Although it could be argued that article 429 of the Spanish Companies Act could apply by analogy, as it basically states that the representative of the syndicate of the noteholders (comisario) may enforce any security interest on behalf of all noteholders under certain circumstances, it cannot be ruled out that if the security ----- agent is to enforce the security interest, it may need to prove that it is duly and expressly empowered for this purpose by means of a power of attorney granted in its favor by each of the secured parties. This must be notarized and, if applicable, bear an apostille of the Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961, or legalized. Therefore, there could be a delay in the enforcement of the Spanish security documents while the security agent obtains these powers and the relevant public deeds are granted. In the absence of the above powers of attorney, the security agent may be unable to enforce the relevant Spanish collateral on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the noteholders), and there is a risk that the security agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it holds individually, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as security agent. Further, beneficial holders of the security who have not accepted the security or empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the security agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective—including without limitation in an insolvency scenario—as unsecured creditors. It is worth noting that there is a risk that the relevant court or notary public before whom a Spanish security interest may be enforced will request the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of each of the transfer certificates regarding each transfer of the Notes. Likewise, the validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the security agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not contemplated under Spanish law in a situation where the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the security agent’s ability to represent the applicable trustee and the noteholders may be challenged. _Parallel debt_ Parallel debt structures have not been tested under Spanish law and we cannot assure that creating a structure of this kind will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability by the security agent. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or enforceability of the security interests created by the security documents were successful, the noteholders may be unable to enforce the security. Also, under Spanish law, if the relevant obligor enters into insolvency proceedings, the securities or the parallel debt obligation could be challenged by an insolvency administrator, the obligor itself or by other creditors of that obligor under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Spanish insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor. Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the security agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not contemplated under Spanish law in a situation where the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. _Corporate benefit in cross-collateral security structures_ The Spanish Guarantor will be creating the Spanish security as security of the Notes issued by a company of the group receiving the financing under the Notes, so it is arguable whether the Spanish Guarantor has obtained a corporate benefit for granting the relevant Note Guarantees or collateral over their assets. Unlike other jurisdictions, the concept of “corporate benefit” is not specifically regulated under the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation. However, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, have recently declared null or rescinded upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees or security interests in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent company or other companies of its group for the purposes of article 226 of the Spanish Insolvency Law (i.e., clawback of these actions during the two year hardening period, as described above), when the obligations guaranteed or secured do not directly benefit the Spanish company granting the guarantee or security interest. The Spanish Supreme Court has recently issued several rulings in favor of the validity and enforceability of these guarantees and security interests in cases where it can be proved that there is a direct benefit for the Spanish company, and not only for the group to which it belongs (e.g., if amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the guarantee or security interest or indirectly on-lent, or otherwise made available to that company under an intercompany loan agreement, equity contribution or similar arrangement). Other ----- courts have also considered indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group to which the company belongs and the granting of parent guarantees, indemnities and comfort letters for which the relevant company obtains the most favorable economic and financial conditions under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in accordance with Spanish case law on the construction of the notion of “compensatory advantage” (ventaja compensatoria), but always focused on the benefit of the Spanish company (not only for the group). However, there is no certainty that further proof of the existence of benefits and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to the court, the insolvency trustee or the insolvency court in an insolvency scenario where the noteholders’ claims, particularly “special privilege claims,” may be challenged if the insolvency trustee or other creditors allege that the corporate benefit did not exist. _First demand guarantee_ Despite not being specifically regulated under the Spanish Civil Code, the validity and effectiveness of first demand guarantees (garantías a primer requerimiento) have been admitted in several judgments and regulated by the Spanish Supreme Court as a separate guarantee, detached from the underlying agreement the obligations of which are being guaranteed, thus acknowledging the validity of the provision under which the guarantor agrees not to rely on exceptions other than those arising from the guarantee. However, case law has admitted, with certain limitations, that guarantor may object to the guarantee, relying on the exception of fraud, bad faith or abuse of rights (abuso de derecho), in cases where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or with bad faith. Likewise, case law has also admitted that the guarantor may stay the enforcement by showing there has been no event of default (the guarantor bearing the burden of proof), usually through a declaratory relief filed by the guarantor requesting the stay of the enforcement proceedings. Moreover, recent court precedents have tightened the requirements for a guarantee to be characterized as a first demand guarantee rather than an ordinary guarantee (fianza). Although the above case law and court precedents are related to guarantees contractually governed by Spanish law, some of their findings may be regarded as being part of the Spanish contractual public policy. _Financial collateral arrangements_ RDL 5/2005 implements, among others, provisions related to the special regime for security interests over cash and securities. However, to benefit from the provisions of RDL 5/2005, the parties to the security documents must be those referred to in article 4 (mainly public entities, credit entities and financial institutions in accordance with article 1.5 of Directive 2006/48/EC of June 14, 2006), and the object of the security must consist exclusively of (i) cash, meaning money paid into an account in any currency; (ii) securities and other financial instruments as defined in the Securities Market Act and its implementing regulations, and any other direct or indirect regulations over them (the shares of Spanish companies incorporated as a private limited company would not qualify as securities or financial instruments, and there is an uncertainty as to whether the shares of non-listed companies incorporated as a Spanish public limited company or those represented by titles would qualify as securities or financial instruments to these effects, as we are not aware of this having been tested before Spanish courts); and (iii) credit claims, meaning pecuniary claims arising from an agreement under which a credit institution grants credit in the form of a loan or a credit to an entity (other than or micro or small enterprises, save where the collateral taker or the collateral provider of those credit claims is one of the institutions referred to in article 4.1(d) of RDL 5/2005). Only if a security qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement as provided under RDL 5/2005 can that security be enforced by means of direct appropriation. Otherwise, the security will be enforced through other available procedures, such as judicial proceedings, in accordance with articles 681 to 698 of the Spanish Act on Civil Procedure, or notarial proceedings in accordance with article 1,872 of the Spanish Civil Code. In both cases, the relevant asset is required to be sold by public auction. If the sale price obtained in the public auction exceeds the outstanding secured amount, the amount by which it exceeds the outstanding secured amount must be delivered to the security provider. Judicial or notarial procedures can be very complex and long (as they may be subject to formalities, granting of judicial powers of attorney, waiting periods, legal notice requirements, valuation of assets, material costs and expenses, among others) and the result may differ from what was expected or might not be successful. _Further considerations on certain Spanish security interests_ Under Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the lex rei sitae (the law where the property is situated). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as receivables or intercompany loans— the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical existence. In these cases, several ----- theories have been construed among Spanish scholars to determine the lex rei sitae (such as the tax residence of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, the pledgor’s tax residence, and the law governing the credit right being pledged). If a judge considers that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish security documents is governed by Catalan law, the regulations of that autonomous region would govern those pledges instead of Spanish common law, which could affect the validity of those pledges. Also, under Spanish law, the law governing the pledge over shares of a Spanish public limited company the nominative certificates of which are issued is the law of the jurisdiction where those certificates are located. If the certificates were moved to a particular place at the time of or shortly before creating the pledges, and that place had no connection with the security agreement or with the obligations secured under it, a judge could consider that the lex rei sitae is not the place stated in the pledge and may apply a different law to determine the validity and enforceability of the pledge against third parties.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.5,Plan”).,1852.5.3,,"Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the effects of a Restructuring Plan, as set out in Articles 614 et seq., can be imposed on all types of creditors and claims (subject to specific exceptions), including public creditors (subject to strict requirements), one or multiple classes of creditors and, where applicable, to shareholders. The Restructuring Plan must include a minimum content provided for in Article 633 of the Spanish Insolvency Law and will need to be formalized in a public document (formalizado en instrumento público). In addition, a Restructuring Plan under the Spanish Insolvency Law may contain a great variety of acts and operations, provided these are sufficient and proportionate to ensure the viability of the business and its continuation as a going concern. The debtor and its creditors may agree on a great variety of measures deemed necessary to effectively restructure the debtor’s business, including changes in the composition, conditions or structure of its assets and liabilities, or any part of its capital structure. This could include sales of assets, parts of the business or even the entire business as a going concern, as well as any other necessary operational changes, or a combination of the above. The Restructuring Plan must nevertheless set out, among others, the reasons why it has a “reasonable prospect” (perspectiva razonable) of preventing the insolvency of the debtor and ensuring the viability of its business, including the necessary conditions for its success. The creditors affected by the Restructuring Plan must be gathered into classes, which are envisaged by the parties to the Restructuring Plan. Class formation depends on the existence of a “common interest based on objective criterion” (e.g., insolvency rank). Claims with the same insolvency ranking may be separated into different classes when there are sufficient reasons to justify it. For these purposes, attention shall be paid, in particular, to the financial or non-financial nature of the claim, to the conflict of interest that creditors forming part of different classes may have, or to how the claims will be affected by the Restructuring Plan. The Spanish Insolvency Law allows the debtor or the creditors whose claims represent more than 50% of the total liabilities affected by the approved Plan to accede to a prior judicial confirmation on class formation. Claims secured by assets of the debtor shall constitute a single class, unless the diversity of the encumbered assets or rights justifies their separation into two or more classes. Public credit rights (créditos de derecho público) shall constitute a separate class among the classes of the same insolvency ranking. The Restructuring Plan shall be considered approved by a class of affected creditors if more than two-thirds of the liabilities corresponding to that class has voted in favor. In the event that the class consists of secured claims, the Restructuring Plan shall be deemed approved if three-fourths of the liabilities corresponding to this class have voted in favor. If the Restructuring Plan affects claims which are subject to a syndication agreement, the majorities referred to in the above paragraph will apply (unless a lower majority is set forth in the syndication agreement). The approval of a Restructuring Plan, by itself, shall not affect the agreements with outstanding reciprocal obligations. In particular, contractual clauses establishing the other party’s power to suspend or modify the obligations or the effects of the agreement, as well as the power to terminate the agreement on the mere ground of the filing of the application for approval or its admission for processing, the judicial approval of the plan or any other circumstance analogous or directly related to the above, shall be deemed not to have been put into effect. The agreements which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business or professional activity shall not be suspended, modified, terminated or early terminated merely because the Restructuring Plan entails a change of control of the debtor. During the negotiation of a Restructuring Plan, the debtor may request the amendment or termination of any agreements with outstanding reciprocal obligations when such amendment or termination is necessary for the successful completion of the restructuring and to prevent insolvency. _Cramdown effects of certain Restructuring Plans—Court approval (homologación)_ Court approval (homologación) of the Restructuring Plan shall be necessary in any of the following cases: (i) when it is intended to extend its effects to creditors or classes of creditors who had not voted in favor of the ----- Restructuring Plan or to the shareholders of the debtor; (ii) when it is intended to terminate agreements in the interest of the restructuring; and (iii) when it is intended to protect the interim financing and the new financing provided for in the Restructuring Plan, as well as the acts, operations or businesses carried out in this context against clawback actions. The application for approval of the Restructuring Plan may be filed by the debtor or by any affected creditor who has executed it and shall be signed by both a court agent (procurador) and an attorney (abogado). Court approval of a Restructuring Plan may be sought merely to ring-fence it from potential clawback if the debtor becomes insolvent (i.e., without seeking to cram down dissenting creditors). The court will verify that the relevant majorities required for court approval are met prior to approving the Restructuring Plan. The Restructuring Plan might become binding for both (i) dissenting creditors in classes where a majority has been achieved (i.e., an intra-class cram down); and (ii) creditors in classes where no majority has been achieved (i.e., a cross-class cram down). For a cross-cram down to happen, the Restructuring Plan must meet one of the following two requirements: (i) it must be supported by a simple majority of the classes, provided at least one of those classes is composed of claims that would benefit from a general or special privilege (i.e. secured claims) if the debtor were declared insolvent; or, failing that, (ii) it must be supported by at least one of the classes that is “in the money” (i.e. any class that could, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going concern, be reasonably presumed to receive any payment according to the ranking of liquidation priorities applicable under the Spanish Insolvency Law). The effects of a cross-class cram down are subject to some practical limitations. If the Restructuring Plan affects a class of claims secured by rights in rem, and that class has rejected the Restructuring Plan by a majority of dissenting votes over favorable votes, any secured dissenting creditor of that class will have the right to: (a) enforce the underlying security interest (which will accelerate the underlying secured claim) within a month of the court ruling approving the Restructuring Plan being published in the Public Insolvency Registry. If the proceeds obtained from the enforcement (i) are lower than the security value of the collateral set out in the Restructuring Plan, the creditor will keep those proceeds in full (security value equals the “reasonable value” minus legally preferred claims). Any deficit will remain unsatisfied, or (ii) are higher than the security value collateral set out in the Restructuring Plan, but lower than the original claim, the creditor will keep those proceeds in full. Any excess will be deducted from the amounts that the creditor’s unsecured part of the claim would be entitled to receive pursuant to the Restructuring Plan; or (b) instead, and only if expressly provided in the Restructuring Plan, wait to receive a cash payment for the amount of the secured claim that is covered by the security value of the collateral within no more than 120 days. If payment is not received in a timely manner, the affected creditor will be entitled to enforce the security interest. Pursuant to Article 653 et seq of the Spanish Insolvency Law, a dissenting class subject to a haircut will be allowed to challenge the Restructuring Plan based on, among other, a more junior class (or the equity holders) receiving any payment from—or maintaining any interest in—the debtor under the Restructuring Plan. The Spanish Insolvency Law, however, contains certain exceptions to the absolute-priority rule. Besides the absolute priority rule, Spanish law provides for a number of grounds to challenge the Restructuring Plan, which depend on whether all classes or the shareholders approve the Restructuring Plan. These challenges can be filed once the homologation of the Restructuring Plan is granted by the relevant court, or at an earlier stage, if so requested by the party seeking homologation. _Protection in case of insolvency Protection of interim and new money_ The Spanish Insolvency Law specifically protects the following forms of financing granted by any party (whether they are or not an existing creditor) in the context of a Restructuring Plan: (a) Interim financing: defined as new financing granted to the debtor that is reasonable and immediately needed to (i) ensure that the debtor’s activity continues totally or partially while the Restructuring Plan is being negotiated (and until a court approves it); or (ii) maintain or increase the value of the debtor’s business or business units. ----- (b) New financing: defined as new financing granted to the debtor that is provided for in the Restructuring Plan and is necessary for its implementation. Interim and new financing may benefit from two effects: (a) Protection against clawback: under the same terms as any other actions or transactions resulting from the Restructuring Plan. As a special rule, in order to protect interim or new financing lent by a “specially related party”to the debtor from clawback, the claims affected by the Restructuring Plan (after deducting the claims held by that specially related lender) must represent more than 60% of the debtor’s liabilities. Otherwise, they will be subject to the ordinary clawback regime. (b) Preferential treatment for repayment of interim or new money: in the event of the debtor’s insolvency, 50% of the interim or new financing provided in the framework of a judicially sanctioned Restructuring Plan will be treated as an estate claim (crédito contra la masa). The remaining 50% will be treated as a generally privileged claim (crédito con privilegio general). This preferential treatment will only apply if the claims affected by the Restructuring Plan exceed the minimum thresholds described above with respect to the debtor’s total liabilities (i.e., 51% in general, and 60% if interim or new financing is granted by a “specially related party” to the debtor). _Protection of certain Restructuring Plans against clawback_ Neither Restructuring Plans nor transactions, acts and payments accomplished, or any guarantees created in connection with such Restructuring Plans will be subject to an action to clawback, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below. In order to seek protection against clawback, Restructuring Plans can be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct a potential insolvency proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such Restructuring Plans. Anyhow, Restructuring Plans approved according to the Spanish Insolvency Law but not judicially sanctioned are not subject to clawback provisions either. If the Restructuring Plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the following will not be subject to clawback unless it is proven that they were made with an intent to defraud creditors: - actions and transactions that were “reasonable”and “immediately necessary”for the successful negotiation of the Restructuring Plan, if expressly identified as such in the Restructuring Plan. Any payment of (i) fees or costs in relation to negotiating, signing or confirming the Restructuring Plan; (ii) fees for legal and professional advice with close relationship with the restructuring; (iii) employee salaries for completed works; and (iv) other amounts in the ordinary course of the debtor’s business activity, will be deemed to be protected actions and transactions; - interim and new money, including that provided by specially related parties; and - actions and transactions that are reasonable and immediately necessary to implement the Restructuring Plan. If the Restructuring Plan affects claims that represent less than 51% of the debtor’s total liabilities, the actions and transactions described above may still be subject to clawback, but none of the rebuttable presumptions of detriment explained in section Hardening Periods will apply. Therefore (as long as none of the non-rebuttable presumptions apply), the insolvency trustee or the creditor requesting the clawback will need to evidence the detriment. Judicially sanctioned Restructuring Plans will not be subject to the bankruptcy clawback action, but they may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

To the extent any Belgian Guarantor has its statutory seat (statutaire _zetel/siège social) in Belgium or to the extent that Belgium is the territory in which the center of a Belgian_ Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. This also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law, subject to certain exemptions. In case of a branch in Belgium, the EU Insolvency Regulation and Belgian law also allows secondary bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose center of main interests is not situated in Belgium. The effects of those secondary bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Book XX (“Insolvency of Undertakings”) of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, as inserted by the Act of August 11, 2017 and as amended from time to time (hereafter the “Belgian Insolvency Law”). The Belgian Insolvency Law provides for two main insolvency proceedings: judicial reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite). Note that in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire). The latter proceedings will not be further discussed. Belgium is currently implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. The implementation will have an impact on the available reorganization proceedings. However, the date of implementation is still uncertain and no official legal texts are available yet. _Judicial reorganization_ A debtor may (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital, the continuity of the enterprise is presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed. As from the filing of the petition with the competent commercial court overseeing the judicial reorganization and for as long as such court has not issued a judgment thereon, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. Furthermore, during this period, with limited exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be realized by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The filing of the petition does not, however, have a suspensory effect if the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than six months ago (unless the court decides otherwise). The Belgian Insolvency Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and within 8 days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court may decide to open the judicial reorganization procedure, thereby, granting a temporary moratorium to the debtor for a period of maximum six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial administrator in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended (once or several times) up to a total maximum period of twelve months as from the judgment opening the judicial reorganization. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension ----- of the moratorium period for six months. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the special rules that apply when a debtor has already requested and obtained a judicial reorganization procedure in the last 3 years before the new request, are currently suspended but should come into effect again as of 1 April 2023. The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims (i.e., for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization proceedings) in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s moveable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with limited exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immoveable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued. If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium (provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment the pledge is created) (note that a pledge of a business or other universality including receivables is not considered as a pledge specifically with respect to receivables), and the holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (e.g., the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law of December 15, 2004, as amended (Wet Financiële Zekerheden/Loi sur les Sûretés Financières) (the “Belgian",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.7,"Financial Collateral Law”), such as shares in a Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the",1852.7.1,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the Public Prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of ‘main insolvency proceedings’ opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de _paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement du crédit). Cessation of payments is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they_ fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for administering the bankruptcy and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court if such sale is detrimental to their rights. Any interested party may request the temporary continued operation of the business if this is not detrimental to the creditors. The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can however agree to continue to perform under such contracts. The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to temporarily continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order) or whether to terminate ongoing contracts unilateral if such termination is required for administrating the bankrupt estate. Such decisions will not impair any rights in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the bankruptcy receiver decides not to continue the performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days term, the counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract. ----- As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account, falling with the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate credits (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse). For creditors with claims secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension would normally be limited until the filing of the first report of claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year as from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The bankruptcy receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the first report of claims has been filed. The court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social security debts. The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general overview of such rules: - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called “estate debts,” have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization). - Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests. - Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured creditors (and secured/privileged creditors if the security/privilege did not allow such creditors to be paid in full) who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated). - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest does not fall within the grantor’s corporate object as described in its articles of association, then such guarantee or security interest could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void. Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or ----- security interests for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. The assessment of whether or not the grant of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest is in each of the Belgian guarantor’s own corporate interest, is largely dependent on factual considerations and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the board of directors or director(s) of each of the Belgian guarantors at the time of the granting of the guarantees or the security interests, in anticipation of their enforcement and to be reviewed ultimately on a case-by-case basis at the time of the enforcement by the competent courts. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that such Belgian guarantor would derive from the transaction; this is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees. It is generally considered by legal scholars that at least the following principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the Belgian guarantor in issuing the guarantee must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction; and (ii) the financial support granted by the Belgian guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when the aforementioned conditions are met. The responsibility for such assessment lies with the board of directors or director(s) of the Belgian guarantors. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the board of directors or director(s) of the Belgian guarantor may be held liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances, i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods”(misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de biens sociaux). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest may also be held liable on the basis of the principles of tort liability. Alternatively, the guarantee or security interest could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit and, under certain circumstances, the creditor could be held liable on the basis of the principles of tort liability for any guarantee or security interest amount in excess of such amount. These rules have however seldom been tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee or security interest for liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, security documents and guarantees to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture (or the accession document in relation thereto) will contain limitation language on the basis of which the total maximum guarantee liabilities of certain Belgian guarantors (in case of an upstream or cross stream guarantee) under the Indenture will be limited. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit. _Financial assistance_ Any guarantee or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitutes a breach of the provisions on financial assistance as defined by article 5:152 or 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, whichever is applicable, might not be enforceable. Any guarantee or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor shall therefore not include and shall not extend to cover any payment obligation in respect of the proceeds of the Notes used to fund, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of shares of such Belgian Guarantor to the extent that by assuming such obligation the Belgian Guarantor would be deemed to be providing prohibited financial assistance to the acquisition of its own shares or capital participations, as prohibited under Article 5:152 or 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations dated March 23, 2019, as amended from time to time. Therefore, such payment obligations shall be excluded from the guarantee or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor. _Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer_ In the event that bankruptcy proceedings are governed by Belgian law, certain transactions may be declared ineffective against third parties if concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte). The hardening period is the period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy. In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition to declare a debtor ----- bankrupt) is deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order, and accordingly there is in principle no hardening period. However, the court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company and there would be a hardening period from that date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy. The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue or on extremely beneficial terms for the counterparty, (ii) payments for debts which are not yet due, and (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) new security interests provided for pre-existing debts. The legal provisions with regards to the judicial reorganization proceedings provide for a number of exceptions. The Belgian bankruptcy receiver may request the court to declare payments of a Belgian Guarantor during the hardening period for debts due ineffective against third parties provided that it can be proven that the creditor concerned was aware of the cessation of payment of the company. If the guarantee or security interest granted by a Belgian Guarantor were successfully held ineffective (based on the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the realization of such security interest. Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be declared ineffective, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed and the date of registration. The bankruptcy receiver may also obtain a court ruling that a transaction or payment is not enforceable against the bankrupt’s estate, regardless when such transaction or payment took place, if such transaction or payment was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect the creditors’ rights. Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana). _Recognition and enforcement_ The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of or failure to perform any of such conditions may render such security interests invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (e.g., judicial or non-judicial consent or, for movable assets not governed by the Belgian Financial Collateral Law (such as receivables), prior notification to the pledgor) and may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute, in which case any interested party may request a judge at any moment in time to intervene, and such request would suspend the foreclosure. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security over certain movable assets and financial collateral can be out of court, however any interested party may request an a posteriori control from the court with respect to such enforcement. Enforcement of guarantees or security interests may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which they may review. _Grace periods_ In addition, enforcement rights may, like those of any other creditor, be subject to Article 1244 of the (old) Belgian Civil Code. Pursuant to the provisions of these articles, Belgian courts may, in any civil proceeding involving a debtor, defer or otherwise reasonably reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations. Belgian courts can also decide that the interest rate applicable be reduced if it is considered to exceed the normal rate applicable to similar debts. ----- _Role of the security agent_ Belgian pledges over financial collateral (such as the shares of a Belgian Guarantor) or over movable assets (such as receivables of a Belgian Guarantor) have been or will be granted to the Security Agent acting in its own name but for the account of the secured parties pursuant to Article 5 of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law, respectively Article 3 of Book III, Chapter XVII ‘Security on movable assets’ of the (old) Belgian Civil Code. These provisions allow for the creation of security held by an agent acting as representative for secured parties, provided that the secured parties can be determined on the basis of the security agreement. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

However, with respect to a pledge over cash on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. During judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue (in principle) to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint, a company mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/ _médiateur d’entreprise) to assist the debtor during the moratorium and to facilitate the reorganization of the_ company or of all or part of its assets or activities. The court may also appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, to exercise particular tasks indicated by the court. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislator has amended the law in such way that the same measure can also be requested by the debtor, in case of shortcomings or if the debtor can no longer be managed properly. In principle and if not extended, this amendment applies only until 1 April 2023. In the event of manifestly gross error of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies, the court may appoint a temporary administrator (voorlopige _bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire), upon the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor,_ replacing the debtor’s corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium. Furthermore, upon request of any interested party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company loses all or part of the management of all or part of its assets or activities in case of important, precise and consistent indications (gewichtige, bepaalde en met elkaar overeenstemmende aanwijzigingen/indices _graves, précis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are met._ The delegated judge, appointed by the court to supervise the reorganization, as well as any interested party or the public prosecutor can request the court to end the reorganization procedure prematurely if the debtor is clearly no longer able to ensure the continuity of the whole or part of the business in accordance with the purpose of the reorganization or where the information provided to the delegated judge, to the court or to the creditors at the time the petition is filed or subsequently is manifestly incomplete or incorrect. ----- The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to closeout netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Law or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract (other than labor contracts) during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and that such default is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise of this right does however not prevent the creditor from suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations. _Judicial reorganization by collective agreement, by amicable settlement or by court ordered transfer of enterprise_ Judicial reorganization proceedings may result in an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors, a collective agreement or a transfer of (part of) its activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and all parties involved. In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. In the event of a later bankruptcy, certain claw-back provisions are not applicable to an amicable settlement nor to the acts performed in execution thereof. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it. In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity (the Belgian Insolvency Law contains certain limitations, primarily in view of protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. It must be filed with the online insolvency register (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote. The reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees, mortgagees and the so-called creditor-owners, provided that (i) interest is paid on the principal amount of their outstanding debts, and (ii) their rights are not suspended for more than 24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by the court. No other measures can be imposed on such creditors without their individual agreement. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities of the law were not met, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy. Within a period of eight days following the judgment opening the judicial reorganization proceedings, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of the capacity of the creditor as extraordinary creditor and of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor at the latest one month prior to the day on which the creditors vote on the reorganization plan. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure, or definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction in that respect ----- but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame. In addition, the court can at any moment, in the event of absolute necessity and upon the request of the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court appointed judicial administrator or company mediator, as the case may be. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It may also be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The court-ordered transfer will be organized by one or more judicial administrators (gerechtsmandataris/ _mandataire de justice). Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will in most cases be limited to the_ transfer price. It is also possible for the debtor to apply for a “pre-packaged insolvency” (voorbereidend akkoord/accord _préparatoire) (the “Pre-Pack”) procedure, where the debtor may discretely prepare for judicial reorganization_ proceedings under the supervision of a judicial administrator. These measures were initially adopted for a limited period ending on 30 June 2021. Pursuant to the Royal Decree of 12 July 2022 extending articles 2, and 4 to, and including, 12 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law and the Income Tax Code of 1992, those measures were extended until 31 March 2023. The purpose of the Pre-Pack is to confidentially test the possibility of an amicable or collective arrangement with a debtor’s most important creditors prior to formal reorganization proceedings. This occurs during a Pre-pack phase, i.e., a court supervised preparatory negotiation phase. If the negotiations in this Pre-pack phase are successful, the Pre-pack phase will be converted into the formal judicial reorganization proceedings (aimed at obtaining either an amicable agreement with two or more creditors, or a collective reorganization agreement that is approved by the majority of creditors representing the majority of the claims and binding on dissenting creditors). The Pre-pack consists of the following features. A debtor may initiate the Pre-pack procedure by filing a petition with the President of the competent enterprise court, substantiating that its continuity is at risk immediately or in the short term. To ensure confidentiality, the petition is “unilateral” (meaning that creditors are not summoned to share their views on the petition) and will be decided upon by the President in a hearing behind closed doors (held within 8 days from the date of the petition). The subsequent decision of the President is not published in the Belgian Official Gazette. Opposition is not possible. If the President decides to refuse the Pre-pack petition, the debtor may appeal such decision within 8 days after being notified of that decision. If the President decides to approve the Pre-pack petition, the President will appoint a judicial administrator. After the appointment of the judicial administrator (which is not published), the debtor must produce a list of creditors and disclose such list to the judicial administrator. The judicial administrator will subsequently assist the debtor in negotiating an amicable agreement, or a collective restructuring plan with either all or some of the creditors. During the Pre-pack phase, the debtor remains in control and may terminate the Pre-pack procedure at any time. If the negotiations conducted by the judicial administrator are successful, he can request the President of the enterprise court to refer the matter to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court for the formal opening of judicial reorganization proceedings. Subsequently, an amicable agreement might be sanctioned (“homologated”) by the court, or the collective restructuring plan might be put to the creditors’ vote. ----- Once referred, the judicial reorganization proceedings are carried out in an expedited manner. Within 5 business days after referral, the enterprise court will initiate formal judicial reorganization proceedings. In the event of an amicable agreement, the enterprise court will decide on confirming or rejecting the amicable settlement within one month. In the event of a collective restructuring agreement, court will schedule a hearing within 3 months after the opening of the formal judicial reorganization proceedings during which hearing the creditors will vote on the restructuring plan. At the request of the judicial administrator, during the Pre-pack procedure, the President of the enterprise court may subject creditors to payment terms and/or payment conditions as well as stay enforcement measures for a maximum period of four months. As soon as the matter is referred to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court, the debtor-company will enjoy the full suspension period (moratorium) offered by the formal judicial reorganization proceedings (i.e., during which enforcement measures against the company’s assets—for debts incurred before the opening of the judicial reorganisation proceedings—will be suspended).",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding second bullet point, their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.1,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,62.1.2,Stated Interest on the Notes,"A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of such payment but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, a U.S. holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within such U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, a U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate such accrued interest at the spot exchange rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the last day of the partial accrual period within each respective taxable year), or at the spot exchange rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference, if any, between: (i) the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot exchange rate on the date the payment is received, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as from sources within the United States and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. If any additional amounts are paid on the Notes to “gross up” in respect of withholding or deduction for taxes (see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), such amounts will be includible in a U.S. holder’s income as ordinary interest income at the time such amount is received or accrued in accordance with such holder’s method of tax accounting. For foreign tax credit purposes, interest income on the Notes (including any additional amounts and OID, if any) will be treated as ordinary income from sources without the United States and generally will be treated as “passive category income.” If any non-U.S. taxes were to be paid or ----- withheld in respect of payments on the Notes, a U.S. holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations (including holding period, at risk requirements, and under recent U.S. regulations, requirements that a “covered withholding tax”be imposed on nonresidents in lieu of a generally applicable tax that satisfies the regulatory definition of an “income tax,”which may be unclear or difficult to determine), for a foreign tax credit. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.1,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,62.1.3,Original Issue Discount,"The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount exceeds the issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). If the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price”at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the OID includible in income for each prior accrual period and decreased by payments previously made on the Note other than stated interest. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Notes as of the issue date. For foreign tax credit purposes, OID will be treated as ordinary income from sources without the United States and generally will be treated as “passive category income.”OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods applicable to stated interest payable to accrual basis U.S. holders, as described above in the second paragraph under “—Stated Interest on the Notes.” A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, determined in the same manner as exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest as described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than ----- amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid interest and OID, if any, which will be includible in income as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described under “—Stated Interest on the Notes” or “—Original Issue Discount”) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot exchange rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (and if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of that amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes this election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make this election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates (including with respect to accrued stated interest and accrued OID, if any) will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid interest and OID, if any (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Stated Interest on the Notes” or “—Original Issue _Discount”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale,_ exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income or loss generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. In the case of a U.S. holder that is a non-corporate taxpayer (including individuals), net long term capital gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates compared to items of ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Debt instruments issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the U.S. Federal Register, such as the Notes, generally would be “grandfathered” and not subject to withholding on “foreign passthru payments” unless materially modified in a way that such obligations are treated as exchanged for new obligations for U.S. federal income tax purposes after such date. To date, no such regulations have been issued. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the U.S. Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders of the Notes should consult their tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes.

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a “U.S. holder”(as defined below) (except with respect to the potential application of FATCA (as defined below) to holders that are not U.S. holders, discussed below under “—Foreign Account _Tax Compliance Act”). This discussion does not address the impact of any U.S. federal tax laws other than_ U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws), any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or the Medicare tax on certain net investment income. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders who elect to mark their investment to market, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (including foreign branches) or investors in such entities or arrangements, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, accrual method taxpayers who are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is taken into account in applicable financial statements (as defined in Section 451(b) of the Code), and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,”“hedge,”“conversion transaction,”“constructive sale”or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (in this case, the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity classified as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons” (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a “United States person” (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code). If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, the fiduciary of a Plan should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws, including, without limitation, general fiduciary requirements of ERISA, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification, the requirement that a Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the Plan, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed under “Risk Factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the Notes. Governmental plans, certain church plans, non-U.S. plans and other plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan who engaged in such non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if the Notes are acquired with the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Agents, the Trustee, the lenders under the Senior Facility or any of their respective affiliates is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of ERISA Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset managers) (“Investor**Based Exemptions”).

However, there can ----- be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions or the Service Provider Exemption or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. Any insurance company proposing to invest assets of its general account in the Notes should consider the extent to which such investment would be subject to the requirements of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.

Until 40 days following the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of Notes sold within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S. Each purchaser of the Notes will, by its purchase, be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth “Notice to Investors.” Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. ----- No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Canada, France, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Singapore and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Important Information” and “Notice to Investors.” The Issuer has agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issuance of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Important _Information” and “Notice to Investors.” Application is expected to be made to the Authority for the listing of_ and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time without notice in their sole discretion. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market will develop for the Notes, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_ In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering (which involves sales in excess of the offering size), creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in marketmaking transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and may also impose penalty bids (which permit the Stabilizing Manager to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions). These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financing Arrangements and the Notes—There may _not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the Issue Date and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the Issue Date, which will be five business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes. This settlement cycle is referred to as “T+5.” Under Rule 15c6-1 of ----- the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following two business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

913_2,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,France,23.1.1,,"The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws and which is enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered in the United States could initiate recognition and enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Recognition and enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non _ex parte) proceedings if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which_ conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having “indirect”jurisdiction over the matter as this concept is defined by French courts in the context of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, meaning that the dispute was clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court, the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules (ordre public international), both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fundamental procedural rights; - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law; and - in addition, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res _judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict_ with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. The decision granting the exequatur can be appealed before the Court of Appeals. ----- In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French criminal law no. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities) and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (adapting the value in euros of certain amounts expressed in francs in legislative texts), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts) or in case of overriding mandatory rules. Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with a French person. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by a jurisdiction provision in a contract or by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU member state. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. There still is doubt under French law as to the validity of one-sided jurisdiction clauses, i.e., contractual provisions submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party an additional option to choose another jurisdiction. The civil chamber of the French High Court (Cour de cassation), further to several decisions, considers that such clauses do not comply with the objective of foreseeability set out in applicable international instruments unless the competent courts can be identified by reference to objective elements or jurisdiction rules. Accordingly, any one-sided jurisdiction clauses which do not set out an objective basis (as a reference to a ground of jurisdiction or to legal rules) in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. These decisions were issued on the basis of the Brussels Regulation or on the basis of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters signed in Lugano on October 30, 2007 and have yet to be confirmed in cases that fall outside this scope. On the other hand, the Commercial Chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held that a unilateral jurisdiction clause was valid in a decision issued on May 11, 2017. Accordingly, case-law regarding the validity of unilateral jurisdiction clauses can be regarded as uncertain. Any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents may not be binding over the courts chosen by the parties. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

In particular, the court rendering the judgment must not have infringed an exclusive ground of jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law. - The judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy (orden público) or any mandatory provision, and the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in Spain. - The documentation prepared for the purpose of requesting the enforcement of the judgment is accompanied by an original, authentic, translation into Spanish, unless there is a discrepancy, in which case an official translation would be required. - The copy of the judgment presented before the Spanish court is duly apostilled. - There is no ongoing proceedings between the same parties and in relation to the same subject in Spain initiated before a Spanish court before beginning the proceedings before the foreign court. - There is no incompatible judgment rendered in Spain or previously rendered in another country that meets the requirements to be enforceable in Spain. - The rights of defense of any of the parties were not breached (including, but not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to prepare its defense and the judgment was not rendered by default (i.e., without appearance or without the possibility for the defendant to appear)). - Although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proved that the US jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish courts on a general basis, then the Spanish courts could be compelled to deny the recognition of the US judgment in Spain. The Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters specifically prohibits a foreign judgment from being reviewed on the merits (revisión sobre el fondo) by the Spanish competent court. The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party wishing to have a US ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the US resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish judge of first instance court (Juzgado _de Primera Instancia) or commercial court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil)._ The competence to hear applications for recognition and authorization for enforcement of foreign judgments in Spain corresponds to the trial courts of the domicile of the party against which the recognition or enforcement is sought, or of the person who referred to the effects of the foreign judgment. Secondarily, the territorial jurisdiction shall be determined by the place of execution or the place in which resolution should produce its effects, being competent, in the latter case, the Court of First Instance before which stands the application for recognition. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the US could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from Spanish persons in connection with a judicial or administrative US action. ----- Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and payable by the issuer or Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be paid in euros. The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs: (i) translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish; (ii) certain professional fees for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain, if necessary; (iii) judicial tax and fees; (iv) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (v) the content and validity of foreign law must be evidenced to the Spanish courts. Also, please note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail regardless of any provision to the contrary in the Notes or any other agreement. Once a judgment has been recognized under the exequatur procedure, it will be enforceable in Spain in accordance with the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil); in particular, the deadline for filing enforcement requests will be applicable (5 years). If an original action is brought in Spain, Spanish courts may refuse to apply the designated law if its application contravenes Spanish public policy (orden público) or it may not grant enforcement in the event that they deem that a right has been exercised in such a manner to constitute an abuse of right (abuso de _derecho)._",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

In the absence of any applicable bilateral or multilateral treaty, final and enforceable judgments rendered by foreign courts can be declared enforceable in Belgium (without review of the foreign judgment on the merits by the Belgian courts) according to the procedure set out in Articles 22 and sq. of the Belgian Code of International Private Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé) and provided that, pursuant to Article 24 of the same Code, the following documents are produced in court by the claimant seeking enforcement: - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law; - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstrating that the judgment was served or notified to the party that did not appear; and - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been notified to the defendant. However, enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of International Private Law and notably (and, inter alia), if: - such enforcement would be manifestly contrary to Belgian public policy; - the rights of defense have been violated; - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian private international law; - the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement could then be granted); - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium; - the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and relating to the same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court; - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets without any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state; ----- - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to _inter alia insolvency proceedings or corporate standing; or_ - the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim. Note that, in accordance with Article 25, §2 of the Belgian Code of International Private Law, Belgian courts will not carry out a review on the merits of the foreign judgment for which enforcement is sought. As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). In Belgium, the procedural rules set out in, among others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of Private International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by foreign courts is sought in Belgium. In the case of an enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of foreign court decisions in Belgium), a registration tax at the rate of 3% (to be calculated on the total amount, which a debtor is ordered to pay) is payable by the debtor, if the sum of money that the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court judgment, or by a foreign court judgment that is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds €12,500. The debtors are liable for the payment of the registration tax, in the same proportion as the one according to which the sums of money of which payment has been ordered, are payable by each of them. The debtors are jointly and severally liable in the event that they are ordered to pay jointly and severally. In general, documentary duties are due on deeds and certificates issued by Belgian officials (notaries, bailiffs and clerks) and banking institutions, ranging from EUR 0.15 to EUR 100, provided that such deeds and certificates are drawn up or executed in Belgium. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS** Post-employment benefits mainly concern retirement benefits in France. In accordance with the revised IAS 19 standard, legal and contractual indemnities are provisioned for each of the employees present according to their theoretical seniority on the day of their retirement. Pension commitments were updated during the first half year to take into account, on the one hand, the increase in the discount rate and, on the other hand, the modification of the Syntec national collective agreement. With the exception of these two elements, the assumptions used to determine these postemployment benefits are identical to those used at the end of the financial year ended December 31, 2021. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

These include the costs incurred to allow employees to continue their professional activities by teleworking and the costs incurred for the purchase of masks, gels, etc. - Subsidies received from the state and deferral of payment of social charges The partial activity measures put in place because of the pandemic have enabled the Group to benefit from government aid. These compensatory allowances received, 11.6 million euros, have been recorded as a reduction in personnel costs. In addition, still as part of the support measures, the Group has benefited in France from a deferral of the payment of social charges, the amount of which amounts to approximately 19.8 million euros. - Estimates of accounting methods The accounting assumptions used by the Group for the preparation of the annual accounts have been revised to consider the impact of the pandemic. These include the valuation methods of provisions for customer depreciation, goodwill, rental contracts (assets and debts recognized under the application of IFRS 16) and the recoverability of deferred taxes. active. Trade receivables:** The analyzes of customer risks and the good collectability of trade receivables during fiscal year 2020 did not lead the Group to recognize statistical provisions as recommended by IFRS 9. Goodwill.** The Group considered that the consequences of this health crisis represent an indication of impairment losses. Thus, impairment tests were carried out to ensure that the recoverable values of the cashgenerating units are not lower than their net book values. In addition, the discount rates used consider the additional premium related to Covid-19. Lease contracts.** The rent payment arrangements granted by lessors due to the Covid-19 pandemic did not significantly impact the value of debt and assets recognized under lease contracts. Assessment of deferred tax assets.** The analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to tax losses was tested on the basis of new assumptions. This analysis leads the Group not to question the future consumption of these deferred tax assets recognized. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS** These plans relate to post-employment benefits and are characterized by an obligation on the part of the employer to its employees. In this regard, the Group recognizes a debt corresponding to the present value of estimated future payments by retaining internal and external parameters. The valuation of the Group’s commitments under these plans are valued annually by independent actuaries using the “projected unit credit” method. Per this method, each period of service gives rise to the recognition of an additional unit of benefit rights and each of these units is assessed separately to obtain the final obligation. This method is also based on considering hypotheses of mortality, staff turnover and projection of future salaries. The commitments calculated in this way are discounted based on the interest rates on long-term bonds of first-class issuers. Expenses related to these plans are recognized in the income statement based on contributions paid or due for the year in which the related services were rendered by the beneficiaries. Any revisions to the calculation assumptions (actuarial assumptions or the effect of experience—differences between the actuarial projection and the reality at the date of preparation of the consolidated accounts) generate actuarial gains and losses. These actuarial differences are recognized, during the period in which they arise, in equity under the heading “Gains and losses recorded in equity”. For the Group, post-employment benefits mainly concern end-of-career indemnities in France. In accordance with the revised IAS 19 standard, legal and contractual indemnities are provisioned for each of the employees present per their theoretical length of service on the day of their retirement. These commitments are determined with an initial assumption at the initiative of the employee in 100% of cases and consider the following elements: - Average turnover rate is determined by entity on the basis of resignations observed over a period of 3 years - Average rate of social charges applied: 47%; - Average salary increase rate of is calculated by age and category; - INSEE 2015 – 2017 mortality tables by sex; - Discount rate at 0.78% (versus 0.54% at the end of 2020) and an estimated duration of the plan of 11.2 years. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS** These plans relate to post-employment benefits and are characterized by an obligation on the part of the employer to its employees. In this regard, the Group recognizes a debt corresponding to the present value of estimated future payments by retaining internal and external parameters. The valuation of the Group’s commitments under these plans are valued annually by independent actuaries using the “projected unit credit” method. Per this method, each period of service gives rise to the recognition of an additional unit of benefit rights and each of these units is assessed separately to obtain the final obligation. This method is also based on considering hypotheses of mortality, staff turnover and projection of future salaries. The commitments calculated in this way are discounted based on the interest rates on long-term bonds of first-class issuers. Expenses related to these plans are recognized in the income statement based on contributions paid or due for the year in which the related services were rendered by the beneficiaries. Any revisions to the calculation assumptions (actuarial assumptions or the effect of experience—differences between the actuarial projection and the reality at the date of preparation of the consolidated accounts) generate actuarial gains and losses. These actuarial differences are recognized, during the period in which they arise, in equity under the heading “Gains and losses recorded in equity”. For the Group, post-employment benefits mainly concern end-of-career indemnities in France. In accordance with the revised IAS 19 standard, legal and contractual indemnities are provisioned for each of the employees -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

GOODWILL",1907.16.1,,"Goodwill corresponds to the difference between the purchase price (increased, where applicable, by non-controlling interests) and the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the context of an acquisition of less than 100% (giving control but with existence of minority interests), the Group may choose to apply the “full goodwill” or “partial goodwill” calculation method. The “full goodwill” method assumes that all the revalued net assets, including the share of minority interests, are included in the calculation of goodwill. The unearned fraction is then valued either at fair value or at the amount of its share in the reassessed equity. The “partial goodwill” method, for its part, assumes to be retained in the calculation only the acquired share of the revalued net assets. When the calculation of the goodwill results in a negative difference (case of an acquisition carried out under advantageous conditions), the negative goodwill thus recorded is immediately recognized in profit or loss under “Other operating income and expenses”. Price adjustments are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date and therefore included in the calculation of goodwill. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3, their subsequent variations give rise, in the period of 12 months following the acquisition date, to a modification of goodwill. Beyond this period, they are recognized in profit or loss. Goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Units likely to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which they are monitored for internal management needs. In addition, they are not amortized but are subject to an impairment test at least once a year under the conditions described in Note 8.3 “Cash generating units and impairment tests”",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

GOODWILL",1907.34.1,,"Goodwill corresponds to the difference between the purchase price (increased, where applicable, by non-controlling interests) and the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the context of an acquisition of less than 100% (giving control but with existence of minority interests), the Group may choose to apply the “full goodwill” or “partial goodwill” calculation method. The “full goodwill” method assumes that all the revalued net assets, including the share of minority interests, are included in the calculation of goodwill. The unearned fraction is then valued either at fair value or at the amount of its share in the reassessed equity. The “partial goodwill” method, for its part, assumes to be retained in the calculation only the acquired share of the revalued net assets. When the calculation of the goodwill results in a negative difference (case of an acquisition carried out under advantageous conditions), the negative goodwill thus recorded is immediately recognized in profit or loss under “Other operating income and expenses”. Price adjustments are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date and therefore included in the calculation of goodwill. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3, their subsequent variations give rise, in the period of 12 months following the acquisition date, to a modification of goodwill. Beyond this period, they are recognized in profit or loss. Goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Units likely to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which they are monitored for internal management needs. In addition, they are not amortized but are subject to an impairment test at least once a year under the conditions described in Note 8.3 “Cash generating units and impairment tests”",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

Development costs that do not meet the activation criteria defined by IAS 38 are recognized in current operating expenses, as and when they are incurred. These development costs are amortized from the date of internal “acceptance”of the project, over the expected useful life of the software packages, which is capped at eight years. Research and development costs are assessed annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances, internal or external, indicate that a reduction in value may have occurred. The balance sheet value of activated development costs is compared to the recoverable value. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Value in use is determined by the discounted future cash flow (DCF) method, based on operating budgets for the coming year and forecasted sales for the next four years.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS PLAN** In the case of defined benefit plans covering post-employment benefits, the costs of these benefits are estimated using the projected unit credit method. The projected unit credit sees each period of service as giving rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement applying the plan’s vesting formula, taking into account the linearization effect when the rights do not vest uniformly over subsequent vesting periods. Future payments corresponding to the benefits granted to employees are determined using various assumptions (rate of increase in salaries, retirement age, mortality, etc.) and these defined benefit obligations are then discounted to their present value using as discount rate the market yields on high quality corporate bonds. When assumptions are revised, this results in actuarial differences that are recognised in the period in which they arise, not to profit or loss but directly to equity under “Recognised income and expense”. Pursuant to the French pension reform act, the minimum legal age of retirement will increase gradually, by four months per year, from 60 in 2010 to 62 in 2019.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to cover itself against the risks associated with interest-rate variations. These derivative financial instruments are initially entered into the accounts at their fair value at the time when the contract is negotiated and later valued at their fair value. The derivatives are entered into the accounts as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The profits or losses resulting from the variations in the market value of hedge instruments, taken out to hedge future cash flows and for which the Group chose to apply hedge accounting, are recorded as equity capital at the hedge effectiveness percentage. When the Group chose not to apply hedge accounting, the profits or losses resulting from the variations in market value were entered into the income statement. Current financial liabilities correspond to hedging instruments recognised at fair value. Some interest-rate hedging instruments are for a constant amount until maturity, whereas others are for amounts that decline gradually until maturity. These hedging instruments are valued in accordance with IFRS 7 revised, Level II, i.e. based on observable data other than a price listed on an active market.

In particular, the balance sheet value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable value. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value net of disposal costs and the value in use. In order to determine their value in use, fixed assets to which it is not possible to directly attach independent cash flows are grouped together within the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which they belong. The CGUs correspond to homogeneous sets generating identifiable cash flows. The value in use of the CGU is determined by the discounted future cash flow (DCF) method according to the following principles: - the cash flows come from the operating budgets adopted by the Management for the coming financial year with forecasts of changes in turnover, operating margins and WCR levels for the following four years; - the combination of the discount rate and the infinity growth rate is in line with the values usually used in the sector for groups of comparable profile; -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565

In late January 2020, the first cases of coronavirus infection were detected in France. The Gfi group is following the evolution of this epidemic very closely in order to put in place all the appropriate actions to, as a priority, protect the health of its employees, customers and all third parties working with the Group, but also reduce the impacts as much as possible economic aspects of this epidemic. A dedicated crisis management unit has been set up at Group level and remains in communication ongoing with the various Group entities to assess the situation and take appropriate measures. The impacts linked to the COVID-19 epidemic on Gfi’s activities, at this stage are still too uncertain for the Group to be able to communicate on quantified forecasts. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,565
