(B) a non-U.S. person outside the United States and the e-mail address that you gave us and to which

Columbia; and

(3) if you are a resident in a Member State of the EEA, you are not an “EEA retail investor.” For the purposes
of this paragraph (3), the expression “EEA retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of:

(A) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 (as amended,
“MiFID II”); or

(B) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance

(B) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(as amended, “FSMA”) and any rules and regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of United
Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(C) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes offered under the Offering
Memorandum will be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act
pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers
is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers
or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the Offering
Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these
securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently the Initial Purchasers, or any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, or any of their respective


-----

directors, officers, employees or agents or affiliates of any such person accepts any liability or responsibility
whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format
and the hard copy version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers. If you receive this document by
e-mail, you should not reply by e-mail to this announcement. Any reply e-mail communications, including those
you generated by using the “reply” function on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive
this document by e-mail, your use of this e-mail is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions
to ensure that it is free from viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

Any securities to be issued will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of,
U.S. persons (as such terms are defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the expiration of a 40-day distribution compliance period (as defined under Regulation S under
the Securities Act) commencing on the issue date, the securities may not be offered or sold in the United States or
to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except pursuant to another exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in a member state of the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (b)
a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as
a “professional client” as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (c) not a “qualified investor” as
defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “EU
**PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in**
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the
EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in each member state of the EEA. No prospectus
has been prepared in accordance with the EU Prospectus Regulation for this issue of Notes.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparty only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the EEA
in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market
for the Notes is professional clients and eligible counterparties only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (b) a customer within the
meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (c) not a qualified
investor as defined in the U.K. Prospectus Regulation, and the expression an offer includes the communication in
any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to
enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.


-----

Consequently, no key information document required by the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United Kingdom will be
made pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus
Regulation.

**U.K. product governance / professional client and eligible counterparty only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the
United Kingdom in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i)
the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the Financial Conduct Authority
(“FCA”) Handbook of Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“U.K. MiFIR”); and (ii)
all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “U.K. MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Offering Memorandum is not being distributed by, nor has it been approved for the purposes of Section 21
of FSMA by, an authorized person in the United Kingdom under FSMA. In the United Kingdom, the Offering
Memorandum and any other material in relation to the Notes described therein are being distributed only to, and
are directed only at, persons who are not “retail investors” (as defined above) and who are (i) persons having
professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”), and persons falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Order, (iii) persons
outside the United Kingdom or (iv) persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise
lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant
**Persons”). The Notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or**
otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only with, Relevant Persons. The attached Offering Memorandum
and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or
disclosed by any recipients to any other person in the United Kingdom who is not a Relevant Person. Any person
in the United Kingdom that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the attached Offering Memorandum
or its contents.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the
Notes other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Company (as defined
herein).

**Preliminary Offering Memorandum** **Strictly Confidential**

**Not for General Distribution**

**in The United States of America**

## PrestigeBidCo GmbH


_Guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of PrestigeBidCo GmbH_


**€550,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2029**

PrestigeBidCo GmbH, a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) incorporated and existing under the laws of Germany (the
“Issuer”), is offering €550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Issuer is an entity
beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds (as defined herein).

The Notes will mature on,       , 2029. The Issuer will pay interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Notes at a per annum rate equal to three-month
EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus %, reset quarterly. Interest will be paid on the Notes quarterly in arrears on

each       ,       ,        and       , commencing on      , 2024. At any time on or after       , 2025, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all
or a portion of the Notes at par. At any time prior to       , 2025, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus the applicable
“make whole” premium as described in this offering memorandum (this “Offering Memorandum”). Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change
of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred if the Issuer’s consolidated net leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels at the time of such event. See “Description of the Notes.” In addition,
the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.

The Notes will be the Issuer’s general, senior obligations and will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that
are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as defined herein), certain
cash management obligations (including supply chain financing), if any, and certain hedging obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any existing and
future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, if any. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the
“Note Guarantees” and each, a “Note Guarantee”) by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (each a “Guarantor” and together, the “Guarantors”). The Note
Guarantee issued by each Guarantor will rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that are not expressly_
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (including indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations)
and rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note
Guarantee, if any.

On or about the Issue Date, and in any case within 30 days, the Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with first-ranking security interests (the “Collateral”)
over substantially the same assets that secure the Revolving Credit Facility subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles (as defined therein), as more
fully described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Note Guarantees and the security interests will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and
may be released under certain circumstances. The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured debt of the
Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets which do not secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and
assets securing such debt. The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the
limitations described in “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

This Offering Memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and the Note Guarantees, including redemption and purchase prices, security, covenants
and transfer restrictions.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the Notes
will be listed on the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Settlement of the Notes is not
conditional on such admission. The Exchange is a market designated for professional investors. The Authority has not approved or verified the contents of this
Offering Memorandum. The Exchange is not a regulated market for purposes of MiFID II.


**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 24.**

**Price for the Notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**


We expect that the Notes will be delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) on
or about      , 2024 (the “Issue Date”).

**The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities**
**Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes and the Note Guarantees are being offered and sold in the United States only to**
**qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)**
**and to persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers that are QIBs**
**are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be relying on the exemption from the registration requirements under the**
**U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions” for additional information about eligible**
**offerees and transfer restrictions.**

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase any
of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is
unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in
any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and this Offering Memorandum may not be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in
accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws that apply
to you in any place in which you buy, offer or sell any Notes or possess this Offering Memorandum. You must

should be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the Initial Purchasers, the trustee, or any other agents
acting with respect to the Notes as to the past or the future.

By receiving this Offering Memorandum, you acknowledge that you have not relied on the Initial Purchasers or
their respective directors, affiliates, agents or advisors in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of
this information or your decision whether to invest in the Notes. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to
have acknowledged that you have reviewed this Offering Memorandum and have had an opportunity to request,
and have received, all additional information that you need from us. No person is authorized in connection with
any offering made by this Offering Memorandum to give any information or to make any representation not
contained in this Offering Memorandum or any pricing term sheet or supplement and, if given or made, any other

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of
certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all statements
other than statements of historical facts contained in this Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation,
those regarding our future financial position and results of operations, our strategy, plans, objectives, goals and
targets, future developments in the markets in which we participate or are seeking to participate, or anticipated
regulatory changes in the markets in which we operate or intend to operate. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projected,”
“should,” or “will” or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution
you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous
assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the
development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those
made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition,
even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering
Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent
periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not
limited to:

attractive products from various popular brands at attractive prices that will satisfy our customers’

growth and activity on mobile devices depends upon effective use of mobile operating systems, networks,
and standards that the business does not control;

  - failure of the business to adopt new technologies or adapt its websites, mobile app and systems to
changing customers’ requirements or emerging industry standards could materially and adversely affect

credit exposure to the business;

- the business might be exposed to tax risks or tax liabilities resulting from adverse amendments to current
legislation, including developments in the tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce in the
jurisdictions in which the business operates, that could adversely affect the commercial use of the

the company’s systems, and the company could be subject to litigation if third parties challenge its rights
to use such software on an exclusive basis;

  - the company is subject to customs and international trade laws that could require it to modify its current
business practices and incur increased costs or could result in a delay in getting products through customs
and port operations, which may limit growth and cause reputational damage;

  - the business uses standardized sales agreements, as well as standardized terms and conditions, and plans
to implement standardized purchase and supply agreements, which increase the potential that all contract
terms used therein may be invalid or unenforceable if any clause is held to be void;

  - the company’s forward-looking information included in this Offering Memorandum should be carefully
considered and may materially differ from actual results;

  - other risks associated with the Transactions, our financial profile, the Notes, our structure and the
financing; and

  - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other
sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to
predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements.

more detailed discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the markets in which we

Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. In addition,
from time to time we and our representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may
make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but
are not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other

reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statements or risk factors,
whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent written and
oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

The historical financial information included and presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Issuer and
its consolidated subsidiaries. In particular, this Offering Memorandum includes and presents:

  - the English-language translation of the original German-language audited consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Audited
**Consolidated Financial Statements”), December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Audited Consolidated**
**Financial Statements”) and December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Audited Consolidated Financial**
**Statements”, and together with the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2022**
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Audited **Consolidated Financial Statements”), in**
each case, including the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e para. 1 of the HGB; and

  - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the three
months ended March 31, 2024, including the notes thereto (the “Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
**Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the**
“Consolidated **Financial Statements”) which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS on interim**
financial reporting (IAS 34).

The German-language versions of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by EY GmbH
& Co. KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (formerly Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft)
(“EY”), in accordance with Section 317 of the HGB, and German generally accepted standards for financial
statements audits promulgated by the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW).

The financial information marked as “audited” in the tables included in this Offering Memorandum is taken from
the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial information marked as “unaudited” in the tables
included in this Offering Memorandum is taken from the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements and the Issuer’s accounting systems or is based on calculations of figures from the abovementioned
sources.

**_Change in Accounting Policies and Presentation_**

In the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the Issuer changed the presentation of liabilities in
connection with its existing reverse factoring supply chain financing arrangements in the consolidated statement
of financial position. The liabilities from supply chain financing were reclassified from line item “trade and other
payables” to line item “other current financial liabilities” in order to improve the informative value of the
consolidated financial statements and increase comparability with other companies. The comparative figures as
of December 31, 2022 have been adjusted in the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements accordingly.
As a result, certain figures in the Group’s statement of financial position information as of December 31, 2022
presented in this Offering Memorandum have been taken from the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements. For more information see Note 5.13 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2024 Financial Information_**

The unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has been
calculated by adding the consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2024 derived
from the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements to the consolidated financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2023 derived from the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements and subtracting the consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2023,
derived from the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. The unaudited consolidated
financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has not been audited by any external auditors
and is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles
and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of
operations for such period or any future period or our financial condition at any past or future date and is not
prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting.


-----

**_Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2023 Financial Information_**

The unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 has been
calculated by adding the consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2023 derived
from the comparative column of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements to the
consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022 derived from the 2022 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and subtracting the consolidated financial information for the three months
ended March 31, 2022, derived from the Issuer’s accounting systems. The unaudited consolidated financial
information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 has not been audited by any external auditors and is not
required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for
such period or any future period or our financial condition at any past or future date and is not prepared in the
ordinary course of our financial reporting.

**_Financial Information for Other Periods_**

In this Offering Memorandum we present certain financial information related to periods prior to 2021. The
financial information for periods prior to 2021 has been presented herein for illustrative purposes only and
investors should place no reliance on such information. This Offering Memorandum does not include the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for any period prior to 2021. There can be no assurance that, had
such information been audited or reviewed, there would not have been any discrepancies (including material)
compared to the financial information presented herein. The financial information presented in this Offering
Memorandum for periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2021, may not be comparable to financial
information for later periods, due to changes to IFRS that have occurred over time.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS financial measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies, Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate
Cost Synergies Margin, Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital Expenditure, Operating Net Working
Capital, Operating Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion Before Run Rate Cost Synergies and certain leverage and
coverage ratios, among others, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Our non-IFRS
financial measures are defined by us as set out below.

We define “EBITDA” as net income/(net loss) for the period before income taxes, financial income, financial
expenses, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and the reversal of impairment losses, each as shown
in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies” as EBITDA adjusted for exceptional items
as described under “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Data”, before
run-rate cost synergies arising from fulfilment center network expansion.

We define “Run Rate **Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA adjusted for exceptional items as described under**
“Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Data” and run-rate cost synergies
arising from the fulfillment center network expansion.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA Before Run
Rate Cost Synergies divided by revenue.

We define “Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

We define “Capital Expenditure” as the sum of: (i) purchase of property, plant and equipment, (ii) purchase of
intangible assets and (iii) capitalized development costs each as shown in the consolidated statements of cash
flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We define “Operating **Net Working Capital” as the sum of (i) inventories and prepayments for inventories,**
(ii) trade and other receivables, (iii) trade and other payables and (iv) others. ‘Others’ includes refund liabilities
and assets for the right to recover possession of goods for expected returns as well as liabilities in connection with
its supply chain financing.

We define “Operating Free Cash Flow” as EBITDA plus the changes in net foreign exchange differences,
increase/decrease in other liabilities and provisions, decrease/increase in other assets, decrease/increase in trade

i


-----

and other receivables, decrease/increase in inventories and similar assets, increase/decrease in trade payables and
other liabilities each as shown in net cash flows from operating activities (changes in current assets, non-current
financial assets, current and non-current liabilities included in net cash flows from operating activities), minus
payment of lease liabilities as shown in net cash flows from financing activities and minus Capital Expenditure.

We define “Cash Conversion **Before Run Rate Cost Synergies” as the ratio between Operating Free Cash Flow**
and Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies.

There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or
that similar items will not be incurred in the future.

For a reconciliation of our net income/net loss for the period to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate
Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of Operating Free Cash Flow and
Cash Conversion Before Run Rate Cost Synergies, see “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information.” For a reconciliation and description of Capital Expenditure and Operating Net Working Capital, see_
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We present non-IFRS financial measures because we believe that they are widely used by certain investors,
securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental financial measures of performance and liquidity.
The non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures of other
companies and should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating
result as reported under IFRS. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as nonrecurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. Non-IFRS financial
measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to net income/ net loss for the period or any other performance financial measures
derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash
flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS financial measures may not give an accurate
or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented and should not be
relied upon when making an investment decision. The non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical
tools. Some of these limitations are:

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest
or principal payments, on our debts;

  - although amortization, depreciation and write-downs are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS financial
measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and

  - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run
Rate Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will be
made in the future.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA as used in this
Offering Memorandum are not calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA” is calculated pursuant
to the Indenture governing the Notes as described under “Description of the Notes” or for purposes of any of our
other indebtedness.

**Non-Financial Operating Data**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data, such as indexed customer growth
figures and cohort figures, GMV figures, NMV figures and active customers figures included in this Offering
Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our Consolidated Financial Statements or
financial accounting records, and have not been audited by outside auditors, consultants or experts. Our use or
computation of this data may not be comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported
by other companies. Any or all of this data should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of
performance under IFRS.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information presented in
millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been rounded according to established
commercial standards and, as a result, rounded figures in the tables included in this Offering Memorandum may
not add up to the aggregate amounts in such tables (sum totals or subtotals), which are calculated based on
unrounded figures. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other
information set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations” are calculated using the rounded numerical data included in this Offering Memorandum and not the_
numerical data in each of the Consolidated Financial Statements or Issuer’s accounting systems. With respect to
financial information set out in this Offering Memorandum, a dash (“—”) signifies that the relevant figure is not
available, while a zero (“0.0”) signifies that the relevant figure is available but is equal to or has been rounded to
zero.

accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC which would apply
if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

**SUMMARY**

**Overview**

We are one of Europe’s leading online destinations for premium and luxury off-price fashion. With a focus on
international premium and luxury brands, we offer our customers in 27 countries across Europe a standing
assortment of highly desirable fashion at exclusive prices in a premium shopping environment. At the same time,
we enable our brand partners to clear overstock at scale with minimum visibility and strong brand equity
protection. The success of our unique business model is based on its closed character with an invitation-only
customer membership, viral customer growth leading to unparalleled marketing efficiency, longstanding brand
partner and customer relationships, a tech-focused mindset, and its inherent contribution to more sustainability in
the fashion industry. We have a strong track record of profitable growth over many years. For the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated revenue of €942.9
million, €1,051.0 million, €1,226.0 million and €1,290.6 million, respectively, an Adjusted EBITDA Before Run
Rate Cost Synergies of €138.7 million, €132.5 million, €165.8 million and €183.0 million, respectively, and an
Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin of 14.7%, 12.6%, 13.5% and 14.2%, respectively.
Our revenue and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA grew from €1,077.8 million and €143.6 million, respectively, in
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 to €1,290.6 million and €200.9 million in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024, representing increases over 20% and 40%, respectively, over the same period. Our online revenue
accounted for 93.0%, 91.2%, 91.9% and 92.1% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022
and 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively (with a CAGR of 13.3% from the year ended
December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2023). While 59.0% of our revenue for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2024 (€762.0 million) was generated in Germany, our international business outside of Germany
continues to gain importance relative to our Germany business and experienced strong revenue growth from
€384.3 million (35.7% of revenue) in the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 to €528.5 million (41% of revenue)
in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, and from €267.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€489.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a CAGR of 35.2% over the same period.

**Strengths**

We believe that our business is characterized by a number of key strengths that set it apart from our competitors:

**_A European Leader in the Most Attractive, Resilient and Fastest Growing Fashion Segment_**

We focus on the fastest growing segment of the off-price fashion market, the online off-price fashion market, with
a European market size estimated at approximately €20 billion and projected to grow at a 10% CAGR through
2028, reaching approximately €31 billion (excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia). Additionally, we also
participate in the offline off-price market (which has a European market size estimated at approximately €29
billion excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia) through our four retail stores, two of which are located in Munich,
one in Vienna and one in Dresden. The total European off-price fashion market (comprised of the aforementioned
online and offline) has a size estimated at approximately €49 billion and is projected to grow at over a 6% CAGR
through 2028, reaching approximately €64 billion (excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia). Expansion in the
online off-price sector is mainly driven by three decisive market growth levers: a) growth in the overall size of
the European mid-to-luxury fashion market, which is anticipated to increase from €247 billion in 2023 to €293
billion in 2028, b) the expected growth of the off-price share in the European mid-market-to-luxury fashion
market, with penetration expected to increase from 20% in 2023 to 22% in 2028, and, most importantly, c) the
online penetration growth in the European off-price fashion market, which is expected to grow from 41% in 2023
to 49% in 2028. In addition to its growth potential, the off-price fashion market is characterized by its resilience
to the economic cycles due to premium and luxury consumers’ continued interest in finding good deals in fashion
across all economic environments, coupled with the difficulty for brands to accurately predict demand and an
overall incentive to over-produce. As a result, while consumer spend tends to decrease in the overall fashion
market in the context of economic downturns, the off-price fashion market thrives in recessions due to the
consumer spend shift to lower purchase prices available in the off-price fashion market. On the other hand, during
periods of strong overall fashion market performance, the off-price fashion market still shows robust growth
supported by overall market buoyancy. The following table compares the growth development of the overall
European fashion market to that of the off-price fashion submarket across several market downturns:

revenue growth estimated based on TJX international segments (excluding Homesense and Australia). Lounge by Zalando growth rates
included since reported in 2018.

We are a leading premium and luxury player in the European online off-price fashion market due to our strong
positioning in Germany as well as internationally. Furthermore, we are the only off-price fashion player with an
exclusive, invitation-only membership model. In 2021, our management decided to shift our strategy towards
accelerating our international growth in order to take advantage of the consolidation trend in the European online
off-price fashion market. This trend is illustrated by the growth in the share of the market captured by the top five
mid-to-luxury players, which has evolved from comprising 25% to 35% of the market in 2018 to comprising 30
to 40% of such market in 2023. This consolidation trend is still ongoing and is expected to continue evolving,
with a leading international strategy consultancy firm estimating that these players will capture 35% to 45% of
the market by 2028.

**_Superior Value Proposition Towards Brands and Customers, Resulting in a Brand and NMV Retention of_**
**_Approximately 100%_**

Our success is based on our deep and long-standing relationships with our brand partners and our customers. We
continue to grow our business alongside our top brands, having achieved double-digit growth across our top brand
tiers and more than doubled the NMV of our top 50 brands from 2019 to 2023. During the same period, we have
also realized a brand relationship retention rate of almost 100%. This achievement is based on our strong value
proposition towards brands, which are able to clear overstock at scale in a desirable environment with strong brand
equity protection. This results from a combination of a) the exclusivity of our platform (we have a members-only,
invitation-only model and periodically sift out inactive members to keep an engaged customer base), b) our ability
to block display of our brands’ off-price offerings outside of the closed membership base (with no Google listings
and no crawling through external websites and almost 100% of our products being sold in our own ecosystem)
and c) our ability to block access to our platform by deal platforms and the use of invalid invitation codes (for
example, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we block over one million of such non-member website
visit attempts per year. Our good relationships with our brand partners mean we are the “first call” for many of
our brand partners, resulting in access to large volumes of attractive overstock. We continue to work on making
our product selection attractive and recently implemented our elevation strategy (“Elevation Strategy”) pursuant
to which we seek to advance our value proposition and focus on highly desirable brands, resulting in higher appeal
for brand partners (which in turn enables the acquisition of additional luxury brand partners) and customers,
ultimately delivering higher profitability for BestSecret. As a result of our strategy, the proportion of our online
NMV in the “highly desirable” brand segment increased significantly between 2019 and 2023 as illustrated by the
following table:

Source: BestSecret.

(1) Differences to the 100% total might occur due to rounding of figures. High desirability is assessed in terms of desirability and/or scale.
Desirability assessment is based on a popularity index including, among other parameters, Instagram follower and Google search count
for brand listings on premium to luxury platforms (such as Breuninger and Mytheresa), as well as on an internal assessment carried out
by Best Secret’s supply team. Scale assessment is based on total brand NMV in Europe. Private label not included.

Our customers find us attractive for a host of reasons encompassing, among others, our superior brand portfolio,
our high-end environment, and our exclusive prices, which in our view combines the best aspects of both off-price
and full-price fashion: while we have a leading position with respect to the assortment of luxury brands compared
to our off-price peers (source: market report from international leading strategy consultancy firm, 2024) and our
standing assortment is ten-fold that of flash sales players, we offer 20% to 80% discounts on our items,
representing an approximately 30% price advantage when compared against the prices of full-price retailers. At
the same time, we maintain a full-price alike onsite experience, delivery times and customer service. Our Elevation
Strategy and the continuous advancement of our value proposition and focus on highly desirable brands further
increase the appeal of our platform to our customers. The success of our strategies can be evidenced by our online
customer growth between 2019 and 2024, which grew at a CAGR of over 20% with an average CSR of over 2%
(excluding the 2021 average, in which marketing spend was intentionally increased beyond 2%). In terms of yearon-year growth, the total number of active customers in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 grew by 28%, 21%,
58%, 14% and 16% from the prior year, respectively.

**_Unique Viral Growth Engine, Resulting in Unparalleled Marketing Efficiency_**

At the heart of our highly successful and unique business model is our viral customer growth model. Active
customers invite friends and family members, who then register on our platform and eventually become active
customers upon carrying out their first order. This ensures exponential customer growth at a minimal cost. We
have also implemented a complementary paid growth model pursuant to which we invite non-viral customers via
direct, one-on-one marketing efforts. We leverage this paid customer acquisition model to accelerate our customer
growth by planting new customer “seeds” in underpenetrated regions in Germany and our international markets.
While we only opportunistically invested into paid growth before 2021, we now systematically use targeted
performance marketing to pursue international growth. Nevertheless, viral growth remains our principal source of
new customers. Viral customers have historically accounted for the vast majority of our new customers and
continue to do so, with approximately 76% of our new customers in 2023 being viral new customers, despite our
customer inflow having more than doubled since 2019. Furthermore, although customers tend to invite most
during their first year as a member, resulting in higher viral rates (defined as the number of new online viral
customers in the last twelve months divided by the average number of active online customers in the last twelve
months), for markets with a high share of new customers, our viral growth remains strong after the first year across
the markets in which we operate, including our core market, Germany, where we have a viral rate of 22% despite
the market’s higher maturity. In our International markets, we have a viral rate of 38%.

Consistent viral customer generation in turn ensures high LTV to CAC ratios, with LTV defined as cumulative
PCII (gross margin minus fulfillment costs, including payments and customer care) per online customer since first
order, and CAC defined as total marketing expenses divided by total number of new customers, resulting in
approximately 20% customer growth despite low marketing investment. The following graph reflects the
LTV/CAC ratio for the 2019 and 2023 period and demonstrates that we are able to maintain short payback periods
on our marketing costs with steadily increasing trends:

Source: BestSecret.

(1) Lifetime value.

(2) Customer acquisition cost.

We are generally able to maintain low marketing spend due to our viral model and in particular, our strong viral
growth dynamics, which resulted in an average NMV retention of almost 100% between 2019 and 2023, at a
limited cost and a marketing spend approximately four times lower than that of our full-price, e-commerce peers
(2.8% versus 10.9%). Furthermore, our marketing spend, although limited, creates significant returns on
investment (“ROI”) as from 2019 to 2023, for each euro we spent on marketing, we generated €5.5 of incremental
revenue (compared to our full-price, e-commerce peers, which generated €1.2 of average revenue per euro spent).
This is primarily due to approximately 76% of our customers being acquired through our viral model with our
complementary paid marketing model only ramping up in more recently penetrated markets and target segments.

**_Strong Growth Avenues to Continue our Consistent Double-Digit Growth_**

We have strong avenues to ensure sustained double-digit growth and ongoing value creation, as shown by our
results in the German market, where our online NMV has grown at a CAGR of 17.5% between 2019 and 2023,
from €364 million in 2019 to €695 million in 2023, and our increased international reach, as shown by our
international online NMV, which has grown at an CAGR of over 54% between 2019 and 2023, from €83 million
in 2019 to €468 million in 2023. Additionally, our increased focus on the luxury segment shows another path for
continued growth, with our luxury online NMV share approximately doubling between 2019 and 2023, from
around 2% in 2019 to around 4% in 2023. Operational enhancements, such as our new fulfillment center in Poland,
are set to decrease warehousing costs per item, contributing to reduced cost-to-serve and improved PCII margins.
Although our warehousing cost per item has slightly increased from €1.83 to €1.90 between 2019 and 2023, we
expect this cost to substantially decrease by 2027. Furthermore, our technology investments in AI and automation
are poised to transform core operations, enabling scalable growth with a lean team. Overall, our growth and value
creation is supported by the Elevation Strategy.

In 2021, our management shifted our strategy to accelerate our international growth and reach market leadership
across Europe. Our international growth strategy has three steps: (1) developing a relevant brand portfolio tailored
to local customer preferences, (2) localizing the customer experience by providing local language websites,
payment methods, carriers and customer care, improving shipment costs and investing in marketing, particularly
social media, to generate new customers and (3) scaling our customer base and revenues through predominately
viral growth. Our strategy has been instrumental in driving consistent double-digit expansion and delivering strong
internalization growth as illustrated by the below tables:

Furthermore, our luxury initiative, which centers on enriching our portfolio with highly desirable luxury brands
by forging direct relationships with these brands already shows promising results. We have a clear plan to continue
acquiring luxury brands, which encompasses, from a business-to-business (B2B) standpoint, the opening of two
offices in major luxury fashion capitals, Paris and Milan, the hiring of over 10 new luxury fashion and buying
experts and the launch of our Curated Platform in 2023 (which enables selected partners to sell goods directly to
BestSecret’s closed customer community) and, from a business-to-client (B2C) standpoint, the enhancing of our
customers’ user experience through the introduction of a dedicated luxury section on our platform and an overall
high-end shopping experience. These initiatives have translated into more than 20 leading luxury and designer
brands won since we launched our Elevation Strategy and over 55% of direct brand relationships being converted
within six months after the first meeting in 2023. Additionally, we recorded over 85% luxury NMV growth in the
second half of 2023 and our average luxury selling price (as compared to total average selling price) is more than
three times higher (based on the average from 2019 to 2023). This results in an increase of our luxury online NMV
share from around 2% in 2019 to around 4% in 2023.

Our business model supports our objective to grow within the luxury sector as luxury brands need support in
clearing overstock while protecting their brand equity. The luxury market is a large market segment, with the
affordable luxury and luxury market amounting to approximately €68 billion, compared to the off-price affordable
luxury and luxury market, amounting to approximately €10 billion and representing 15% off-price penetration
such luxury market. However, luxury brands need long-term support from off-price players as these brands: a)
experience continuous growth of their impaired inventory, b) the expansion of their own offline outlets is
stagnating and c) these brands are increasingly facing barriers to impaired inventory destruction (for example, the
EU ban on destruction of unsold product). In this environment, we are well-positioned to assist through our
superior value proposition, and by being one of the largest clearance partners available with significant scaling
potential.

With the aim of supporting our strong business growth, we have successfully transformed our warehousing
infrastructure over the past years. By expanding our German fulfillment center and adding a new fulfillment center
in Poland in 2023, we expanded our inventory capacity from 7.9 million items in 2019 to 16.2 million items in
2023. Our inventory capacity is expected to further grow to around 30 million items by 2027 as we gradually
increase the level of automation. We estimate that our future inventory capacity will be able to serve an additional
NMV of three billion. Furthermore, the fulfillment center in Poland in 2023 offers significant labor cost
advantages (60% cost advantage per hour versus the Germany fulfillment center) and we expect the increasing
automation in such fulfillment center to drive further cost improvements going forward.

**_We Have A Highly Resilient Financial Profile_**

We have a resilient financial profile marked by strong performance across economic cycles. Despite facing
challenges affecting the worldwide economy and overall fashion market, such as the global financial crisis and
the COVID-19 pandemic, we have nevertheless preserved a strong market position, consistently delivering
double-digit revenue and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA growth (at a CAGR of 21.0% between 2019 and 2023).
We also have a strong cash flow generation and reinvest our cash to seek further future growth, as illustrated by
our recurring cash conversion, which averaged 50.0% in the period between 2019 and 2023 and was 61.0% in the
year ended December 31, 2023. Furthermore, our senior secured net leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of total
principal amount of senior secured net financial debt to LTM Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA) reduced from 1.6x as
of March 31, 2023 to 0.9x as of March 31, 2024. Our financial solidity, combined with a cautious leverage strategy
and our continued investment in strategic growth initiatives, position us for continued profitable growth.

The following chart demonstrates our continuous double-digit revenue growth and double-digit profitability.

principles (German GAAP) prior to 2016. Run Rate Cost Synergies from 2022 onwards. Figures above the bars represent total revenue
and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Group for the periods indicated.

**Strategy**

To build on our existing success, we have identified the following key elements of our strategy:

**_Expanding our footprint_**

Our strategic growth ambition hinges on expanding our presence, both in our core market, Germany, and
internationally. Although our business is subject to higher penetration in certain areas of Germany, we continue
to see opportunity for revenue growth within this market, which is supported by our almost 100% NMV retention,
robust customer loyalty and strong inflow of new customers. Furthermore, we recognize vast opportunities for
further international expansion. Our strategic approach to acceleration of international growth involves three steps:
(1) developing access to a relevant brand portfolio tailored to local customer preferences, (2) localizing the
customer experience by providing local language websites, payment methods, carriers and customer care,
improving shipment costs and investing in marketing, particularly social media, to generate new customers and
(3) as a final step, scaling our customer base and revenues through predominately viral growth.

**_Elevating our value proposition_**

Complementing our growth ambitions in the German and the International segments, is our luxury initiative,
which centers on enriching our portfolio with highly desirable luxury brands by forging direct relationships with
these brands. The launch of our luxury initiative in 2023 has had significant early success. As of the year ended
December 31, 2023, and since the launch of our Elevation Strategy, we have managed to win more than 20 leading
luxury and designer brands and our luxury fashion NMV experienced period-on-period growth in excess of 180%
for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our luxury initiative is part of our overarching Elevation Strategy,

6


-----

which focuses on growing the share of highly desirable brands in our portfolio - both in the luxury and premium
segments. By winning new brands and by expanding our business with existing brands in these segments, we aim
to continue to make our assortment more appealing.

As part of our Elevation Strategy, we also enhanced our online presence by introducing a new high-end design
for our app and online shop and by adding a dedicated luxury section, thereby aligning more closely with the
appeal of luxury brands. We also established offices in the renowned fashion capitals of Paris and Milan,
underlining our commitment to expanding our ongoing international activities, and being closer to our
international brand partners. Our Elevation Strategy not only strengthens our relationships with highly desirable
premium and luxury suppliers, but also bolsters our appeal to our customers. By deepening customer relationships
through compelling offers, we continue to foster a strong community of loyal members. With our commitment to
enriching our product assortment, elevating our online platform, and refining our shopping and service
experiences, we promote the retention of existing and acquisition of new customers and pave a way forward in
the online off-price fashion market.

**The Transactions**

We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering (i) to repay and redeem the Existing Notes on, or soon
after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date, (ii) to fund a distribution to the shareholder of the Issuer and (iii)
to pay certain fees and expenses in relation to the Transactions. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will deposit the net
proceeds from the Offering into the Depository Account. Pursuant to the terms of the Depository Agreement, such
deposited net proceeds will be released on, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in order to
consummate the Existing Notes Redemption whereas the residual amount following the Existing Notes
Redemption shall be transferred to the Issuer. We also intend to enter into the RCF Amendment and Restatement
Agreement on or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, and we expect the RCF Amendment and
Restatement Agreement to become effective on the Issue Date.

**Our History**

BestSecret draws on a heritage of 100 years in the textile industry. In 1924, Herman Schustermann founded a
textile company in Makredwitz, Germany and relocated to Munich in the late 1940s. In the early 1950s, Benno
Borenstein established his textile business in Munich. The two companies merged in 1960, and, after the death of
Herman Schustermann, a new cooperation was established with Herman’s son, Emil Schustermann, and Benno
Borenstein as partners. While Schustermann & Borenstein initially started as a combination of two textile trading
companies with regional customer bases around Munich, ready-to-wear clothes were added to the portfolio over
the next decades and the closed membership retail business model was born.

Prior to 2007, our business operations were limited to our Schustermann & Borenstein offline retail stores in
Munich. In 2007, we launched our BestSecret online platform. In 2011, we made the BestSecret online platform
available in the Austrian market, setting the first milestone for our international expansion strategy. Since then,
we have continued our online international expansion. Today, our multi-language online platform is available
across Europe with shipping available to 27 countries. We have continued to maintain a limited physical presence
with premium and outlet stores in strategic locations, with such locations designed primarily to support our online
platform.

In 2012, the BestSecret Group’s founding families sold a majority stake of 61% of the business to Ardian. In 2014,
construction commenced on the new centralized fulfillment center in Poing, Germany (near Munich), which
became operational in early 2016 and consolidated our then-existing seven warehouses. In 2014, we expanded
our offline retail footprint through the opening of a new store in Vienna, Austria. In 2016, we acquired Swiss
Online Shopping AG, a leading off-price player in Switzerland, to further expand our online presence in Germany,
Austria and Switzerland (hereafter referred to as the DACH region). In January 2017, funds owned and managed
by Permira acquired a majority stake in the Group. In 2019 and 2020, we expanded our fulfillment center in Poing,
Germany by approximately 60% to support our business growth.

In late 2020, Dr. Moritz Hahn joined us after nine years of experience at Zalando SE where he served as a member
of the Executive Committee and held numerous senior positions. He has since built a strong leadership team of ecommerce pioneers with decades of relevant experience across the tech and e-commerce industry, complemented
by senior individuals with long-term experience at and in-depth knowledge of the Company. In early 2021, this
senior leadership team announced a new strategy which is focused on online pure-play, profitable growth across
Europe. The offline strategy was sharpened to focus on supporting our online value proposition with premium
stores designed to elevate our brand image and outlet stores to clear inventory that fails to sell online. In 2021, the

7


-----

structure and brand profile across the Group was simplified and harmonized, merging and renaming the companies
to solely feature the BestSecret name across the Group. In 2023, we launched our Elevation Strategy to grow the
share of highly desirable premium and luxury brands in our portfolio. We also enhanced our online presence by
introducing a new high-end design for our app and online shop and by adding a dedicated luxury section, thereby
aligning more closely with the appeal of luxury brands. In the same year, our new fulfillment center in Sulechów,
Poland, commenced its preliminary stage of operations. In 2024, we expanded our Sulechów fulfillment center
by 40,000 square meters to a total footprint of 120,000 square meters.

**Principal Shareholder**

Permira is a global investment firm that backs successful businesses with growth ambitions. Founded in 1985, the
firm advises funds with total committed capital of more than €80 billion and makes long-term majority and
minority investments. The Permira Funds have made more than 300 private equity investments in four key sectors:
technology, consumer, healthcare and services. Permira employs over 500 people in 15 offices across Europe,
North America, and Asia.

The Permira Funds have invested in various businesses in the DACH region, such as Engel & Völkers,
Neruaxpharm, P&I and TeamViewer. The Permira Funds also have extensive expertise in the premium and luxury
fashion space and in-depth knowledge of dealing with global brands, including Hugo Boss, Valentino, Golden
Goose and Dr. Martens.

repay and redeem the Existing Notes on, or soon after the First Optional

Par Redemption Date, (ii) to fund a distribution to the shareholder of the
Issuer and (iii) to pay certain fees and expenses in relation to the
Transactions. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will deposit the net proceeds
from the Offering into the Depository Account. Pursuant to the terms of
the Depository Agreement, such deposited net proceeds will be released
on, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in order to
consummate the Existing Notes Redemption whereas the residual
amount following the Existing Notes Redemption shall be transferred to
the Issuer. For further information, please see “Use of Proceeds.”

**Optional Redemption .......................... The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes:**

                      - at any time prior to      , 2025, in whole or in part at a
redemption price equal to 100.000% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
(but excluding) the date of redemption, plus Additional
Amounts, if any, and the applicable “make-whole”
premium;

                      - at any time on or after     , 2025, in whole or in part at
100.000% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the date of
redemption and Additional Amounts, if any.

See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Additional Amounts;**
**Tax Redemption ................................... Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in**

respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made
without withholding or deduction for taxes in any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes”) unless required by law. Subject to certain exceptions and_
limitations, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or the Paying Agent is required
by law to withhold or deduct such taxes with respect to a payment on any
Note, the Issuer or that Guarantor will pay the Additional Amounts (as
defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) necessary so
that the net amount received by each holder after such withholding is not
less than the amount that would have been received in the absence of the
withholding.

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction become
effective after the issuance of the Notes that would impose withholding
taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes, and would
require the Issuer or any Guarantor to pay Additional Amounts, the Issuer
may redeem the Notes, in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to but not including
the date of redemption.

may be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred if certain consolidated net leverage ratios are not exceeded in
connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.”_

**Certain Covenants ............................... The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the Issuer**

and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein), to:

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_The following tables present the Issuer’s summary financial information and should be read in conjunction with_
_the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim_
_Financial Statements which are reproduced elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, and the section entitled_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Audited_
_Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and the additional requirements of_
_German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e para. 1 of the HGB and were audited in accordance with_
_Section 317 of the HGB and German generally accepted standards for financial statements audits promulgated_
_by the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) by EY, which issued an_
_unqualified independent auditor’s report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) thereon in_
_each case. The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements were prepared in accordance_
_with IFRS on interim financial reporting (IAS 34). The financial information below is not necessarily indicative_
_of the results of future operations._

_In the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the Issuer changed the presentation of liabilities in_
_connection with its existing reverse factoring supply chain financing arrangements in the consolidated statement_
_of financial position. The liabilities from supply chain financing were reclassified from line item “trade and other_
_payables” to line item “other current financial liabilities” in order to improve the informative value of the_
_consolidated financial statements and increase comparability with other companies. The comparative figures as_
_of December 31, 2022 have been adjusted in the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements accordingly._
_As a result, certain figures in the Group’s statement of financial position information as of December 31, 2022_
_presented in this Offering Memorandum, have been taken from the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial_
_Statements. For more information see Note 5.13 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements._

_The financial information marked as “audited” in the following tables is taken from the Audited Consolidated_
_Financial Statements. The financial information marked as “unaudited” in the following tables is taken from the_
_Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and the Issuer’s accounting systems or is based_
_on calculations of figures from the abovementioned sources._

_We present below certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios that are not required by or presented in_
_accordance with IFRS, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies, Run Rate Adjusted_
_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin, Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital_
_Expenditure, Operating Net Working Capital, Operating Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion Before Run Rate Cost_
_Synergies and certain leverage and coverage ratios, among others. There can be no assurance that items we have_
_identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in_
_the future. The non-IFRS financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and_
_should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other_
_measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures as presented in this_
_Offering Memorandum may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by_
_other companies, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted_
_EBITDA differ from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the section “Description of the Notes” of this Offering_
_Memorandum and the Indenture. The non-IFRS financial measures may not give an accurate or complete picture_
_of our financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when_
_making an investment decision. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

_The historical financial information below is not necessarily indicative of results of future operations and should_
_be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Consolidated Financial_
_Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and_
_our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and our Audited Consolidated Financial_
_Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

define “Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies” as EBITDA adjusted for exceptional items as described below before
run-rate cost synergies arising from fulfilment center network expansion. We define “Run Rate **Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA**
adjusted for exceptional items as described below and run-rate cost synergies arising from the fulfillment center network expansion. We

Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS and should each be viewed as a
supplement to, not a substitute for, our results of operations presented in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before
Run Rate Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of financial performance derived in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
Before Run Rate Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from and may
not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other companies and differ from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in
the section ”Description of the Notes” of this Offering Memorandum and in the Indenture. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
Before Run Rate Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only. There is no assurance that items we
have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The
non-IFRS financial measures may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the

Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they are helpful to investors
as financial measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost

(a) Represents exceptional items for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly comprised costs related to COVID-19 pandemic

(€7.6 million), costs for restructuring and reorganization (€7.0 million), costs incurred in relation to introduction/improvement
of tools and processes (€4.1 million), as well as expenses occurred in expansion and improvement of fulfillment center network
and processes (€2.3 million). Exceptional items for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly comprised costs incurred in
relation to introduction/improvement of new tools and processes (€6.7 million), costs for restructuring and reorganization (€5.6
million) as well as set-up expenses in connection with the new fulfillment center in Poland (€2.6 million). Exceptional items
for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly comprised costs incurred in relation to introduction/improvement of new tools
and processes (€4.7 million), expenses related to the non-recurring and one-time inflation compensation for employees (€2.9
million), costs for restructuring and reorganization (€2.0 million) as well as set-up expenses in connection with the new
fulfillment center in Poland (€1.5 million). Exceptional items for the three months ended March 31, 2023, mainly comprised
expenses related to the non-recurring and one-time inflation compensation for employees (€1.0 million), set-up expenses in
connection with the new fulfillment center in Poland (€0.9 million), costs for restructuring and reorganization (€0.7 million)
as well as costs incurred in relation to introduction/improvement of new tools and processes (€0.7 million). Exceptional items
for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly comprised costs incurred in relation to introduction/improvement of new
tools and processes (€3.6 million), expenses related to the non-recurring and one-time inflation compensation for employees
(€1.1 million) as well as set-up expenses in connection with the new fulfillment center in Poland (€0.9 million).

(b) Represents expected cost synergies from the fulfillment center network expansion from Q4 2022 onwards and until the

fulfillment center in Poland is fully operational. The expected cost synergies result from improved unit economics on the basis
of capacity optimization (reduction of utilization rate of existing fulfillment center and the elimination of the need to rent
additional warehouse capacity) as well as from wage and automation benefits.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies for a
period divided by revenue for that period. Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for a period
divided by revenue for that period.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA of the Holdco includes additional administrative expenses for holding services which, in the year ended December 31,
2023, for the first time resulted in a tangible difference in adjusted EBITDA at the level of the Issuer and the Holdco due to the transfer
of central functions from the Issuer to the Holdco in that year. Adjusted EBITDA for the Holdco amounted to €44.6 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and €175.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of
13.6% and 14.3%, respectively.

(5) “Operating Free Cash Flow” is defined as EBITDA plus the changes in net foreign exchange differences, increase/decrease in other
liabilities and provisions, decrease/increase in other assets, decrease/increase in trade and other receivables, decrease/increase in
inventories and similar assets, increase/decrease in trade payables and other liabilities each as shown in net cash flows from operating

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this_
_offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes. The_
_risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of_
_which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition and results of operations. If any of the possible events described below were to occur, our_
_business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens,_
_the trading prices of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when_
_due and you could lose all or part of your investment. The order in which these risks are presented is not intended_
_to provide an indication of the likelihood of their occurrence or their severity or significance._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See_
_“Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these_
_forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described below_
_and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_Our business depends on our ability to continuously source and present a variety and quantity of attractive_**
**_products from various popular brands at attractive prices that will satisfy our customers’ preferences and_**
**_demands._**

The success of our business depends on our ability to continuously source attractive and high-quality merchandise
from a broad selection of high-quality brands at attractive prices and in a timely manner. If we are unable to
maintain our existing relationships or build new relationships with brands on favorable commercial terms, we may
be unable to offer an appropriate selection or quantity of merchandise at discounted prices, which would reduce
the appeal of our offering. Only a few of the brand partners we work with have a continuing obligation to provide
us with merchandise at historical levels or at all. Furthermore, building new relationships with prospective brand
partners can be a lengthy and time-consuming process leading to prolonged lead times until merchandise becomes
available for our members to purchase, which in turn could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction.

Our business depends on successful merchandise financial planning and open-to-buy management (a management
system that aligns budgets to planned inventory). If these prove inadequate, we could fail to secure and offer an
attractive inventory to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

Additionally, certain goods are purchased from intermediaries rather than the brands themselves. Such goods have
an increased risk of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. Certain brands have, in the past, alleged
that we have sold merchandise which infringes upon their intellectual property. We investigated these allegations
and determined that, in certain minor cases, the merchandise sold did infringe third party intellectual property
rights. In such cases, we may not have any viable recourse against such intermediaries, as they tend to have little
economic substance. Furthermore, any inadvertent promotion and sale of counterfeit merchandise may harm our
reputation and lead to loss of trust and customers.

Our business also depends on sufficient availability of overstock in the market, which could be adversely affected
by supply chain disruptions, changes to the distribution plans of our brand partners or an overall decline in the
fashion market. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has and will potentially
continue to have a wide range of supply chain implications, including increases in cost and disruption in freight
transport. Similarly, the lockdowns and the temporary port closures in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
more recently, the military conflict between Israel and Hamas and its spillover effects throughout the Middle East,
including the Houthi attacks on the Red Sea, have in the past and may lead in the future to lower availability of
stock because of transportation delays and, in the case of the military conflicts, may also result in increased sea
freight rates due to the rerouting of ships around the southern tip of Africa and increased air freight rates due to
heightened demand in response to the effects of the conflict on maritime logistics. Additionally, any further
escalation of the ongoing political conflict between China and Taiwan may have a widespread effect on global
supply chains, including decreases to global economic output and decreases to global trade. See also “––Negative
_developments in global and local economic conditions in our markets could adversely impact consumer spending_
_in the fashion market.” Additionally, our brand partners may not be willing or able to fulfill our product requests_
(partially or fully) due to lack of stock, changes in their supply-chain model or aggressive competition from other
industry participants, including other off-price retailers, both online and offline, bidding against us for the same

24


-----

merchandise. Furthermore, brand partners may start managing their product relationships with sellers on a global,
rather than local level, which could adversely affect us.

As a result of our exclusive, invitation-only membership model, we must balance exclusivity and the protection
of brand equity with our growth ambitions. If we fail to strike an appropriate balance, we could fail to achieve our
desired growth or negatively affect the brand equity of our brand partners, who may decide to prevent us from
offering merchandise for sale through a particular sales channel. Our ability to build a relevant offering for our
customers through a broad assortment of desirable products in the right categories and quantities could also be
affected if we are prevented from offering merchandise through a particular sales channel.

If we are unable to secure an appropriate selection and quantity of merchandise on terms and conditions acceptable
to us, we may be unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers and consequently increase or
maintain sales, which could also diminish the attractiveness of our proposition for brand partners, limiting access
to merchandise, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We face strong competition in our markets and such competition may intensify further._**

We are a leading European members-only destination for online off-price fashion, operating in the market for
mid-market to luxury fashion. We provide our customers with exclusive access to a sizeable portfolio of brands,
while offering our brand partners a structural solution to sell their overstock through a discreet and controlled
channel. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are online off-price
and full-price retailers and platforms, including those devoted solely to fashion as well as other types of online
platforms and including single-brand as well as multi-brand retailers and marketplaces. In addition, we are to
some extent also competing with offline off-price and full-price retailers, such as traditional retail stores, brand
outlet stores and off-price fashion stores, due to the operation of our outlet locations and due to partially
overlapping customer demographics and supply markets. Furthermore, the rising popularity of discount and fast
fashion retailers, such as Shein and Temu, has expanded the competitive landscape, potentially paving the way
for new competitors in our market. Furthermore, we are always subject to competition imposed by new market
entrants. New competitors who enter our markets or existing offline competitors that shift to online platforms may
be successful in attracting customers, including our customers, and thereby capturing market share from us,
particularly in Germany, our core market.

Some of our current and potential future competitors may have greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other
resources than we do. Such competitors may be able to out-bid us for merchandise we would like to access, acquire
more attractive merchandise in greater quantities, deliver merchandise more rapidly, or devote more resources to
technology, order fulfillment and marketing than we can. The internet facilitates competitive entry and
comparison-shopping and renders e-commerce inherently more competitive than other retail channels. In addition,
new and enhanced technologies, including search services, may favor our competition. Also, alternative business
models may emerge that would compete with us or diminish the attractiveness or utility of our business model. In
particular, social commerce, that is, the use of social networks in the context of e-commerce transactions, as well
as the growing popularity of online secondhand fashion retail, could potentially disrupt our business model.

If we are unable to compete effectively and fail to attract our target customers to purchase our merchandise, we
could lose market share to our competitors. In addition, our brand partners allocate merchandise among ourselves
and our competitors depending on the timeliness of orders. If we are unable to act quickly when our brand partners
make their merchandise available for purchase, or if we otherwise fail to procure merchandise from our brand
partners, for example, due to lack of availability in the market or if the brand partner decides to sell it to another
competitor in the market, we could lose market share to our competitors. Furthermore, our plans to expand our
business operations into new markets and markets in which we currently have a relatively small presence may be
adversely affected by strong competition. For example, some of our competitors may already have long
established customer or brand relationships and operations in these markets, which may put them at a competitive
advantage. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully. Should competitive pressure
intensify, the resources available to adjust our operations effectively and in a timely manner could be negatively
impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Consolidation in the online retail fashion industry could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition, and results of operations._**

The online market for off-price mid-market to luxury fashion is undergoing rapid growth and substantial change,
which has resulted in increased competition and a consolidation trend. Acquisitions or other consolidating

25


-----

transactions could harm us in a number of ways, including losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing
our company to expend greater resources to meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm
our operating results. Newly formed competitors and increased competition, threatening our market position or
copying our business model, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Negative developments in global and local economic conditions in our markets could adversely impact_**
**_consumer spending in the fashion market._**

We primarily sell fashion products online. Purchases of our customers are discretionary, and therefore dependent
upon the level of customer spending, particularly among affluent customers. As a result, our performance depends
on global and regional economic conditions, which have shown significant volatility in recent years. For example,
economic contraction, economic uncertainty, and the perception by our customers of weak or weakening
economic conditions, whether as a result of global pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical
conflicts, such as the conflict in Ukraine, the military conflict between Israel and Hamas and its spillover effects
throughout the Middle East or the ongoing political conflict between China and Taiwan, or otherwise, has and
could cause a decline in the demand for the merchandise we sell. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict
in Ukraine or, more recently, the military conflict between Israel and Hamas and its spillover effects throughout
the Middle East or any further escalation of the ongoing political conflict between China and Taiwan, and their
respective related effects have in the past and/or may lead in the future to a disruption of our supply chain or a
decline in the supply of products produced by our brand partners, which could in turn lead to supply shortages.

The COVID-19 pandemic has in the past led and a similar global pandemic, including a resurgence of the COVID19 pandemic in the future, may lead to closure of our retail stores on a temporary or permanent basis. If we are
forced to close any of our retail stores, whether as a result of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or a different
global pandemic, or for any other reason, there is no guarantee that we would be able to reduce or fully eliminate
the fixed costs related to the operation and maintenance of such stores. For example, there is no guarantee that we
would be able to terminate the relevant leases, secure subleases or implement any other cost-defraying
arrangement for the remainder of the lease terms.

Furthermore, among other circumstances, factors such as inflation, higher unemployment levels, rising interest
rates, reduced access to credit, recessionary economic cycles, increases in taxes or perceived or actual declines in
disposable consumer income and wealth may influence changes in discretionary consumer spending.

Our online platform is available in multiple languages and offers shipping to 27 European countries, with the
majority of our revenue currently generated in Germany, although an increasing portion of our revenue is
generated in the international markets. A negative development, contraction or lack of growth in the economies
of Germany or the other European countries where we operate or may operate in the future, and in overall
macroeconomic conditions, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We may be more affected by such economic weakness or uncertainty than some of our competitors
with more diversified international operations.

Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased
tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high
unemployment and currency fluctuations make it more difficult for us to manage our operations and accurately
forecast financial results. Worldwide economies have recently experienced inflationary pressures, with price
increases seen across many sectors globally. In response to inflationary pressures, central banks have made steep
increases in interest rates, which result in increases in the interest rates available to us on any potential new debt
financing for our operations. Whether the present inflationary pressures will transition to a long-term inflationary
environment and the effects of such a development in the sector in which we operate are uncertain. Additionally,
the monetary tightening implemented by a series of central banks around the world in order to curb inflationary
pressures has also significantly increased the probability of an economic recession in the short-to-medium term.
For example, Germany, our home market, which experienced a long period of stable economic growth since the
financial crisis of 2007-2008, entered into an economic recession in 2023, when its real GDP declined by 0.3%
(0.1% after adjustment for calendar effects) according to the German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis
(Statistisches Bundesamt). Although Germany’s gross domestic product reported a 0.7% increase in 2023
compared to 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the deep labor shortages in skilled high-growth
sectors, the weak global economic growth paired with high interest rates and the military conflict between Israel
and Hamas and its spillover effects throughout the Middle East, including the Houthi attacks on the Red Sea and
their effect on global logistics will likely continue to dampen economic prospects in Germany, and more generally,
Europe, in the short term. While Germany still generates most of our revenue (60.1% in the year ended

26


-----

December 31, 2023), the international sales share has increased substantially in recent years and international
growth is one of our current strategic focus areas.

Geopolitical tensions, including but not limited to tensions between Russia and its neighboring countries,
including Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states, the military conflict between Israel and Hamas and its spillover
effects throughout the Middle East the ongoing political conflict between China and Taiwan, existing tensions
between China and the United States or acts of terrorism, could also negatively affect the demand for, and supply
of, our merchandise. Such instability could lead to disruptions to the operations of our fulfillment center in Poland.
Such geopolitical tensions may also negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer shopping behavior,
which could in turn affect our sales and results of operation.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the pace and extent of the global economic recovery remains highly
uncertain, and certain markets may not in the future achieve the growth rates that they have historically observed.
The aggravation of the foregoing factors including the ongoing geopolitical conflicts and/or, more generally, an
extended recession or other periods of declining economic conditions, either globally or in any of the markets in
which we operate, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. If
our markets do not develop as anticipated or are negatively affected by global and local economic conditions, as
well as geopolitical tensions, consumer spending in the fashion market may be adversely affected and demand for
our products may not increase as currently anticipated. Consequently, we may not be able to recoup the
investments made in these markets and may be forced to close, or decide to divest, our operations in selected
markets, which could have an adverse material effect on the implementation of our expansion strategy and
consequently on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our industry and the sale of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuations and unfavorable weather._**

The industry in which we operate is seasonal in nature, and our revenue, profits, liquidity and inventory levels are
therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, we typically experience an increase in sales in the fourth
quarter of the year due to special sales events (e.g., Cyber Week) and the Christmas shopping season. In the year
ended December 31, 2023, revenue in the fourth quarter accounted for 33.0% of our total revenue for the year.
These seasonal influences have a direct impact on our results of operations and overall profitability. Any factors
that deter customers from purchasing online or visiting our stores during these periods could have a
disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.

In addition, atypical weather conditions may impact our sales and operating results. When the weather is warmer
than expected in the autumn and winter months, our customers tend to purchase fewer winter collection items.
Similarly, when the weather is cooler than expected in the summer months, our customers tend to purchase fewer
summer collection items. During times of such unfavorable or unpredicted weather conditions, we may be required
to lower our prices, negatively impacting our margins and our profit. If we cannot offset the lower-sales seasons
with those having stronger sales, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
affected.

Seasonal fluctuations also impact our working capital, liquidity levels and inventory. We incur additional expenses
in the preparation for the increased demand we typically expect leading up to, and around, the special sales events
(e.g., Cyber Week sale) and Christmas season and other peak selling periods and therefore must carry a significant
amount of inventory before such periods, which impacts our liquidity.

If too many customers access our website within a short period of time due to increased demand or unexpectedly
strong peaks arising, for example, in the context of special sales events such as those aforementioned, our
businesses may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently
fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we are able to offer or sell and the attractiveness of our
products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment networks and customer
service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other third-party shipping (or carrier) companies may
be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Seasonal products, such as winter clothing, which delivery is delayed
may, as a result of such delays, only be sold in the next season and may increase storage costs.

Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors,
including but not limited to unfavorable weather, age and quantity of inventory at period end and the timing,
extent and impact of government-imposed restrictions, including closed borders or other restrictions on business
activities resulting from new legislation related to any public health emergency, pandemic or otherwise. As a
result, historical period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future

27


-----

period-to-period results. The results of a single fiscal quarter may not be an indication of our annual results or our
future performance.

Increasing weather anomalies could complicate forecasting seasonal demand. Natural disasters, such as storms,
tornadoes, floods, earthquakes or other major weather disasters may also have a negative impact on our business.
Our inability to compensate for seasonal fluctuations and adapt to weather conditions may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If sensitive information about our customers is disclosed, our customers may curtail use of our sites, we may_**
**_be exposed to liability and our reputation would suffer, and disclosure of our confidential information could_**
**_adversely affect our business and operations._**

We operate apps, websites and other data systems through which we collect, maintain, transmit and store
information about our customers, brand partners and others, including personal information, as well as other
confidential and proprietary information. In addition, we gather and retain information about our employees in
the normal course of business. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit
proprietary, personal, and confidential information on our behalf. Furthermore, we rely on a variety of security
measures, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely
transmit confidential and sensitive information, including but not limited to credit card details.

Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate
applicable privacy and data security laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) as well
as other applicable laws, and cause significant legal and financial risks, adverse publicity, or a loss of confidence
in our security measures. See “—We are subject to numerous laws and regulations with respect to data protection
_and failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in litigation and administrative or arbitration_
_proceedings and/or significantly damage our relationship with our customers”._

Customer data may be misappropriated as a result of computer viruses, telecommunications failures, electronic
break-ins and similar disruptions. If we or our third-party service providers experience, or are believed to have
experienced, security breaches that result in problems to our sites’ performance or availability or the loss or
corruption of, or unauthorized access to or disclosure of, personal data or confidential information, our customers
may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to make purchases on our sites. Existing customers
may also decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential liability and
litigation as a result of security breaches, our online content or other consumer privacy concerns, which may not
be adequately covered by insurance. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, our business, and our
reputation.

Furthermore, certain employees have access to sensitive confidential information relating to our business,
especially relating to the functioning of our apps and websites, our proprietary machine learning algorithms, and
big data infrastructure. While we have confidentiality agreements and technical measures in place, we cannot
assure that third parties or the general public never gain access to such information. Any ineffective protection of
such information relating to our business might materially weaken our market position and thus adversely affect
our business and operations.

**_We are exposed to the risk of security breaches, including cyber-attacks, and unauthorized use of one or more_**
**_of our websites, databases, online security systems or computerized logistics management systems._**

Like other online platforms, we are vulnerable to the risk of security breaches, including real or perceived
cyberattacks and unauthorized use of one or more of our websites, databases, online security systems or
computerized logistics management systems. While we take extensive steps to protect the security, integrity and
confidentiality of sensitive and confidential information (e.g., security policies, firewall, and internal Security
Operation Centre), our security practices or those of our third-party service providers may be insufficient and third
parties may breach our systems (e.g., through Trojans, spyware, ransomware or other malware attacks, or breaches
by our employees or third-party service providers). Such attacks or breaches which may result in shutdowns of
our sites, loss or corruption of data or unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Such attacks might lead to
blackmailing attempts, forcing us to pay substantial amounts to release our captured data or resulting in the
unauthorized release of such data, or to identity theft or unauthorized purchases, requiring us to pay compensation
to the victims. Cyberattacks could also target our logistics, supply or office systems, which could result in order
fulfillment delays, leading to cancelled orders and a subsequent decline in revenue, as well as reputational
damages. We have been subject to attempted cyber, phishing or social engineering attacks in the past and may
continue to be subject to such attacks in the future. As we gain greater visibility, we may face a higher risk of

28


-----

being targeted by cyberattacks. We may also need to devote significant resources to protect against security
breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, which may require us to divert resources from the growth
and expansion of our business.

We and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or
prevent all such cyberattacks. Moreover, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change
frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers, and consequently
it may be impossible to properly secure our systems. In addition, technical advances or a continued expansion and
increased complexity of our IT infrastructure, as well as non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent
actions by our employees, our third-party service providers, or their personnel, could increase the likelihood of
security breaches. As we have significantly increased the number of employees working remotely following the
COVID-19 pandemic, and as our businesses’ vendors and other business partners continue to work remotely as
well, our business and our partners may be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Increasingly, unauthorized parties
are exploiting access they gain to third party vendors to target companies that do business with these vendors, and
this may include third party vendors with whom we do business.

Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments have increased and could
further increase the frequency or likelihood of security breaches. In addition, security breaches can also occur as
a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with
whom we have commercial relationships, including third-party developers, consultants, outsourced customer
support or operational personnel of hosting providers (e.g., Microsoft, Noris AG) with direct access to databases
and customer-related services.

The materialization of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects as well as our reputation.

**_Any failure to operate, maintain, integrate and scale our information technology systems could result in_**
**_customer dissatisfaction, loss of revenue or subject us to claims for damages._**

Our business, as an online platform with physical retail presence, is dependent on the smooth functioning of our
information technology systems, especially our internet and mobile infrastructure, as well as third-party
infrastructure such as Microsoft Azure, which are critical to our business and inherently subject to various
operating risks. For example, our offering is founded on our vertically integrated, proprietary technology platform
specifically designed for the sourcing, presentation, curation, marketing, and fulfillment of fashion products. In
addition, as an e-commerce platform, we generate a high volume of traffic on, and use of, our apps and websites
to analyze a broad range of customer data, tracking individual journeys and ensuring efficient spending of our
marketing resources. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers are dependent upon the
reliable performance of our apps and websites and their underlying network infrastructure. As our customer base
and the amount of information shared on our apps and websites continue to grow, we will require additional
network capacity and computing power. In addition, we need to maintain reliable internet and mobile networks
with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as ensuring timely development of complementary
products. Furthermore, we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties in part to maintain and
develop our computer hardware and software.

The operation of our technology systems is expensive and complex, and due to that complexity, could result in
operational failures. Certain of our technology platforms have long development cycles and comparatively low
productivity, resulting in extended periods required to introduce new features as well as high development costs.
In addition, we are exposed to the risk of our technology systems being undersized and functionally maladjusted
or incompatible with certain electronic devices that are used by our customers. Our customers may also find our
websites difficult to use or may be unwilling to use our online platform for other reasons. In addition, our
customers may lack confidence in the security of our online platform and may consequently be unwilling to share
personal information with us through the online platform. In the event that our customer base or the amount of
traffic on our websites grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional
costs to enhance the underlying network infrastructure. Inadequate performance of our technology systems,
whether due to telecommunication problems, software errors, inadequate capacity at IT centers, fire, power
outages or damage, attacks by third parties, computer viruses and the delayed or failed implementation of new
computer systems or other unexpected events or causes, could affect the security or availability of our apps and
websites, prevent customers from accessing our apps and websites and result in limited capacity, reduced demand,
processing delays and loss of customers. Our existing safety systems, data backup, access protection, user
management and IT emergency planning may not be sufficient to prevent information loss or disruptions to our
IT infrastructure. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security and availability

29


-----

of our products and technology systems to the satisfaction of our customers and certain regulators could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we need to continuously improve and upgrade our systems
and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of user-enhanced services, features and functionalities, while
maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. If we fail to make
necessary upgrades, our technology systems and data platform could be insufficient to allow us to make datadriven decisions, in both the context of our day-to-day operations and our larger business initiatives as our business
grows and expands in scope. For example, we have recently implemented, among other projects, a new enterprise
resource planning (“ERP”) system to support our human resources, sales and distribution, inventory planning,
retail merchandising and operational and financial reporting systems of our business and expect further releases
of the ERP system in the coming months. Despite our efforts to ensure product compliance and embed quality
management up to standard, we cannot assure that our actions will at all times be sufficient to ensure that all our
products, including our ERP system, meet all regulatory requirements and/or fulfill customer expectations. For
example, there is a risk that the ERP system fails to interface successfully or work seamlessly in conjunction with
our existing systems. As a result, dependent projects may not be realized within expected timeframes.
Furthermore, we may experience operational problems with our ERP system as a result of system failures, viruses,
ransomware, computer “hackers” or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could
cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost, unavailable or delayed, which could result
in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our offline stores and customers or lost sales, which could reduce
demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. Moreover, the failure to maintain, or a disruption in,
financial and management control systems could have a material adverse effect on our ability to respond to trends
in our target markets, market our products and meet our customers’ requirements. Any of the foregoing is likely
to create additional costs and negatively impact our topline growth goals. While we expect the ERP system to
strengthen our internal financial controls, there are inherent risks in implementing any new system, including loss
of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. Any material deficiencies in the design and
implementation of this new software could also result in material costs, adversely affect our ability to operate our
business and negatively impact our financial reporting and internal controls. In addition, any upgrades,
developments or maintenance of our systems and infrastructure, including the ERP system, may lead us to incur
unexpected costs.

We use cloud services to store and maintain customer data as well as to support our IT infrastructure. An
interruption or breakdown of our technology systems and IT infrastructure due to power outages, fire, natural
disasters, acts of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, actions of third-party providers or any other unanticipated
reason cannot be ruled out completely. The disaster recovery arrangements we have put in place, have not been
tested during actual disasters or similar events and may not effectively permit us to continue to run our business
in the event of any problems with respect to the data that we use. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurances
that these types of events will not occur in the future. If our cloud service partners fail, we may experience
downtime on our apps and websites which could reduce the attractiveness of our apps and websites to customers.
Failure in our IT infrastructure could also result in unfavorable media coverage, damage our reputation, and/or
result in regulatory inquiries or other proceedings.

**_Any failure to operate and maintain, integrate, and scale our network and mobile infrastructure could result_**
**_in customer dissatisfaction, and thus harm our reputation, lead to a loss of revenue or subject us to claims for_**
**_damages, which could jeopardize the implementation of our further growth strategy and have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Customer growth and_**
**_activity on mobile devices depends upon effective use of mobile operating systems, networks, and standards_**
**_that we do not control._**

Purchases using mobile devices by customers generally, and by our customers specifically, have increased
significantly, and we expect this trend to continue. Therefore, we must be able to present our offering to our
customers through a unique and personalized online fashion experience using machine learning algorithms and
big data. If we are unable to present our offering on our apps, websites and in our stores in an inspiring and
attractive way or if we are unable to adapt to the fast-changing developments of social media platforms, we may
be unable to attract new customers, may lose existing customers or may be faced with reduced volumes of
purchases on our apps and websites, which could limit our growth and prevent us from achieving or maintaining
profitability. To deliver a desirable online fashion experience to our customers, we rely on third parties and our
brand partners to create content (including photography, other media, and text) which we use on our online
platform, in marketing campaigns, advertisements and our online presence generally. Furthermore, at present, our
externalization of content creation is highly concentrated as we only have two third-party providers. Any failure

30


-----

by such third parties or our brand partners to produce content that effectively promotes our products could have a
significant adverse effect on our business.

To optimize the mobile shopping experience, we are dependent on our customers downloading our specific mobile
app for their particular device(s) or accessing our website from an internet browser. With the continued release of
new mobile devices and operating systems, we face difficulties predicting the problems we may encounter in
developing apps for these alternative devices and operating systems, and we may need to devote significant
resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such applications. In addition, our future growth and our
results of operations could suffer if we experience difficulties in the future in integrating our apps into mobile
devices, if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile app stores,
such as Apple App Store or Google Play, if our apps receive unfavorable treatment compared to competing
applications, such as the order of our apps within application stores, or if we face increased costs to distribute or
have customers use our mobile applications. We are further dependent on the interoperability of our sites with
popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as iOS and Android, and any changes in such
systems that degrade the functionality of our sites or give preferential treatment to competitive products could
adversely affect the usage of our sites on mobile devices.

Further, we continually upgrade existing technologies and business applications, and we may be required to
implement new technologies or business applications in the future. The implementation of upgrades and changes
requires significant investments. The timing, effectiveness and costs associated with the successful
implementation of any upgrades or changes to our systems and infrastructure could have adverse effects on our
results of operations.

In the event that it is more difficult for our customers to access and use our sites on their mobile devices, or if our
customers choose not to access or to use our sites on their mobile devices or to use mobile products that do not
offer access to our sites, our customer growth could be affected and our business, financial condition and results
of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Failure to improve our delivery systems and infrastructure to meet the technological developments and demands
of our growing operations could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. As our operations expand in size and scope, we will need to continually improve and upgrade the
systems and infrastructure that support our supply chain while maintaining or improving the reliability and
integrity of our systems and infrastructure. We must be able to incorporate new technologies into our services in
order to address the needs of our customers. Our e-commerce platform may become unstable or unavailable due
to failure to perform necessary upgrades, exposure to cyber-attacks or any other failure of our computer systems
and related information technology infrastructure. The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile and
tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services
or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such
as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower up-front
technology costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete with advancing technology or be able
to maintain existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or
in a cost-effective manner, and any failure to do so could result in customers seeking alternative products or
service providers, thereby adversely impacting our revenue and operating income.

The functioning of our online business depends to a large extent on our customers receiving the ordered goods in
a timely and smooth manner and being able to return them without any difficulties. If the traffic volume on our
websites or the number of purchases made by customers substantially increases, our current transaction processing
systems, network infrastructure, storage facilities and delivery systems may be unable to accommodate the
increased volume. This includes our own systems, services and infrastructure as well as those owned and/or
managed by third parties. Additionally, we may be unable to accurately forecast these increases or to upgrade our
supply chain systems in time to accommodate them. If our delivery infrastructure comes under strain from an
unexpected or higher-than-expected spike in customer orders, or for any other reason, we may be unable to honor
orders on our usual delivery terms, which could lead to negative reputational consequences for ourselves and our
brand partners. Furthermore, our transaction processing systems may result in our online platform displaying
expected delivery times to our customers that do not reflect actual order backlogs or delivery times.
Inconsistencies between expected and actual delivery times could lead to customer dissatisfaction with our online
platform.

**_If we fail to adopt new technologies or adapt our websites, mobile apps and systems to changing customer_**
**_requirements or emerging industry standards, our business may be materially and adversely affected._**

To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features
of our online platforms, including our websites and mobile apps. The internet and the e-commerce industry are
characterized by rapid technological evolution, such as emerging artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine
learning technologies, frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies and the
emergence of new industry standards and practices, and changes in customer requirements and preferences, any
of which could render our existing technologies and systems obsolete. We may be required to devote substantial
resources to developing proprietary technologies or license technologies, enhancing our existing websites and
mobile apps, developing new services and technology such as AI and machine learning that address the
increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers and adapting to technological
advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner. The
development of proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. There can be no assurance
that our efforts to develop proprietary technologies will succeed or that any technology licenses will be available
on commercially reasonable terms. Substantial investments will be required to remain technologically
competitive, and our failure to do so may harm our business and results of operations.

**_Inability to forecast our business accurately could prevent us from properly planning expenses and process_**
**_capacity._**

We base our current and future expense levels on our forecasts of our business and estimates of future revenue.
Such future revenue and results of operations are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume,
timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. Seasonal variations in our inventories, working
capital requirements and cash flows, among other things, also increase the difficulty of our financial forecasting
and could adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results. For any given season, a substantial
portion of our expenses is incurred in advance, and therefore fixed, due to the seasonality of demand for our
products and the necessity of purchasing merchandise with significant lead times. As a result, we may be unable
to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue, which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we are unable to manage our inventory, or our online presence and store network in line with customer_**
**_demand, or if we are unable to otherwise forecast our business accurately, our sales levels and profitability_**
**_may decline._**

The off-price market for mid-market to luxury fashion is driven in part by fashion and beauty trends, and
consequently, the merchandise we sell is subject to changing consumer demands and preferences. Consumer
preferences regarding fashion design, quality, sustainability, and price tend to change rapidly. Hence, accurately
forecasting the selection and required quantities of such products in future periods is difficult. Accelerated by
short-term trends and the influence of social media on consumer demand, the popularity of products can change
significantly between the time products are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, the lead times we must incur
in receiving merchandise from our brand partners could pose challenges by increasing, in some cases significantly,
the time it takes us to respond to changes in product trends, consumer demand and market prices. Our success
depends in large part on our ability to anticipate, gauge, react and adapt to changing consumer demands in a timely
manner through the leveraging of our buying teams’ decision-making, experience, and relationships with brand
partners. Insufficient controls within the purchasing process may lead to unapproved or incorrect orders and may
result in financial disadvantages for the Group due to non-sellable inventory or liquidity risks.

To be responsive to shifting customer tastes, we must manage our inventory levels closely, including through
identifying market trends and seasonality. If we misjudge, fail to identify, or fail to react swiftly to changes in
consumer preferences and market trends, our sales could decrease, and we could see a significant increase in our
inventory levels. If we are left with high levels of unsold or returned stock, or if our inventory provisions are
inadequate, our storage capacity could be negatively impacted and we could be required to mark down some of
our merchandise, which could lower our operating profits and have a significant negative impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer interest in our
merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages, unfulfilled orders, increased distribution expenses and
lower revenue and profitability than we could otherwise have achieved. Inventory shortages could lead to
customer dissatisfaction and adversely impact our reputation and brand image.

As a result of the aforementioned factors, our future business strategies, practices, and results may not meet
expectations or respond quickly enough to customer demand, and we may face operational difficulties in adjusting

32

to any changes, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition, and prospects.

**_We depend on a reliable and efficient supply chain, which includes our fulfillment and returns centers,_**
**_transport service providers, third-party carriers that deliver merchandise to our online customers, and stores._**
**_Capacity constraints, interruptions or other failures in our supply chain could materially and adversely affect_**
**_our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

The profitability of our business depends on our ability to successfully process and deliver our customers’ orders.
Our ability to process and fill orders accurately and timely depends on the efficient, uninterrupted operation of
our fulfillment centers, in particular, our most significant ones in Poing, Germany and Sulechów, Poland, as well
as our warehouse management IT system. Our main fulfillment center is, therefore, critical to our business. If
operations at our fulfillment or returns centers were interrupted due to factors including, but not limited to, natural
disasters (such as flooding or fire), labor disruptions (such as labor strikes, shortages of temporary workers or
ethical disputes), technical defects, accidents, inappropriate storage of hazardous goods or any other reason, it
would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, due
to the high level of integration between our fulfillment centers and points of sale, any interruption of logistics at
our fulfillment centers would also have a significant adverse effect on our ability to supply our customers and
could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation. A number of factors, many of which are
beyond our control, could disrupt the operation of our supply chain and jeopardize our ability to receive, process
and deliver our customers’ orders. System interruptions in any of our own or externally operated technology
platforms and services could delay or prevent our receipt of customer orders, shipments or returns.

We are constantly monitoring our fulfillment and logistics capacity to keep up with those requirements and match
our continued growth. However, we cannot rule out that our significant and continued growth results in our
warehouse capacities being brought to their limits faster than anticipated. Due to the increasing levels of utilization
of our existing fulfillment and returns centers, our new fulfillment center in Sulechów, Poland, commenced
operations in 2023, providing us with additional flexibility, addressing our current needs, and positioning us to
handle additional future growth. This fulfillment center was expanded in 2024 by 40,000 square meters to a total
footprint of 120,000 square meters. However, we are still in the process of increasing its actual storage capacity
and throughput technology by installing the first picktower on one of our facilities and automation equipment.
Any incorrect assumptions regarding the necessary size, the technical design and the level of automation required
of this new facility or unexpected cost overruns, poor planning, delays in reaching full operations or other
unforeseen factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, as the new fulfillment center’s operations ramp up and until it reaches full operation, our
increasingly complex order fulfillment operation could have an adverse effect on our ability to supply our
customers, including as a result of split orders and orders that require movement between warehouses. As of
March 31, 2024, our total capital expenditure for this project amounted to €37.0 million. We currently anticipate
that the new fulfillment center in Poland will require additional capital expenditure across the years ending
December 31, 2024, through December 31, 2027. There can be no guarantee, however, that volatile raw material
prices and inflation will not cause our projected capital expenditure to be inaccurate or that we will be able to raise
additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Also, as we continue to grow and expand internationally, it is not
certain that we will be able to find suitable fulfillment center sites on commercially acceptable terms to support
any future expansion plans. We might also need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated in order
to increase the capacity of our logistics infrastructure. Any failure in the expansion of our fulfillment and logistics
infrastructure as our business expands could materially impact our growth strategy.

Our ability to deliver orders to our customers within a time frame that meets customer expectations also depends
on efficient internal processes as well as on third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced certain
processes such as the handling of bulky goods or returns, and third-party delivery companies in each of the
countries in which we operate. Any disruptions to these processes could also have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. We also rely on these third-party service providers for the
handling of certain processes and a limited number of third-party carriers, including DHL and Hermes, for the
delivery of merchandise to our fulfillment and return centers as well as for delivery to online customers. We are
therefore exposed to any failures or shortcomings by these service providers or carriers, including delivery delays
or damage, loss, or theft of goods.

Furthermore, if we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these entities, if they
significantly increase their charges or they experience performance problems, including as a result of inflationary
pressures and the current macroeconomic environment, it could negatively impact our customer experience. Any
breakdown or disruption of the activities of these service providers or carriers resulting from, among other things,

33


-----

inclement weather, natural disasters, transportation interruptions, labor shortages, oil price increases, epidemics
or unrest could impair our ability to supply our fulfillment center at current cost levels or at all, make timely
deliveries to customers or maintain an appropriate logistics chain and level of inventory, which could adversely
affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. The merger, acquisition, insolvency
or government regulation or shutdown of any third-party contractors we use in our supply chain could also
interrupt order processing, storage, and delivery. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain relationships with
our current carriers, and we may at any point be required to contract with other carriers at a potentially greater
cost. Finally, we may face price increases by the third-party carriers we use which may result in higher fulfillment
expenses we may only partially be able to pass on to our customers.

In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship merchandise to customers may be
negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or
terrorism, trade embargoes and similar factors. For example, strikes at major international shipping ports may in
the future impact our supply of inventory from our brand partners, and the escalating trade disputes between the
United States, the European Union, China and certain other regions could lead to increased tariffs on our goods.
If the manufacturing, delivery or supply chain management processes relating to our merchandise are disrupted
as a result of these factors or for any reason, we may be delayed in restoring our inventory of the affected products
and we may experience a significant increase in our cost of sales. Any failure to adequately manage and improve
our supply chain could reduce our transaction volume, increase cancelled orders, undermine customer satisfaction,
damage our business reputation, limit our competitiveness or otherwise materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Our online platform is available in multiple languages and offers shipping to 27 European countries, with the
majority of our revenue currently generated in our core market Germany, although the share of revenue generated
by the international market has sustainably increased over the past few years. As part of our ongoing strategy, we
expect to continue expanding internationally, which could lead to increased shipping and logistics costs that could
negatively impact our margins and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition, and prospects.

**_Our investments to grow our customer base through paid customer acquisition and viral growth and to retain_**
**_a loyal customer base may not be effective._**

Maintaining and growing our loyal customer base is critical to our success and profitability. In an environment
characterized by increasing levels of promotions and customer discounts, the growth of our customer base and
sales depends on the success of our general marketing activities, our incentive programs for customer referrals
from existing customers and our paid customer acquisition activities. We rely on social media to support the
positioning of our offering, extending invites to acquire new customers, increase the number of customer visits to
our websites, the number of orders and the basket size per order. In particular, we depend heavily on Meta
platforms (e.g., Facebook and Instagram), as our most-used paid customer acquisition marketing channel. Changes
to the terms and conditions of the relevant providers could limit our ability to communicate through social media.
These services may also change their algorithms or interfaces, including without notification, which may reduce
our visibility or increase our costs.

Our growth and profitability are dependent on our viral customer growth model, with existing customers inviting
their friends and families to join our community. In order to build on this structural customer growth, we have
recently increased our investments related to customer acquisition in underpenetrated regions and countries, and
we expect to continue to invest in attracting new customers. Paid social marketing (performance marketing and
social media marketing), which is geared to a critical, selected target group and closely aligned with our brand
partners, is our principal instrument to enter new opportunities in existing markets and new markets. Our
investments in viral marketing, paid customer acquisition and customer loyalty may prove ineffective. We also
use e-mail newsletters, app push notifications and other messaging services in order to promote our platform,
inform customers of our product offering and/or the status of their transactions. Changes in how webmail services
organize and prioritize e-mails could reduce the number of customers opening our e-mails. For example, several
service providers organize incoming e-mails into categories. Such tools and features could result in our e-mails
and other messages being shown as “spam”, “junk” or otherwise as lower-priority messages to our customers,
which could reduce the likelihood of customers opening or responding positively to them. Certain customers may
experience dissatisfaction and cease to use our platform if they perceive themselves to be oversaturated with
advertising campaigns or newsletters or otherwise exposed to social media, e-mail or text message “flooding.”
Our customers may also lack interest in the content of our e-mail messages, or such messages may fail to be
delivered or may be delayed in their delivery for technical reasons.

34


-----

Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on, or charge for the delivery of, e-mails, app push
notifications and other messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages
or imposing additional requirements on our ability to conduct e-mail marketing, could impair our ability to
communicate with our customers. In addition, any malfunction of our communication services could result in
erroneous messages being sent and customers no longer wanting to receive any messages from us. Furthermore,
our process to obtain consent from users of our apps and visitors to our websites to receive newsletters, app push
notifications and other messages from us and to allow us to use their data may be deemed insufficient or invalid
by some users. As a result, such individuals or third parties may accuse us of sending unsolicited advertisements
and other messages, which could materialize in claims against us.

There can be no assurance that our assumptions regarding marketing strategies, required customer acquisition
investment and resulting revenue from such customers, including those relating to the effectiveness of our
marketing expenditures, will prove to be correct or lead to increased sales. Also, while we attach the highest
importance to our brand partner relationships and therefore to brand protection, our paid customer acquisition
activities may not be met with approval by all brand partners and lead to an adverse effect on our relationships.
Failure to implement our marketing strategies, or their failure to result in increased sales, could have an adverse
effect on our liquidity, financial position, and results of operations and on the implementation of our growth
strategy.

**_Operational disruptions at our fulfillment centers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

We currently operate two fulfillment centers in Poing, Germany and Suchelów, Poland. We have two additional
warehouses in Brieselang and Großbeeren that will close in the third quarter of 2024 and will be replaced by a
new warehouse in Slubice, Poland. Our fulfillment centers are critical to our business. If operations at our
fulfillment centers were interrupted due to factors including, but not limited to, natural disasters (such as flooding
or fire), man-made disruptions (such as labor strikes), technical defects, accidents, epidemics or any other reason,
it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition,
although since 2019 we outsourced our returns’ handling to a third-party provider in Poland, due to the high level
of integration between our fulfillment centers and points of sale, any interruption of logistics at our fulfillment
center would also have a significant adverse effect on our ability to supply our customers and could result in
customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation. Any disruptions at our sites, either due to problems with our
supply of merchandise or any of the other reasons aforementioned, could also have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_If we are unable to price our products competitively, our business, financial condition and results of operations_**
**_could be negatively impacted._**

As our business model is focused on selling branded fashion products at reduced prices, the price at which we
offer our products is the most important factor for being competitive in our market. Price is of great importance
to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of
digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us
to maintain competitive prices. Our current and potential future competitors may be able to secure more favorable
pricing terms from brand partners, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or otherwise offer similar merchandise
at more attractive prices. If we offer products at higher prices than our competitors, our customers may choose to
shop with our competitors, which could result in a loss of customers and revenue. We are therefore dependent on
the performance of our sourcing and pricing processes, including on our pricing solution, to provide the right
pricing recommendations. We currently price our inventory through a combination of manual initial pricing,
followed by automatic adjustment through the use of an algorithm. Poor pricing decisions could lead to offering
items at prices that are too low or pricing items uncompetitively high. Furthermore, retailers and brands set their
own retail prices for consumers, which can include promotional and sales period discounts. Such discounts by
these parties may adversely affect the relative value of overstock offered for sale with us. In order to attract buyers
to our online platform, the prices for the overstock merchandise we sell may need to be lowered in order to
compete with discounted pricing employed by retailers and brands for the items sold directly by them (which we
refer to as “discount aggressiveness”).

Our prices also depend in part on our sourcing and logistics costs which in turn depend on the development of
prices for certain raw materials, in particular certain textile raw materials, as well as fuel. We are typically also
impacted by carrier-charge increases, as our brand partners and third-party service providers attempt to pass along
these increases to us. Although we may attempt to pass on cost increases to our customers by increasing selling
prices through regular price reviews and adjustments, this might impact our profitability. Moreover, any price

35


-----

increases could adversely affect our sales and, to the extent a decision to increase discount rates in order to remain
competitive in the market is required, it could further reduce our profitability. During periods of declining input
or fuel prices, customer demand may also require that we sell our products at lower prices or may restrict our
ability to increase prices, in spite of the fact that we may use goods that were purchased at higher prices or that
we are forced to incur higher shipping costs, thereby negatively impacting our margins. The volatility in our
sourcing and logistics costs and our limited ability to pass them on to customers may adversely affect our business
and financial condition.

**_We source the majority of our merchandise on the basis of purchase orders with our brand partners, and the_**
**_lack of formal supply agreements could impact our ability to maintain these relationships._**

Consistent with customary practice in our industry, we only enter into long-term agreements with brand partners
in exceptional cases and, therefore, our relationships with many of our brand partners are not based on formalized
supply agreements but, rather, the regular submission of purchase orders or price agreements renegotiated
periodically between the parties on order forms. The lack of these formal, long-term agreements may result in a
less precise definition of the parties’ respective rights and may, in the event of a disagreement between the parties
as it pertains to the terms of the purchase and supply of merchandise, result in disputes or conflicts which may
adversely impact our ability to continue sourcing a particular brand or from a particular brand partner, although
we have recently introduced general terms and conditions, terms of delivery and chemical restrictions as part of
our ongoing relationships with certain brand partners following a brand clustering approach in order to reduce the
risks typically associated to this contracting model.

**_We are subject to certain risks in connection with the quality and timely delivery of our pre-order private label_**
**_merchandise and our relationships with the manufacturers of such merchandise._**

A small share of our sales relates to our private label merchandise, which we source, for example, from suppliers
in Turkey, Spain, Portugal, India, and China. These suppliers may also manufacture merchandise for our
competitors. Our agreements with the manufacturers of our private label merchandise, which set forth the
production and delivery of private label merchandise, are typically based on an order-by-order concept for each
private label brand, rather than long-term supply agreements. In case an agreement with a private label supplier is
terminated, there can be no assurance that we will find other suppliers that will be able to produce comparable
replacement merchandise for us at competitive prices or at all.

Since we only have limited control over manufacturers of our private label merchandise, there is no guarantee that
this merchandise will continue to meet our specifications. Furthermore, any breach or perceived breach of relevant
laws, regulations, permits, or licenses relating to the private label merchandise sold by us, or failure to achieve or
maintain particular ethical business practices and standards, including with respect to environmental, social, and
corporate governance (“ESG”) matters, could also lead to adverse publicity, which could in turn materially
adversely affect the reputation of our private label brands, or even the Group, damage our customer relationships
and lead to a decline in our sales.

As we are the “responsible person” for our private label merchandise within the context of the regulations on
product safety applicable to our merchandise in the jurisdictions in which we operate, any quality defect could
lead to customer claims, administrative or criminal proceedings and, potentially, penalties. We could also face
damage to our own private label brands’ reputation.

**_Our operations may be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected as a result of failures in our IT systems._**

Our success depends on the continuous and uninterrupted availability of our IT systems, particularly to process
customer transactions and to manage inventory levels, purchases and deliveries of our merchandise. Over the past
few years, we have developed a sophisticated IT system which supports our apps and websites, customer service,
supplier connectivity, communications and the monitoring of customer sales and improved management of
inventories. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we need to continuously improve and upgrade
our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of user-enhanced services, features and
functionalities, while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure.

A range of factors beyond our control, such as telecommunication problems, software errors, inadequate capacity
at IT centers, fire, power outages or damage, attacks by third parties, computer viruses and the delayed or failed
implementation of new computer systems, could interfere with the availability of our IT systems. Any material
disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to purchases of
merchandise, to be lost or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to customers or lost

36


-----

sales or impair our ability to manage our inventories. Our existing safety systems, data backup, access protection,
user management and IT emergency planning may not be sufficient to prevent information loss or disruptions to
our IT systems. In addition, if changes in technology cause our IT systems to become obsolete, or if our IT systems
are inadequate to handle our growth, our reputation among our customers may be damaged. Any failure to properly
guard against the interruption or malfunctioning of our IT systems could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to secure or preserve the value of our brand partners’ brand equity could negatively impact our_**
**_financial results._**

We depend on our relationships with, and the supply of merchandise from, our brand partners. To maintain these
relationships and ensure a supply of merchandise from our brand partners, we must secure and preserve the
commercial value that derives from consumer perception of the merchandise produced by such brand partners
(i.e., their brand equity). Brand equity is based on a variety of factors, including level of public awareness of a
brand, quality perceptions regarding the brand and the perception of exclusivity surrounding the brand. The brand
equity of our brand partners could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, such as lowered customer
perceptions of brand value or exclusivity due to their brands being offered through off-price online platforms,
including our BestSecret online platform.

Negative publicity, including, but not limited to, negative online reviews on social media from dissatisfied
customers or media reports related to our offering whether or not accurate, can deter other potential customers
from using our e-commerce platform and lead to a negative impact on the value of the brand equity of our brand
partners through their association with our platform.

If our brand partners perceive a negative impact on their brand equity as a result of their partnership with us, they
may choose to lower the amount of merchandise they make available to us for purchase or terminate their
partnership with us entirely, which could have an adverse material effect on the attractiveness of our offering to
our customers and consequently on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our strategy to continue to expand our business in Germany and internationally may fail or advance at a_**
**_slower pace than planned._**

The success of our online growth in existing markets and expansion into new markets may be affected if we fail
to adapt our offering to local consumer requirements, if we fail to source sufficient merchandise to attract new
customers and retain existing customers or if we fail to adequately scale the supporting operational infrastructure.

The success of our expansion may also be affected if we fail to correctly estimate customer demand in local
markets. This risk may be higher in new markets in which we operate, where our less established position makes
it more difficult to assess customer demand and the appeal of our product offering. Our capital and other
expenditures may also be higher than expected due to cost overruns, unexpected delays, or other unforeseen
factors. In addition, if we fail to execute our expansion strategy in a discreet manner, our brand partner
relationships may deteriorate, and we may lose certain brand partners. If our expansion strategy is not successful
or advances at a slower pace than planned, our competitive position and our profitability and growth may be
negatively affected. In addition, any failure by us to anticipate or respond to market demand, control our operating
costs, or otherwise effectively address any challenges that arise as we attempt to implement our strategy, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to manage our growing business activities effectively._**

Our business has grown significantly over the last decade, and we plan to continue to expand our business.
However, our historical growth may not be indicative of our future performance. As we implement our growth
strategy, operating complexity will increase and will require a continuous expansion and improvement of our
operating capabilities, in addition to further training and management of our employees. Developing and refining
the appropriate processes necessitated by our growth and our increasingly complex group structure, such as
internal management, accounting and book-keeping processes, organizational compliance and risk monitoring
structures, places high demands on us and our management, as well as on our operational and financial
infrastructure, with no assurance that profitability will increase accordingly. As our operations grow further, we
will need to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to deal with the greater scale and
complexity of operations. We will also need to be able to purchase more off-price products for us to offer and are,
therefore, dependent on sufficient overproduction from brand partners and their willingness to sell their products
to us. Any delay in improving these processes or reaching an appropriate level of staffing may result in business

and administrative oversights and errors, which may also lead to higher operating expenses. If we are unable to
achieve any or all of the foregoing, we could fail to take full or partial advantage of growth opportunities available
to us, and as a result, our business would grow at a slower rate than may otherwise be possible.

In addition, our growth could make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will need to make
in the future. This growth could also impact the operational flexibility of the supply chain organization and impair
our ability to react promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends. If we do not make the
necessary capital or other expenditures to accommodate our future growth, we may not be successful in our growth
strategy. Continued growth may also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers, may
impede our efforts to attract, train, motivate and retain employees, or complicate our plans to develop and improve
our operational, financial and management controls. Specifically, in certain regions, continued growth could result
in our business, including fulfillment services sourced from third parties, being unable to accommodate the
number of customers or orders (e.g., if our service providers’ fulfillment centers begin to operate at or near
capacity). As a result, due to the increasing levels of utilization of our Poing, Germany fulfillment and returns
centers, we have added a second fulfillment center in Suchelów, Poland, providing us with additional flexibility
and addressing additional future growth. Any unexpected delays in the ramping up of the new fulfillment center
to fully scaled operations, including as a result of delays in or failure to obtain any further financing to fund this
expansion, could harm our ability to scale the business as planned and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our growing business will also lead to an increase in logistical complexity as well as shipping and fulfillment
center costs. Increased logistical complexity contains the risk that it will be more challenging to maintain our
operations at the current level and that more unforeseen interruptions and issues could arise that in turn lead to
higher shipping and fulfillment center costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

We may be unable to accurately anticipate all the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our
business, personnel, systems and controls and procedures, and the failure to appropriately address such demands,
or the realization of any of the above-mentioned risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial position.

**_Our compliance management system and internal controls may not be sufficient to adequately protect us from_**
**_all legal or financial risks, especially with regards to our business in certain countries where corruption and_**
**_money laundering may be considered widespread._**

To protect us against legal risks and other potential harm, we established a group-wide, centralized compliance
management system that comprises several specific compliance programs (e.g., anti-corruption, anti-money
laundering, fraud prevention and conflict of interest, economic sanctions compliance and antitrust as well as
human rights), including a group-wide Code of Conduct which outlines the general rules of behavior for our
management and employees, as well as our business ethics. Our central compliance function is carried out by our
compliance department, legal department and our managing directors and is complemented by external law firms.
Direct reporting lines to the management board and our parent company’s supervisory board are set up. Yet, these
codes, guidelines and policies and the oversight of our internal compliance and legal departments might not be
sufficient to prevent all unauthorized practices, legal infringements, corruption, and fraud—especially regarding
purchasing practices—or other adverse consequences of non-compliance within our organization or by or on
behalf of our employees or third parties. Any compliance failure could harm our reputation and have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

To comply with legal requirements as well as to achieve our corporate goals efficiently and effectively, as an
integrated part of the Corporate Governance structure, we have established a formally documented, tool-based
group-wide risk management system. Having a well-defined and uniform risk management system in place allows
us to recognize, assess, manage and monitor risks that might potentially threaten our operations now and in the
future. Through early detection of risk-related issues and implementation of suitable countermeasures we
minimize our risk exposure. Our central risk management is carried out by the risk manager, who represents the
link between the risk owners, managing directors and our parent company’s supervisory board, and continuously
develops and improves our risk management system to ensure its completeness and correctness. However, as we
operate in a very dynamic environment, our risk management system and periodical risk assessment might not be
sufficient to ensure that all potential events impacting our organization are timely identified and promptly
mitigated, also due to risks characteristic that their probability of occurrence and potential impact on organization
cannot be determined with certainty.

38


-----

To identify, monitor and control internal risks related to our business processes we established a group-wide
internal control system pursuant to which we use a dedicated governance, risk and compliance software to
document the risks and corresponding controls for all relevant business processes, with a particular focus on those
processes located at the interface with external parties, such as merchandise buying. Nevertheless, our current
internal controls, prevention (such as our anti-corruption policy) and training programs may prove to be
insufficient.

Despite our internal control systems, our employees, agents or authorized persons may have been engaged or may
from time to time be engaged in activities for which we could be held liable on different legal grounds. For
example, we conduct business in, and may expand our business to, certain countries where corruption may be
considered to be widespread. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that our employees, agents or other authorized
persons could make payments or grant hidden benefits in violation of applicable anti-corruption laws and
regulations, especially in response to demands or attempts by individuals or entities to procure an illicit monetary
benefit.

Most laws and regulations promulgated against corruption and money laundering require us to implement certain
controls, procedures, and internal regulations in order to ensure that the operations of a given entity do not involve
corruption, illegal payments, or money-laundering. Although we engage in know-your-customer activities, the
great diversity and complexity of these local laws and regulations and the expansive nature of the business
conducted by us in various countries and markets create a risk that we may nevertheless be deemed liable for
violations of local laws and regulations.

Any violation or breach of these laws and regulations could affect our overall reputation and, depending on the
case, expose us to administrative, criminal or civil proceedings, which could result in criminal and administrative
fines and sanctions, confiscations and asset forfeitures, including possible prohibitions on maintaining business
relationships with brand partners, fashion or lifestyle brands or customers in certain countries, which could in turn
have material adverse effects on the implementation of our business strategy as well as on our financial condition.

**_We are subject to numerous laws and regulations with respect to data protection and failure to comply with_**
**_such laws and regulations may result in litigation and administrative or arbitration proceedings and/or_**
**_significantly damage our relationship with our customers._**

We process sensitive customer data as part of our members-only business model. A fundamental requirement for
online commerce and communications is the secure handling and transmission of confidential information over
public networks. However, we cannot exclude that any advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the
field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the systems we use to protect
transactional and personal data.

Additionally, we are subject to a host of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and
security of this personal data, including the GDPR, which is effective since May 25, 2018, as well as other
applicable laws. Under the GDPR, we, as a data controller, must implement certain specific technical and
organizational measures to protect the personal data we collect depending on the amount of and potential risk for
the personal data processed. In order to comply with the GDPR, we have implemented a data protection
organization and, among other actions, we have appointed an external data protection officer. These data
protection organizations, together with the external data protection officer, monitor all of our measures associated
with data protection, including group-wide training for existing and new employees.

Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate
applicable privacy and data security laws, including the GDPR, as well as other applicable laws, and cause
significant legal and financial risks, adverse publicity, or a loss of confidence in our security measures.
Furthermore, a breach of the GDPR or a failure to comply with other applicable data protection laws or regulations
could lead to us becoming subject to governmental investigations, fines, and private claims for compensation from
individuals whose personal data was involved. In the event of such a personal data breach, we could be required
to notify applicable government authorities (within a certain time period) and/or potential victims if the breach in
question may pose a high risk to the rights of these victims. This could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial position (for example, the GDPR provides severe fines in case of
infringements of up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover on a group basis, whichever is greater and depending
on the respective breach for non-compliance with GDPR provisions). The need to comply with data protection
legislation conveys significant controlling, operational and reputational risks which could affect us in a number
of ways including, for example, by making it more difficult to maintain and expand our marketing database and
also by giving rise to potential litigation relating to alleged misuse of personal data. While we have taken out

39


-----

cyber-security insurance, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage concerning this and other risks will
cover any liabilities that we might actually incur fully, partially or at all, or that such insurance will continue to
be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.

New and more stringent data protection laws, regulations or developments and changes in consumer behavior
could interfere with our strategies to use privacy-related information for our marketing efforts and could also have
an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Current case law may also require us to change our current data protection strategies. For example, the “Schrems
II” ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union of July 16, 2020, provides that special care and safeguards
must be taken when transferring personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA. This decision has greatly
increased the legal requirements imposed on data exporters for transfers of personal data from EU-countries to
non-EU countries, which are deemed to have an inadequate data protection level compared to the standards
imposed in the EEA (including, amongst others, the United States). Ensuring compliance with changing and/or
stricter standards requires resources to continuously review and, as necessary, replace, amend, or supplement the
international data transfer mechanisms which we currently rely on, including corporate binding rules, standard
contractual clauses, and adequate data processing agreements with our business partners. The resulting
mechanisms and procedures may increase the expenses associated with our overall compliance with personal data
protection requirements or even require us to discontinue using certain tools that are relevant to our business. Any
non-compliance, including as a result of our use of Google Analytics and Amazon Web Services, could result in
potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions,
and damage to our reputation. In this context, uncertainty remains as it pertains to transfers of personal data from
the EEA to the United States and certain other “non-adequate” jurisdictions. The EU-U.S. Data Privacy
Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”) was developed to facilitate transatlantic commerce by providing U.S. organizations
with reliable mechanisms for personal data transfers to the United States from the EU / EEA that were consistent
with EU data privacy laws. The EU-U.S. DPF aims to rectify the deficiencies identified by the CJEU when it
invalidated its predecessor (the “Privacy Shield”) in the “Schrems II” ruling, by introducing enhanced safeguards
and more stringent requirements to curtail U.S. surveillance access to EU residents’ data. However, it is likely
that the EU-U.S. DPF will be challenged before the CJEU, and potentially struck, resulting in further changes to
the data privacy background in the context of transfer of personal data from EU countries. Against this
background, the European Commission successfully concluded its review of 11 existing adequacy decisions
adopted under the EU data protection legislation that preceded the GDPR on January 15, 2024. The European
Commission found that personal data transferred from the EU to Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands,
Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Israel, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay, continues to benefit from
adequate data protection safeguards. Therefore, the adequacy decisions adopted for these eleven countries and
territories remain in place and data can continue to flow freely to these jurisdictions. However, while the European
Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the U.K. on June 28, 2021, allowing the continued flow of personal
data from the EEA to the U.K., this decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European
Commission re-assesses and renews or extends it. The decision will be regularly reviewed by the European
Commission going forward and may be revoked if the U.K. diverges from its current data protection laws and the
European Commission deems the U.K. to no longer provide adequate protection of personal data. Were the EUU.S. DPF be declared invalid following judicial review by the CJEU, the U.K.’s adequacy decision not be renewed
or extended or any other third-parties or territories be deemed to have non-adequate data protection measures
under “Schrems II” or otherwise, we may be required to make further modifications to our practices and policies,
potentially involving significant additional costs.

Furthermore, existing, and future decisions by local governmental regulators may also impact the application of
the GDPR. For example, in January 2022, the Austrian Data Protection Authority issued a decision that a
company’s use of Google Analytics contravenes the GDPR with regard to potential data transfers to the
US. Complying with such decisions could impose further costs on us and limit our ability to use data analytics
software to support our operations.

Additionally, significant modifications in other data protection laws or regulations in countries in which we
operate may consequently lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices. Compliance
will become more complex and involve higher costs and the increasing risk of noncompliance may give rise to
civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief), fines or even criminal charges.

Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber security breaches as a result of human error, external
hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches or physical security
breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access. If we or any third-party service providers on
which we may rely fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, or if any such loss of personal

40


-----

customer data were otherwise to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws. Any such disclosure
could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites and deter future purchases.

Any failure to comply with local and international laws governing personal data or to protect our data from being
misappropriated could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_We face a risk of theft or misappropriation of funds and products in our stores and our fulfillment centers._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we have been in the past, and in the future may be, exposed to a risk of
theft of merchandise in our stores. Merchandise has and may in the future continue to also be misappropriated
during transportation or at our fulfillment centers and those of our logistic partners. In addition, we have and may
in the future continue to experience a misappropriation of funds in our stores or at other levels of our business.

**_Our user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and inaccuracies in_**
**_those metrics could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition._**

We regularly review metrics, including but not limited to active users, new customers and average order value,
frequency, and quantity, to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. These
metrics are calculated using internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party and
the metrics have not been validated by an independent third party. Our internal systems and tools have a number
of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in
unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose on an ongoing basis. If the internal
systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or over count performance or contain algorithmic or
other technical errors, the data we present may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe
to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges
in measuring how our platform is used. Errors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could result in incorrect
business decisions and inefficiencies.

For example, as it pertains to our active users metric, there are individuals who have multiple accounts on our
platform. A user is separately identified on our platform by a unique e-mail address; therefore, a single person
with multiple registered accounts could be counted as multiple distinct users for purposes of this metric. If a
significant understatement or overstatement of active users were to occur, we may expend resources to implement
unnecessary business measures or fail to take required actions to attract enough users to satisfy our growth
strategies.

Further, certain other information we collect from users, including personal data, is self-reported and may differ
from actual data. For example, age and other demographic information may be inaccurate if our users provide us
with incorrect or incomplete information regarding their age or other attributes or choose not to report this
information. If there were material inaccuracies in our user demographic metrics, it would result in the inefficient
allocation of our marketing budget or resources, which could seriously harm our business.

**_Changes in customer return rates might increase our costs and harm our business._**

We have established return policies that permit our customers to return products within designated timeframes
ranging from 14 to 30 days, depending on their membership status (30 days for Diamond customers, 21 days for
Gold and 14 days for all others). Granting return rights is an important element for converting app and website
visitors into customers, by providing our customers with the certainty that they will only be required to pay for
those products that they want to keep. Moreover, we have a customer-friendly returns policy. It is possible that,
in the future, a growing number of customers may abuse our returns policy and, for example, buy merchandise
just to wear it once at a party and then return it, claiming it had arrived used. We generally experience a higher
return rate from customers who pay for our merchandise with invoices (in lieu of using standard payment
platforms). Our failure to prevent abuse of our returns policy or to otherwise manage our returns policy effectively
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

Certain of our online customers, including online customers in Germany, have statutory rights with respect to the
return of merchandise. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience a significant increase in returns—
for example, due to customer dissatisfaction with our products or customer service, changes in customer behavior,
decrease in purchasing power due to inflationary pressures or the abuse of our liberal return policy by persons not
actually willing to purchase our products. In these cases, we incur costs associated with returned goods, including
costs associated with return processing and delivery, but may not be able to generate revenue from returned
merchandise or, alternatively, if we generate revenue, the proceeds may not cover all costs incurred. In addition,

41


-----

we bear the risk for damage or loss of the returned merchandise. Thus, any increase in returns would potentially
increase our costs without a proportionate increase in revenue.

Continued growth is likely to increase the absolute number of returns, which may force us to allocate additional
resources to the handling of such returns, may further complicate our operations and heighten the impact of the
abovementioned risks associated to return volumes. Furthermore, any modifications to our return policies may
result in customer dissatisfaction, which could harm our reputation, or lead to an increase in the number of returns,
which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation._**

There has been increased focus, by consumers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders, as well as by
governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social and governance matters (“ESG”)
generally and regarding the fashion industry specifically.

Any failure by us to meet our ESG commitments or targets, or loss of confidence, or inability to meet expectations
with our ESG commitments on the part of customers, investors, employees, brand partners, and other stakeholders
as it relates to our ESG initiatives could negatively impact our brand, our brand partner relationships, and the
demand for our offerings. These impacts could be difficult and costly to overcome, even if such concerns were
based on inaccurate or misleading information. Furthermore, while we believe we have an inherently sustainable
business model (as most of the articles we sell are overstock and our model aims to ensure that every piece of
fashion that has been produced and is fit-to-wear finds an owner), it is possible that our model will not be perceived
as sustainable by customers, investors, employees, brand partners, and other stakeholders. If we fail, or are
perceived to fail, to meet applicable standards or expectations with respect to ESG issues, including the
expectations we set for ourselves, or if stakeholders’ perceptions of the sustainability of our model are negative,
this could also negatively impact our business and reputation as a result of negative allegations or litigation and
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. For example, as
stakeholder perceptions of sustainability continue to evolve, there have been increasing allegations of
greenwashing against companies making significant ESG claims due to a variety of perceived deficiencies in
performance. Furthermore, advertising (including ESG advertising) to consumers is subject to a complex
legislative and regulatory landscape which, in our case, includes, at a transnational level, the European Green Deal
and, at a local level, Germany’s harmonized Law against Unfair Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren
_Wettbewerb; “UWG”), with regulatory agencies and competition and consumer protection organizations_
increasingly pursuing litigation against companies deemed to incur in greenwashing. For example, the German
Centre for Protection against Unfair Competition (Wettbewerbszentrale) has successfully litigated several
proceedings on the basis that companies have made misleading statements as to their “environmentally neutral”
status. These proceedings have resulted in the development of strict court standards which may in the future be
applied to climate-related claims in addition to environmental neutrality. As part of the European Green Deal, an
EU-wide set of rules regarding green claims vis-à-vis consumers has been, or is close to being adopted in the form
of Directive (EU) 2024/825 as regards empowering consumers for the green transition and of the draft Directive
on substantiation and communication of explicit environmental claims (Green Claims Directive). Current, and
any future, legal developments in this area may therefore result in our increased exposure to litigation and any
associated liability, as well as to authority orders and significant administrative fines, whether in the context of
misleading ESG advertising or otherwise, which could in turn affect our reputation and negatively impact our
results of operations and financial prospects.

In addition, achieving our ESG initiatives and/or meeting respective legal requirements may result in increased
costs in our supply chain, fulfillment, and/or corporate business operations. Standards regarding environmental,
social, and governance initiatives could change and become more onerous for both for us and our third-party brand
partners to meet successfully. For example, in January 2023, the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability
Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) took effect. This directive, as implemented by forthcoming European Union
Member State legislation, will result in various sustainability disclosures being provided by various entities, on a
phased basis, with the first entities in scope from January 1, 2024, reporting in 2025. We are considered a large
undertaking under CSRD and are, therefore, required to report on certain sustainability requirements for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2025. We expect that the significant new sustainability disclosures under the CSRD
will impact us directly and indirectly and result in increased costs and potentially impact our business or reputation
to the extent our disclosures are deemed inadequate or false and misleading. In addition, the Corporate
Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) has been formally adopted by the European Parliament on
April 24, 2024, and by the Council of the European Union on May 24, 2024. Upon publication in the Official
Journal of the European Union, the CSDDD will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication.
The directive aims at providing a harmonized legal framework for sustainability considerations in the supply chain

42


-----

of European companies. Among other things, it will establish a corporate due diligence duty, which is aimed at
ending, preventing, mitigating, and accounting for negative human rights and environmental impacts in a
company’s own operations, including subsidiaries, and their value chains. The CSDDD will be rolled out in
phases, depending on the number of employees and net worldwide turnover. Five years after entry into force of
the directive, it will apply to companies that had more than 1,000 employees and a net worldwide turnover above
€450 million in the last fiscal year. The CSDDD still needs to be transposed into national law of the EU Member
States. As a result, there remains uncertainty as to the potential impact of this new regime on us. For example, we
expect that the transposition of the CSDDD into German law will affect the German Supply Chain Due Diligence
Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz) (“LkSG”), which regulates certain due diligence obligations for
companies in the supply chain and entered into force on January 1, 2023 (and became applicable to us on January
1, 2024). In light thereof, among other measures, we recently implemented a supplier code of conduct that seeks
to comply with the mandates of the LkSG we may be subject to additional compliance costs and dedication of
resources in the future to the extent we have to modify our supplier code of conduct, our agreements with suppliers
and any related internal controls, procedures and IT tools to fully align with the requirements of the CSDDD.
Additionally, on June 29, 2023, the EU Deforestation Regulation (“EUDR”) came into force, which places
obligations on companies trading in cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya and wood, as well as many
products derived from these commodities, to conduct extensive diligence on the value chain to ensure the goods
do not result from recent deforestation, forest degradation or breaches of local environmental and social laws
starting on December 30, 2024. To the extent that we trade in products covered by the EUDR, such as products
containing wood, we may be required to further update our internal controls on our value chain, including our
supplier code of conduct and our agreements with suppliers to ensure compliance. Furthermore, there is a risk that
we will not be able to market and sell the affected products should we fail to comply with the requirements of the
EUDR by December 31, 2024. Although we believe that the impact of this risk on our Group is limited, we cannot
guarantee that any amendments to the provision or the promulgation of other, similar provisions, will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these
assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well
in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the
importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments
include, among others, a company’s efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and
compliance with law and the role of a company’s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues.
In light of investors’ increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues
successfully, or that we will successfully meet society’s and investors’ ESG expectations or achieve our financial
goals. As part of our commitment to ESG matters, we are planning to introduce specific, quantifiable key
performance indicators. If we fail to meet the targets of these or other key performance indicators, we may suffer
reputational damage, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

**_Dissatisfaction with our convenience proposition could negatively affect our customer retention and the_**
**_implementation of our growth strategy._**

A satisfied, loyal customer base is crucial for our ongoing expansion. Based on our members-only business model,
attracting new customers depends in part on word-of-mouth and the recommendations of existing customers to
expand our customer base. We therefore must ensure that existing customers are satisfied with our convenience
proposition, including content creation, usability of our online platform and app, check-out process, payment
options, packaging and shipping and customer service, so that those customers continue to recommend us. Should
our efforts to satisfy existing customers be unsuccessful, we may fail to continue expanding our business or may
be obliged to incur significant marketing and development expenditure to attract new customers.

For example, reliable customer support is vital to ensure that customer complaints are processed within
appropriate timeframes and under satisfactory conditions. Providing this support requires that our customer
support personnel have fashion, retail, technical, and other necessary knowledge and expertise, making it difficult
for us to hire qualified personnel and scale our support operations. The demand on our customer service
organization will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers, and such increased support could
require us to devote significant development services and support personnel to our customer service teams, which
could strain our team and infrastructure and reduce our profit margins. Any absence of a response or an
unsatisfactory response to customer queries or complaints, whether founded or perceived as such, may have a
detrimental impact on customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as our reputation, particularly if customers make
negative comments on blogs, social media, or through online ratings and reviews. We may not be able to verify
or adequately respond to such negative comments, ratings or reviews. An inability to retain customers and earn

43


-----

their loyalty, or to identify, follow up and respond to customer complaints and online comments due to customer
service failings, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks associated to the payment options we offer._**

We currently offer different payment methods tailored to meet our customers’ payment preferences, including
cards, PayPal and purchase by invoice. We face the risk of operational failures during the check-out process in
our e-commerce platform as well as our retail stores relating to the complexity of certain payment methods. Such
difficulties could adversely affect our conversion rate which is the proportion of site visitors that actually complete
the purchasing process. We may also become subject to additional or changing regulations regarding certain
payment methods, such as the operating rules and certification requirements of payment scheme associations and
rules governing electronic funds transfers, which apply to payment cards, whether in general or in a particular
country in which we operate. We may also become subject to more stringent or complex compliance requirements,
for example with respect to our vouchers. For the processing of all our current payment methods we pay different
fees to our payment method providers. It is possible that some of these fees would increase over time, causing our
expenses to rise. In the case of invoice payments, even though the default risk currently lies with our service
provider, a high non-payment rate will lead to either increased costs for us or a lowered acceptance rate for
customers using this payment method. Furthermore, different payment options have different costs to us (e.g.,
PayPal is much more expensive than purchase by invoice) and should customers shift their preferences in favor
of the more expensive payment methods, then our expenses would rise accordingly.

Furthermore, various types of fraud committed through payments may increase our overall cost. These types of
fraud vary, and range from account take-overs, usage of stolen credit cards, fake identities, fake bank accounts, to
“almost legal fraud” like voucher abusing or the creation of multiple accounts to take advantage of our loyalty
system. In case of excessive fraud events relating to credit card transactions, in addition to the direct losses, we
could enter the card schemes’ chargeback monitoring programs, where we could incur extra fees and even lose
the right to accept cards altogether.

For online payments, primary liability for fraud generally lies with the party with the lowest security standards,
which, in most cases, is the merchant. While strong authentication methods such as two-factor authentication, can
help us alleviate some of this risk, we consciously elect to forego the strongest authentication methods because
the added hurdle for the customer would detract from a seamless customer experience. Further, some payment
methods, such as unsecured direct debits, have by design no authorization mechanism and thus we bear significant
risk. Failure to adequately balance a seamless and streamlined customer experience with adequate security and
anti-fraud protections could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_We might be exposed to tax risks or tax liabilities resulting from deviating interpretations of applicable tax laws_**
**_or tax audits or a challenge of the transfer pricing model by the tax authorities._**

We are subject to routine tax field audit (Außenprüfung) by local tax authorities (i.e., _Finanzamt Abt._
_Körperschaften) in Munich. This audit for the years 2018 to 2021 commenced in November 2023 by introducing_
a catalog of questions. The audit includes all German entities of the BestSecret Group. Furthermore, tax audits for
periods or jurisdictions not yet subject to a tax audit may exceed the taxes already paid by us or reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, we may be required to make additional tax payments with respect
to previous periods. Moreover, the competent tax authorities could revise their original tax assessments. Any tax
assessments that deviate from our expectations could lead to an increase in our tax burden. In addition, we may
be required to pay interest on these additional taxes as well as late filing penalties. Furthermore, we have carried
out reorganizations of the Group structure, and there is a risk that any such restructuring could attract additional
tax scrutiny or result in a tax leakage despite our best efforts to avoid such negative tax consequences (e.g.,
obtaining tax advisory services by reputable consultants who confirmed the tax neutrality of the Group structure
reorganizations).

Due to our operations in various jurisdictions, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, the
Netherlands, Poland and Spain, we are exposed to various tax risks, including risks based on transfer pricing rules
which apply to cross-border business relationships, for example, purchase, logistics, distribution or commission
agreements or other arrangements. Pursuant to such transfer pricing rules, related enterprises are required to
conduct any inter-company transactions on terms which would also apply among unrelated third parties
concluding comparable agreements (so-called “arm’s length principle”) and to sufficiently document the relevant
transactions. One or more tax authorities might not agree with, and thus challenge the cross-jurisdictional transfer
pricing model we implemented. For example, our documentation may be considered to be insufficient by the

44


-----

relevant tax authorities or transfer prices may be considered to be inadequate or inadequately justified. This may
result in double taxation in two or more jurisdictions and penalties. Moreover, transfer pricing risks may increase
in the future in case our intra-group cross-border business grows or changes or if tax authorities change their
interpretation of applicable transfer pricing rules.

Furthermore, the documentation obligations under applicable value-added tax (“VAT”) and VAT-related laws are
considerable. Overall, it cannot be ruled out that the competent tax authorities may interpret the tax law (now or
in the future) in a way that suggests that we may not fully comply, or, as the case may be, may have not fully
complied with applicable VAT regulations throughout all phases of their development. Any additional tax
payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Application of international tax laws on our international operations may expose us to potentially adverse tax_**
**_consequences._**

As a result of our international operations and business, we are subject to tax laws in several jurisdictions, in
particular, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. We are also
subject to transfer pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies pursuant to,
for example, purchase, logistics, distribution or commission agreements or other arrangements. Adverse
developments in the tax laws or regulations in these jurisdictions, or any change in position by the relevant
authority regarding the application, administration or interpretation of tax laws or regulations in any applicable
jurisdiction, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We depend on qualified personnel, including certain key personnel such as our senior management, as well_**
**_as, our external employees, and may not be able to retain or replace such personnel._**

Our success and future growth depend significantly on the performance of our senior management and qualified
personnel in certain functions, including but not limited to IT, tech, data, purchasing and logistics as well as
merchandising. In addition, a certain proportion of our personnel working on technology related matters are
classed as external employees. In the event of departure of one or more of these key and qualified personnel, we
may not be able to replace them quickly, which could affect our operational performance. More generally, we
may be unable to recruit new personnel whose skills and industry experience are equivalent to those of our key
and qualified personnel or could fail to attract and retain experienced personnel in the future. In addition, should
our executives or key employees join a competitor or create a competing business, it could have a negative impact
on our operations. Furthermore, many of our procurement employees have good relationships with brand partners,
many of which have developed over decades. If we are not able to retain these employees, we may fail to maintain
or further develop these relationships with brand partners.

If we fail to attract, train, motivate or retain skilled personnel or if our operations are affected over a longer period
of time by labor disputes or if we are forced to enter into a collective bargaining agreement at unfavorable terms,
this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and our reputation.

**_We are exposed to the risk of rising labor costs as well as work stoppages, strikes or other collective actions._**

Personnel expenses represent a significant part of our cost base. We may face considerable wage increases in the
future, for example in connection with statutory minimum wages, current inflation dynamics or otherwise as a
result of generally rising wages. If we are not successful in limiting such increases in personnel costs, or if cost
increases cannot be passed on to our customers, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

Some of our subsidiaries are bound by collective bargaining agreements (Tarifverträge) or are members of an
employer association (Arbeitgeberverband). For example, Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH are
our only Group companies that are members of an employers’ association, although such membership does not
entail the application of collective bargaining agreements (OT Mitgliedschaft). Additionally, industry-wide
collective bargaining agreements apply in Austria, Italy and Spain. For example, due to mandatory membership
in the Austrian Chamber of Commerce (Wirtschaftskammer), Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH is bound by two
collective bargaining agreements for employees and apprentices in commercial operations. As a result, there can
be no assurance that labor disputes, work stoppages, strikes or similar actions will not occur in the future which
might urge us to adopt or negotiate further collective bargaining agreements. Any material disagreements between
us and our employees could disrupt our operations, lead to a loss in revenue and customers and increase our
operating costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that collective bargaining would be possible on terms that are
satisfactory to us. See—“Our Business—Employees.”

45


-----

In addition, since certain of our operations, including work in our fulfillment centers, are labor intensive,
maintaining good relationships with our employees is crucial to our operations. We have in the past had, and may
in future have, difficulty recruiting employees to work in our fulfillment centers. Any deterioration in our
relationship with our workforce could lead to us or one of our service providers not being able to recruit enough
labor to support our growth even if we increase pay. In October 2022, in connection with the formation of Best
Secret Group SE, a German SE works council was established, which comprises 11 members and is responsible
for cross-border matters and, so long as a national works council for such matters does not exist, national matters
affecting employees in several of the countries in which our Group operates. Except for this works council, no
employee representative bodies are established at any Group company. While we have a supervisory board at the
level of Holdco, no supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) has been established at our main operating companies Best
Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH to date. This may, depending on the development of the employee
base, change in the future and our employees may establish additional works councils and we may be required to
implement a supervisory board at Best Secret GmbH, and/or Best Secret Logistik GmbH according to the German
One-Third Participation Act (Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz) or the German Codetermination Act

(Mitbestimmungsgesetz), as the case may be. As a consequence, we would be required, inter alia, to involve such
bodies in certain decision-making processes, which may limit our operational flexibility and our ability to react
to corporate developments in a timely manner.

Any deterioration of such relationships in the future or any material work stoppages, strikes or other types of
conflicts with our employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position.

**_We face certain risks in relation to future acquisitions._**

We may, from time to time, evaluate certain acquisition opportunities, including acquiring new online fashion
retailers. For example, in 2016 we acquired Swiss Online Shopping AG as part of our expansion into Switzerland,
which, at the time of acquisition and during the following months, was generating losses. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to identify suitable targets and consummate an acquisition on favorable terms or at
all. It is also possible that not all material risks in connection with acquisitions will be identified in the due
diligence process and that such risks will not be taken into account in the decision-making process or the respective
agreements to a sufficient level or at all. In addition, future acquisitions may also entail financial and tax
restructuring measures which, even if designed with the aim of achieving a tax-efficient structure, may expose us
to risks, e.g., if the tax authorities were to challenge any of the implemented measures.

Upon making acquisitions, our performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the
acquired businesses in an efficient manner. Such integration may be a complex, time-consuming and expensive
process and will likely involve a number of risks, including the costs and expenses associated with unexpected
difficulties, initial or ongoing losses in periods following the acquisition, the diversion of management’s attention
from our daily operations, additional demands on management related to the increase in the size and scope of our
operations following an acquisition and any undisclosed liabilities of an acquired company. Even if we are able
to successfully integrate newly-acquired businesses, this integration may not result in the realization of the
synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, operational efficiencies and other benefits that we
expect. We may also incur unexpected liabilities in connection with such acquisitions. If these liabilities are
significant or if we fail to integrate a new acquisition effectively, this could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to a variety of regulations, including but not limited to laws governing data protection, telemedia_**
**_services, consumer protection, foreign trade and customs, packaging, cyber security as well as competition_**
**_laws, and future regulations might impose additional requirements and other obligations on our business._**

We are, or in the future may be, subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to e-commerce or fashion,
as well as laws and regulations of broader application that apply to our business and to public companies generally.
These laws and regulations cover, among other things, data protection, telemedia services, consumer protection,
supply chain risks, textile labeling, packaging, cyber security, taxation, tariffs, anti-bribery and anti-money
laundering, antitrust, pricing and discounting, content, copyrights, trademarks, distribution, mobile, social media
and other communication, advertising practices, electronic contracts, sales procedures, environmental protection,
unencumbered internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and
quality of goods that are offered online. Furthermore, as the internet continues to revolutionize commercial
relationships on a global scale, and as the use of the internet and mobile devices in everyday life becomes ever
more prevalent, these laws continue to evolve at a rapid pace and can differ, or be subject to differing
interpretations, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Existing and future regulations and laws relating to the internet

46


-----

may impede the growth and availability of the internet and online services, inhibit our ability to grow our business,
or adversely affect our business by increasing costs and administrative burdens.

In addition, various legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which
we operate, may extend the scope of current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised
rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection and consumer protection. For example, the European
Commission’s Digital Single Market (“DSM”) initiative is resulting in, and is expected to continue to result in,
additional rules on e-commerce or data protection, information security and privacy, which may increase our
compliance costs or affect our business model.

Furthermore, the EU Taxonomy, as well as the CSRD, will impose reporting requirements regarding targets and
economic activities related to social responsibility and environmental protection. Such legislation will require us
to further adapt our compliance systems to manage new legal and operational risks, which will require us to devote
more resources to our compliance function and could also require us to adapt our business model.

Given the broad variety of applicable rules and their evolving nature, we cannot guarantee that our practices have
complied or will comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations. Any failure, actual or perceived, by us to
comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and a loss of revenue, and
any legal or enforcement action brought against us as a result of actual or alleged non-compliance could further
damage our reputation and result in substantially increased legal expenses. Adverse changes in laws or regulations
applicable to us could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and could
compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy effectively. Any compliance failure may also give rise to
civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief), fines or even criminal charges.

Additionally, the global nature of the internet and telecommunications technology can make it difficult to ensure
that our websites, advertisements, and content remain within the scope of their intended audience. Moreover,
despite our efforts to comply with local regulatory requirements, our websites advertisements and content could
be made available by third parties in areas where their dissemination violates local requirements, and we could
face penalties and damage to our reputation. Finally, certain jurisdictions may attempt to levy novel sales, income,
or other taxes on our internet-based activities. New taxes could increase our cost of doing business and expose us
to penalties. Any such increased costs, penalties, reputational damage, or increased costs associated with
maintaining compliance in different regulatory environments could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_Climate change and related regulatory responses as well as customer awareness may adversely impact our_**
**_business._**

There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns
around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in weather patterns
and an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather conditions could, among other things,
adversely impact our suppliers’ supply chain operations, increase the cost of our suppliers’ products, and impact
the types of products that customers purchase. As a result, the effects of climate change could have an adverse
impact on our business and results of operations.

In many countries, governmental bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to the
potential impacts of climate change. These laws have the potential to impact our operations indirectly as a result
of required compliance by our suppliers and the manufacturers of their products. In addition, we are active in an
industry that is not considered to be environmentally sustainable, and we depend on shipping logistics, which lead
to a high emission of carbon dioxide. As a result, our customers might refuse to acquire merchandise from us and
turn to more sustainable competitors or reduce or refrain from acquiring fashion products. If we take steps to
voluntarily mitigate our impact on climate change, we may experience increases in energy and transportation
costs, capital expenditures or insurance premiums and deductibles. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations
among jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of
the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations, or industry standards, as well as any
international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries
in which we operate or conduct business. In addition, apart from legislative developments we see a growing risk
stemming from emerging climate change litigation globally. The rise of so-called “strategic litigation networks”
that are targeting specific industries with particular forms of litigation while forum shopping in various
jurisdictions constitutes a significant risk for our business that is difficult to assess.

**_Third parties might accuse us of infringing their intellectual property rights._**

The e-commerce industry, as well as the fashion industry in general, is characterized by vigorous protection for
and pursuit of intellectual property rights. We have in the past been, and in the future may be, subject to claims
and allegations of infringement of third parties’ intellectual property rights. Brand and content owners and other
proprietary rights owners have actively asserted their purported rights against online companies, including the
Group. In particular, we have in the past received, and in future may receive, cease-and-desist letters from fashion
brands requesting that we cease importing merchandise that allegedly infringes upon their intellectual property.
Infringement of third parties’ intellectual property rights could subject us to significant liability for damages. Such
claims may in the future result, and have in the past resulted, in our goods being seized by customs authorities as
part of investigations into intellectual property infringement claims. The costs of defending against such actions
can be high, and there is no guarantee that such defenses will be successful. Such actions could also result in the
diversion of our management’s time and attention. Moreover, infringement of third parties’ intellectual property
rights may result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property or in the prohibition of using the
intellectual property at all, subject to the respective claims, unless we are able to enter into agreements with the
intellectual property owners. Furthermore, as our business expands and the number of competitors in our market
increases, infringement claims against us could increase in number and significance. In addition to litigation from
rights owners, we may be subject to regulatory, civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental
authorities believe we have aided and abetted in the sale of counterfeit or other unlawful products. Such claims,
whether or not meritorious, could result in significant additional expenses, redirect management attention, and
have an adverse effect on our reputation as well as on our financial condition.

Legal claims regarding intellectual property rights are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complex issues
involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims. Many
potential litigants have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources than we do to the enforcement of
intellectual property rights and defense of claims that may be brought against them. If successful, a claimant could
secure a judgment against us for substantial damages or prevent us from conducting our business as we have
historically done so or may desire to do so in the future. We could also be required to seek authorization or make
payments in order to use of the intellectual property we need to conduct our business, which we may not be able
to achieve on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be forced to develop non-infringing
intellectual property on a proprietary basis, which could be expensive and/or unsuccessful. We use third-party
software on the basis of software license agreements. We may not have sufficient licenses to cover the actual
scope of use of such software in our business operations, which may require us to pay compensation to, and to
acquire further licenses from, the owners of the rights in the relevant software. In addition, we may be required to
obtain further licenses to enhance our business operations, and we may also be required to change the current
software providers and enter into agreements with new software providers with less favorable terms. This may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Currency volatility may materially adversely affect our business._**

We operate our business in 27 European countries, several of which use currencies other than the euro, and source
our products from various international brand partners, which exposes us to fluctuations between the euro, our
reporting currency, and other currencies, in particular the Polish złoty. In addition, we have commenced the
operation of our second fulfillment center in Suchelów, Poland. We anticipate that this new fulfillment center will
be fully scaled up over the next few years. Once the fulfillment center in Poland achieves fully scaled operations,
we will be increasingly exposed to currency risk. Such risks arise due to fluctuations or devaluations of currencies,
inflation and foreign exchange controls or governmental measures that impact our ability to convert currencies.
In addition, where parts of the cost of sales are not denominated in the same currency of such sales, translation
risks arise. If the euro gains in strength, the value of our foreign sales will fall, and if the euro weakens, our costs
for foreign imports will rise.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

We carry insurance of various types, including general business interruption and third-party liability, property
damage, electronic damage, transportation damage and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. Furthermore,
we carry insurance covering cyber risks. Cyber risks are insured up to €10 million. We are also exposed to risks
related to the health and safety of our employees and contractors as well as other workplace safety risks. As our
uniform health and safety standards are mainly issued to our German facilities, each region is working under
different standards and are at varying stages of maturity and there exists only limited control in this space.
Additionally, documentation and record keeping of safety records may prove insufficient to substantiate to
regulators that our health and safety systems are operating effectively. If staff and contractors get injured during

48


-----

the course of their duties we may, among other things, face fines and penalties from regulators as well as damage
to our reputation.

We are furthermore exposed to risks due to external factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to,
accidents, vandalism, natural hazards, acts of terrorism, damage and loss caused by fire, power failures or other
events, that could potentially lead to personal injuries, damage to third-party property or the environment or the
interruption of our business operations. Accidents or other incidents that occur at our offices and workshops or
involve our personnel or operations could result in claims for damages against us and could damage our reputation.
We may not always be able to accurately foresee all situations that should otherwise be covered by the terms of
our insurance policies and, as a result, we may not be covered by insurance in specific instances. While we believe
we maintain appropriate levels of insurance consistent with industry practice, we may experience incidents of a
nature that are not covered by insurance. As a result, the amount of any costs, including fines or damages that we
might incur in such circumstances, could substantially exceed any insurance we have to cover such losses.
Furthermore, the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages within a given year may
have an adverse effect on our insurance premiums. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in
response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance
market in general. We may not be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.
The occurrence of any of these events, alone or in combination, may have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Many of our suppliers rely on credit insurance to protect their receivables, and any changes to, or slow_**
**_adjustments or withdrawals of, such credit insurance might cause suppliers to seek to reduce their credit_**
**_exposure to us._**

We believe that many of our suppliers have traditionally taken out credit insurance to protect their receivables
against the risk of bad debt, insolvency or protracted default of their buyers, including us. Credit levels available
to us from our suppliers remain dependent on the general economic environment and our financial position. If
there is a significant decrease in the availability of credit insurance to our suppliers, or if an increase in credit
levels is administered too slowly or such insurance is withdrawn in its entirety, and if such suppliers are unwilling
or unable to take credit risk themselves or find alternative credit sources, they may choose to reduce their credit
exposure to us, for example by seeking to change their credit terms vis-à-vis our Group. Any such actions could
have a material adverse effect on our cash position, lead to an increase in our indebtedness or have a negative
impact on our product offerings and, thus, on our sales. This could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

**_We might be exposed to tax risks or tax liabilities resulting from adverse amendments to current legislation,_**
**_including developments in the tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce in the jurisdictions in which_**
**_we operate, that could adversely affect the commercial use of our sites and our financial results._**

Our business is subject to the general tax environment in the countries in which we operate, such as Germany,
Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Changes in tax legislation,
administrative practice or case law or treatments of tax facts by the relevant tax authorities which deviate from
our assessments — and might be applied retroactively — could result in a higher tax burden. The realization of
any of these risks, alone or in combination, may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In particular, developments in tax law, regulation, or case law, with regards to transnational e-commerce activities
could affect our tax burden. Since 2017, the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework has been working on addressing
the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy and agreed on a two-pillar tax approach with
pillar one referring to the re-allocation of taxing rights, addressing issues such as where tax should be paid and on
what basis (i.e., where sustained and significant business is conducted, regardless of a physical presence), and
pillar two ensuring a minimum tax to be paid by multinational enterprises. In Germany, Pillar Two has been
implemented by the Minimum Taxation Act (Gesetz zur Gewährleistung einer globalen Mindestbesteuerung für
_Unternehmensgruppen (Mindeststeuergesetz – MinStG)). The new law came into force on December 28, 2023_
and implements Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 (“Pillar Two Directive”). The new law will generally apply
to fiscal years beginning after December 30, 2023. Therefore, although we currently do not expect any impact to
our tax obligations derived from Pillar One and Pillar Two (including the Minimum Taxation Act), the
implementation of Pillar One and Pillar Two (including the Minimum Taxation Act) could have adverse effects
for us in the future as we are a digital and multinational enterprise.

49


-----

Changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce in the jurisdictions in which we operate could
adversely affect the commercial use of our sites and our financial results. For example, some jurisdictions in which
we operate our business (e.g., Italy) have introduced new local taxes on transnational e-commerce activities
(“digital services taxes” or “DST”). These DST generally aim at securing taxation rights of the jurisdiction for
the revenue / profit generated by the transnational e-commerce activities with customers who are resident in this
specific jurisdiction. We have established a process to assess on a regular (i.e., quarterly) basis whether our
revenue / profit is subject to these DST. In the context of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework, certain states
generally agreed upon mitigating their existing DST and abstaining from introducing new DST before the earlier
of December 31, 2023, or the date Pillar One rules become effective, but there remains a general risk that new
local DST will be introduced or that the existing DST will be applied differently with the result that this could
adversely affect our tax liability. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other
taxes on e-commerce. New or revised taxes – e.g., sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes – could increase the cost of
doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling products over the internet. New
taxes could also lead to increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes to the
relevant tax authorities which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.

Moreover, legislators and tax authorities may change territoriality rules or their interpretation for the application
of VAT on cross-border services, which may lead to additional payments for past and future periods. In addition,
court decisions are sometimes ignored by competent tax authorities or overruled by higher courts, which could
lead to higher legal and tax advisory costs and create uncertainty. New taxes could also result in additional costs
necessary to collect the data required to assess these taxes and to remit them to the relevant tax authorities which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.

**_Our intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, are subject to the risk of impairment._**

Our intangible assets, primarily consisting of goodwill, customer relationships, trademarks, licenses and software,
are regularly reviewed on the basis of certain assumptions, including cash-flow and growth rate estimates. For
example, the permanent closure of our stationary store in Frankfurt in July 2021 led to a full impairment of the
respective customer base in the amount of €5.0 million. As of March 31, 2024, our goodwill amounted to
€203.5 million and our other intangible assets amounted to €230.4 million. Any changes to the assumptions, in
particular negative revenue trends, underlying the valuation of our intangible assets could increase the risk of
impairment.

**_We might be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, including local trademarks and_**
**_domain names for our sites._**

We may be unable to protect our trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights and may infringe
the intellectual property rights of third parties. We own a number of intellectual property rights, including
trademarks and trade names, which, along with related internet domain names, are important to our business.
Certain of these intellectual property rights have in the past been, and in the future may be, infringed by third
parties. We regularly register our trademarks and trade names in Europe and other markets. We are the registrant
of the BestSecret trademark in numerous jurisdictions and have also registered various internet domain names
containing _e.g., our brand names for our websites combined with the relevant top-level domain in those_
jurisdictions in which we are active, _e.g., www.bestsecret.com, or event names for events we are carrying out_
under our brand. Additionally, we have registered many trademarks of our private labels in numerous jurisdictions.
We have also registered selected internet domain names for some of our proprietary brands and labels. Domain
names are generally regulated by internet regulatory bodies and are also subject to the trademark laws and other
related laws of each country in which we currently operate.

As we seek to register our trademarks in new jurisdictions, we may encounter opposition which may hinder our
ability to continue to register our trademarks as desired, and, furthermore, registration can be a lengthy process.
Registration of intellectual property rights, especially trademarks, which we have applied for or intend to apply
for in the future may be denied in countries where we consider registration necessary or desirable. As a result, we
may be unable to prevent third parties from using the same or similar intellectual property rights. Same or similar
third-party trademarks and internet domain names may already exist in jurisdictions where we operate or intend
to operate, and we may be restricted from using the relevant trademark or internet domain name in the respective
jurisdiction. Our registered intellectual property rights, especially trademarks, may be subject to cancellation and
as a result third parties would be free to use such intellectual property rights. For any particular country, if we do
not have, or cannot obtain or maintain on reasonable terms, the ability to use our trademarks or a major proprietary
brand, or to use or register our domain name, we could be forced either to incur significant additional expenses to

50


-----

market our products within that country—including the development of a new brand and the creation of new
promotional materials and packaging—or elect not to sell products in that country.

We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights,
including our domain names. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights, domain names and other proprietary rights.
We may initiate claims or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our
intellectual property rights, domain names or proprietary rights or to establish the validity of such rights. Despite
our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise
violating our intellectual property rights, domain names and other proprietary rights, leading to a decrease in the
value of such rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expenses
for us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and financial condition. This may also lead to a weakening of the goodwill that is associated
with our brands and may undermine our reputation.

Furthermore, the regulations governing domain names and laws protecting marks and similar proprietary rights
could change in ways that block or interfere with our ability to use relevant domains or our current brands.
Regulatory bodies may establish additional generic or country-code top-level domains or may allow modifications
of the requirements for registering, holding, or using domain names. As a result, we might not be able to register,
use or maintain the domain names that utilize our brand names in all of the countries in which we currently conduct
business or intend to conduct business in the future.

If we are unable to obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property and defend it against third parties, we
may not be able to advance our business. This could affect our competitive position and any resulting decrease in
revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be subject to claims based on unfair commercial practices which could have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Marketing activities are significant for the success of our business and our expansion. We use e-mail newsletters,
app push notifications and other messaging services in order to promote our platform, inform customers of our
product offerings and the status of their transactions. We cannot exclude that such marketing activities due to a
mistake by one of our employees may breach laws governing marketing conduct, in particular the UWG. Any
perceived or actual breach of such laws could subject us to litigation and may prevent us from certain marketing
conduct or may require us to change existing advertising campaigns, for example with respect to e-mail advertising
or the use of certain advertising claims. We may have to expend significant financial and human resources to
defend such claims and adjust our internal processes. Restrictions on our current or planned marketing activities
could affect our competitive position and any resulting decrease in revenue could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our pricing or prices on individual items, in particular with respect to references that we may make to comparative
prices or original prices, could be incorrect, which could lead to notices, warnings by competitors or other market
participants. As a consequence, we have in the past been, and could in the future be, required to adjust the
presentation of our price comparisons.

Our competitors may use certain marketing activities to attract customers in a manner that breaches laws
governing marketing conduct. We may, for factual or legal reasons, not be able to prevent such breaches which
may lead to a loss of customers and a decrease in revenue. This could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Conducting business in multiple countries requires us to comply with numerous, complex, and sometimes_**
**_conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, which makes compliance more costly and challenging._**

We currently operate in 27 European countries and are subject to various laws and regulations of these countries.
Many of these laws and regulations are complex and difficult to interpret. Moreover, as we expand our
international operations to target customers in additional countries, we will be subjected to additional laws and
regulatory regimes. The legal and regulatory frameworks governing our business and operations may become
increasingly uncertain due to quickly changing laws, contradictory interpretation of laws and regulations,
administrative bypassing of legal frameworks or a lack of market precedents upon which we can rely.

Our international business is subject to laws and regulations in many areas, including those governing product
safety, local employment, privacy, data security, telecommunications, online content, intellectual property

51


-----

protection, corporate governance, foreign ownership and foreign investment, tax, finance, money laundering,
online payment, anti-corruption and antitrust. These various laws and regulations often evolve and sometimes
conflict with each other. Furthermore, operating in foreign jurisdictions entails an inherent risk of misinterpreting
and wrongly implementing foreign laws and regulations. While we are not aware of any material breach by us of
any applicable laws and regulations, we cannot rule out that we have not been in full compliance with these laws
and regulations in the past.

International sanctions may negatively affect our operations. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late
February 2022 has and will potentially continue to have a wide range of supply chain implications, including
increases in costs to source materials and disruption in freight transport. Additionally, some of the tax systems in
our countries of operations are very complex and there is no guarantee that the relevant tax authorities agree with
the positions we have taken or the tax optimization structures and measures we have used to minimize legal risks,
administrative burdens and tax rates. The application of foreign direct investment laws and regulations, license
rules and similar rules and regulations is also often unclear. These laws and regulations are subject to multiple
interpretations, e.g., by different courts, regulators, and other players in the legal community, which may differ
from the interpretations to which we have adhered. In other countries, changes in the political or legal climate
may impact our use of local currency and local banking. Similarly, we are bound by extended waiting periods and
complex and costly administrative approval processes and registration.

As these laws continue to evolve and as we expand into new jurisdictions, our compliance efforts will become
more complex and expensive, and the risk of non-compliance will increase. Violations of applicable laws and
regulations may harm our reputation and result in legal action, criminal and civil sanctions, or administrative fines
and penalties against us or members of our governing bodies and our employees. Such violations may also result
in damage claims by third parties or other adverse legal consequences, including class action lawsuits and
enforcement actions by national and international regulators resulting in the limitation or prohibition of business
operations. There is no guarantee that we can successfully manage or avoid any of the legal risks to which we are
exposed, and non-compliance with the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern our operations, whether
intentional or not, may have material adverse effects on our businesses, including causing us to cease our
operations entirely.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in several different countries._**

We are an international business and have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in
developing operations in the markets in which we operate. We face a variety of risks generally associated with
doing business in multiple markets. Such risks relate to the following matters, among others:

  - challenges caused by distance, linguistic and cultural differences;

  - the need to adapt our websites and the merchandise we sell to local tastes;

  - difficulties enforcing our existing intellectual property rights and obtaining necessary third-party
intellectual property rights;

  - difficulties in maintaining a system of effective internal controls and managing the accounting and tax
complexities of an international business;

  - foreign exchange issues that may make repatriating income costly or impossible;

  - fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

  - economic, legal and political instability;

  - increased transportation and shipping costs;

  - staffing difficulties, regional or national labor strikes or other labor disputes;

  - tariffs, quotas, taxes, price controls and other market barriers; and

  - longer payment cycles in some markets.

Our failure to successfully manage any of such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to consumer protection laws and other regulatory requirements which may change, resulting_**
**_in additional costs._**

We are subject to different time, manner, place and content restrictions in the various regulatory environments in
which we operate, compliance with which can be difficult and costly. Even within a single jurisdiction, we are
often subject to various laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, data protection, unsolicited
commercial communications, general terms and conditions of contract, tax, child protection and
telecommunications, as well as other restrictions on the transmission of certain content, which may impede our
efforts to improve, license or distribute our products. Because we operate in different countries, we could face
difficulties and increased costs relating to compliance with numerous different regulatory regimes and monitoring
ongoing regulatory action.

Regulatory changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage, causing us to lose customers and income. Our
failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines and exposure to potential liability claims from
customers or third parties. Additionally, the global nature of the internet and telecommunications technology can
make it difficult to ensure that our websites, advertisements and content remain within the scope of their intended
audience. Moreover, despite our efforts to comply with local regulatory requirements, our websites and
advertisements could be made available by third parties in areas where their dissemination violates local
requirements, and we could face penalties and damage to our reputation. Finally, certain jurisdictions may attempt
to levy novel sales, income or other taxes on our internet-based activities. New taxes could increase our cost of
doing business and expose us to penalties. Any such increased costs, penalties, reputational damage or increased
costs associated with maintaining compliance in different regulatory environments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, which may adversely affect our financial results_**
**_and position._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we may, from time to time, become involved in various claims, lawsuits,
investigations, arbitration and administrative proceedings, such as, for instance, labor, intellectual property or tax
proceedings, which may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments. Adverse judgments or
determinations in one or more of these proceedings may require us to change the way we do business or use
substantial resources in adhering to settlements or pay fines or other penalties. The costs related to such
proceedings may be significant, and, even if there is a positive outcome, we may still have to bear part or all of
our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants, insurance or otherwise. This
may undermine our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects. See “Our Business—Litigation.”

Any such proceedings, even if we are successful, could divert management resources, incur certain expenses and
cause damage to our reputation. The involvement in any such litigation, administrative and arbitration proceedings
as well as the outcome of such litigation and proceedings, which cannot be predicted and may not be in accordance
with our assessments, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

We are currently not subject to any pending material litigation proceedings.

**_Product recalls, product liability claims, and breaches of corporate social responsibility could harm our_**
**_reputation and business._**

There is a risk that the goods we sell may cause property damage or injury to our customers. While we believe
that our operations comply in all material respects with all applicable product safety and consumer protection laws
and regulations, the sale of defective products might result in product recalls, product liability claims and/or
administrative fines or criminal charges against us or our management. As we are the “responsible person” for
private label and third-party merchandise that we offer, within the context of the applicable regulations on product
safety applicable to our merchandise, any quality defect could lead (based on EU law or similar applicable national
laws) to customer claims, administrative or criminal proceedings and penalties. Our third-party suppliers as well
as our own private label brands’ reputation could be damaged by any such claims, proceedings and penalties.
Even if an event causing a product recall proves to be unfounded or if a product liability claim against us is
unsuccessful, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that products sold by us caused injury or damage,
or any allegation that the goods sold by us were defective, could adversely affect our reputation with both existing
and potential customers as well as our corporate and brand image. We also face risks associated with
environmental, animal-rights and sustainability concerns. For example, any negative publicity campaigns

53


-----

concerning low-priced, short-lived fashion items may negatively affect our reputation or our sales. Similarly,
negative publicity associated with the sale of fashion items manufactured using fur or other animal-sourced
products may negatively affect our reputation or our sales. We are further exposed to risks in relation to possible
breaches of corporate social responsibility, including ethical sourcing, working conditions, child labor and
responsible recruitment, which may harm our reputation and prospects. For example, if improper working
conditions are found or alleged to exist at one or more of the factories in which the fashion and lifestyle products
we sell are manufactured, or if there is a major injury or loss-of-life incident in such factories, we could face
negative publicity that could damage our reputation and the perception of our own labels, and we may be required
to pay fines, face enhanced scrutiny by regulators or be subjected to other adverse legal consequences.

We also work with employment agencies that provide us with workers to fill open positions. We face the risk that
these agencies may provide workers who do not have the necessary legal documentation. It is also possible that
these agencies or other service providers may use illicit means to obtain such documentation, which increases
underlying risks as human trafficking, modern slavery and forced labor. In cases where we become aware of
material violations, we ask our business partners to remedy the situation. If they fail to do so, we terminate our
cooperation with the relevant partner and do not employ the suggested workers. Yet, any such termination may
affect our operations and reputation. It can also result in legal liability (including criminal liability) for
non-compliance with human rights, international labor standards and specific criminal provisions, such as forced
labor. Additionally, deficiencies in the area of corporate social responsibility may also negatively affect our
recruiting efforts or disrupt our business if a large number of workers were disqualified from employment due to
a lack of proper legal documentation as well as if our business partners terminate relationships with us due to
reputational implications. There is a rise of strategic litigation focusing on forced labor allegations in the garment
industry, which could negatively affect our reputation and business should we become targets of such litigation.

The materialization of any of the foregoing risks, alone or in combination, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The use of open-source software could increase our risk that hackers could gain unauthorized access to our_**
**_systems, and we could be subject to litigation if third parties challenge our rights to use such software on an_**
**_exclusive basis._**

Some of our software and systems contain open-source software, which may pose certain risks. The licenses
applicable to open-source software typically require that the source code subject to the license be made available
to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open-source software continue to be licensed under
open-source licenses. Although we do not intend to use or modify open-source software without holding the
necessary licenses, we could, however, face claims from third parties alleging the infringement of their intellectual
property rights or demanding the release or license of the open-source software or derivative works developed by
us using such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the
terms of the applicable open-source license. These claims could result in litigation, require us to purchase a license,
publicly release the affected portions of our source code, and limit the licensing of our technologies or cease
offering the implicated solutions.

In addition, use of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial
software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide contractual protections with respect to the software.
Also, the licensors are not obliged to maintain their software or provide any support. There is a certain risk that
the authors of the open-source software cease updating and attending to the software. Engineering the software
updates by ourselves could be expensive and time-consuming. The use of open-source software can also present
additional security risks because the source code for open-source software is publicly available, which could make
it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our sites and systems that rely on
open-source software.

Any unauthorized access to our systems as well as third-party challenges to our user rights and claims regarding
the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could divert our management’s attention from
day-to-day tasks, incur significant legal costs and thus have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business
and financial condition.

**_We are subject to customs and international trade laws that could require us to modify our current business_**
**_practices and incur increased costs or could result in a delay in getting products through customs and port_**
**_operations, which may limit our growth and cause us to suffer reputational damage._**

Our business is conducted globally, with goods imported from and exported to a substantial number of countries.
The vast majority of products sold through our apps and websites are sourced internationally. We are subject to
numerous regulations, including customs and international trade laws, that govern the importation and sale of
fashion and lifestyle products. In addition, we face risks associated with trade protection laws, policies and
measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of
exemptions from taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing
requirements in the countries in which we operate. Our failure to comply with import or export rules and
restrictions or to properly classify items under tariff regulations and pay the appropriate duties could expose us to
fines and penalties.

Legal requirements are frequently changing and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate
cost of compliance with these requirements or their effects on our operations. We may be required to make
significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations,
which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

If customs and international trade laws were to change, or if our management, employees, retailers, or suppliers
were to violate any of these laws, we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or
penalties, or suffer reputational harm, any of which could reduce demand for our services and negatively impact
our results of operations. In addition, our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a
timely manner. As a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports. Labor disputes
or other disruptions at ports create significant risks for our business, e.g., if work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes, or
other disruptions occur. Any of these factors could result in reduced sales or canceled orders, which may limit our
growth and damage our reputation.

**_We use standardized sales agreements, as well as standardized terms and conditions, which increase the_**
**_potential that all contract terms used therein may be invalid or unenforceable if any clause is held to be void._**

We entertain legal relationships with a large number of persons, including our customers, manufacturers of our
private label merchandise and our employees. In this context we use standardized documents, standard form
contracts and standardized terms and conditions. We have introduced general terms and conditions, terms of
delivery and chemical restrictions in the context of our relationship with certain brands following a brand
clustering approach. If such documents, contracts or terms and conditions are interpreted in a way that is
disadvantageous to us, or if clauses in such documents or contracts are declared invalid and thus displaced by
statutory provisions which are unfavorable to us, a large number of standardized documents, contracts or terms
and conditions could be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position
and results of operations.

Additionally, standardized contractual terms have to comply with the statutory law on general terms and
conditions. For example, under German law standardized contractual terms (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen)
are subject to rigid fairness controls by the courts regarding their content and the way they, or legal concepts
described therein, are presented to the other contractual party by the person using them. This applies, in particular,
when they are used vis-à-vis consumers. Generally, standardized terms are invalid if they are not transparent,
clearly worded, or if they are unbalanced or discriminate against the other party inappropriately. Due to the
frequent changes to the legal framework, particularly with regard to court decisions relating to general terms and
conditions, we cannot fully protect ourselves against risks arising from the use of such standardized contractual
terms. Even if documents, contracts and terms and conditions are prepared with legal advice, it is not impossible
to avoid all potential risks from the outset or in the future, as the changes may continue to occur in the legal
framework, particularly through case law. A change in the legal framework could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

Following the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2024, on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to the Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had total financial
indebtedness of €727.2 million including indebtedness under the Notes. See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences
to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

  - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

  - making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

  - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund
new debt portfolio purchases, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or other
general corporate purposes;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not
as highly leveraged; and

  - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us_**
**_to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

The terms of the Indenture will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness,
including in respect of committed borrowings of up to €110.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and additional Notes by the Issuer. The new debt that we incur in the future, including, for example,
in connection with acquisitions, may rank pari passu with, be structurally senior to, or be secured by assets that
do not form part of the Collateral for, the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Any such additional indebtedness could
mature prior to the Notes. We may also enter into qualified receivables financing programs, pursuant to which we
would pledge receivables that either do not form part of the Collateral or would be released from the Collateral in
connection with any such program. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under
certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will not prevent us
from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Furthermore, if we are able
to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries under the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted
subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other
activities in which Restricted Subsidiaries may not engage. See “Description of the Notes,” “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” If new debt is added to our and our_
subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital_**
**_needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

  - create or incur certain liens;

56


-----

  - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of such
entity;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

  - make certain investments;

  - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances
to, and on the transfer of, assets to such entity;

  - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

  - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we are subject could_
limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities
and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
which negative covenants are substantially similar to the covenants that will be included in the Indenture.

A breach of any of those covenants or the occurrence of certain specified events will, subject to applicable cure
periods and other limitations, result in an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon
the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Majority Lenders
(being, subject to certain limitations, lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement whose commitments
thereunder aggregate more than 66⅔% of the total commitments thereunder) could, while such event of default
remains unremedied or unwaived, cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all
amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately
due and payable. In addition, a default or event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could
lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, accelerate the payment of amounts owing to them under such other debt instruments,
we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments
to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors
could proceed against any security interests granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other_**
**_actions to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

We have, and after the issuance of the Notes, we will continue to have significant debt service obligations. Our
ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations,
will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to
general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.”

Our Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes will mature in 2029. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements”_ and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility and of the obligations under the Notes and any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient
cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity
needs, or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be
required to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain
such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business obligations, activities
or capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial,
or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot

57


-----

guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms,
if at all, or that those actions would secure sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our indebtedness.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such
time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the international
credit and capital markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and
may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the
Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.
In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness.

In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and
other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the Indenture and the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and the use of proceeds from any such disposal.
We may not be able to carry out certain disposals or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the
proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet
any of our debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit
us to meet our debt service obligations.

**_Our ability to maintain current levels of working capital may be adversely affected if we are unable to utilize_**
**_supply chain financing (“SCF”) programs to extend our payment terms for certain suppliers._**

To improve working capital efficiency, we utilize SCF programs that allow us to extend our payments terms up
to 90 days by using a payment service provider while our suppliers are paid within the agreed payment terms. To
the extent that these various SCF programs were terminated, our financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity
could be adversely affected by higher working capital levels due to lower levels of cash. If working capital is
negatively impacted by the termination of these programs, and we are unable to secure alternative financing
sources on similar commercial terms, we may have to make increased use of our cash reserves or incur into
borrowing under more onerous terms, which may have a significant effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies_**
**_within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could negatively impact our business or_**
**_our ability to refinance our liabilities._**

Economic and political events in recent years affecting European economies have raised a number of questions
regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union. Credit risk in these countries and in
other Eurozone countries could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the
overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and
political circumstances in individual euro member states. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and
more recently in Ukraine and other world events could adversely affect the economies of the European Union
(which continues to be the primary region in which we generate our revenue) and those of other countries. Future
developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of
measures by the European Commission and EU member states to address debt burdens of certain countries in
Europe, the overall stability of the Eurozone, the influx of refugees in certain European countries and the rise of
populism in Europe.

The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the
euro as a currency, or the reintroduction of an individual currency in Germany, could have major negative effects
on our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely affect the economy in Germany,
where we provide products and services to our customers. In particular, the departure of Germany from the euro
would increase our exposure to changes in currency rates. In addition, the departure of Germany from the
Eurozone may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate control laws. Any of these developments could
affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. The potentially severe impact of these events on Europe and the global
financial system could also have a negative impact on the value and marketability of the Notes. Should the euro
dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations and for
parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro, such as supply contracts, would be determined
by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related

58


-----

issues, could adversely affect our trading environment and the value of the Notes, and could have adverse
consequences for us with respect to our outstanding euro-denominated debt obligations, which could adversely
affect our financial condition.

Furthermore, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains and the Indenture will contain covenants
restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile—We are
_subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and_
_to pursue business opportunities and activities.” Certain such covenants impose limitations based on euro amounts_
(e.g., the amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were to
significantly decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by these covenants would become tighter, further
restricting our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business.

**_Drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to
EURIBOR (in respect of loans denominated in euro), SONIA (in respect of loans denominated in sterling) or
SARON (in respect of loans denominated in Swiss francs), as adjusted periodically, plus any applicable spread.
These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. While we may enter into certain hedging arrangements
with respect to our interest obligations, hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a
significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent that interest rates or
any drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our
cash flow.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Offering and Our Capital Structure**

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed disposals._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral
securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, under the terms of the
Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be
secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the
secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group (as
defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) for the purpose of
enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description
_of the Notes—Security.”_

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable,
against, and the liens over any other assets of, such entities and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Notes
and Note Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement,” “Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees—Note Guarantees Release” and “Description of_
_the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The ability of holders of the Notes to recover under the Collateral may be limited._**

The Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we
cannot assure the holders of the Notes that there will be a market for the Collateral or that, if such market does
exist, there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation. The shares of the Issuer and its Guarantors may also
have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in relation to the Issuer or
any of its Guarantors because all of the obligations of such Issuer or Guarantor (subject to the release mechanism
in the Intercreditor Agreement) must be satisfied prior to distribution to such entity’s equity holders. As a result,
the holders of the Notes may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement of the pledges of the
shares in the Issuer or the Guarantors. In addition, the value of this Collateral may fluctuate over time.

Furthermore, each security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by
applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. See “Risks Related to
_Our Structure and the Financing—Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations_

59


-----

_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability.”_

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this Offering
Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, cash
management obligations (including our supply chain financing) and certain hedging obligations, if any. The
Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking _pari passu with the Notes (including non-priority hedging_
arrangements) to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights
of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in obligations secured on a
_pari passu basis with the Notes, or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes._

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend
upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of
the economies in which our operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral
should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a
market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our
liquidation. In addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity may be of no value if the applicable entity
is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, certain of our contracts include a change of
control clause, which may be triggered by the enforcement of Collateral and may limit the value of the Collateral.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the
Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property
subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and
the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that
Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would
have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) the
Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the
intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of
the Collateral.

**_Certain of the security interests granted in favor of the holders of the Notes will not rank pari passu with the_**
**_security interests granted in favor of lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and holders of the_**
**_Notes are relying on the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve a first-priority lien in respect of the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes._**

We will enter into new Security Documents over the Collateral to secure the indebtedness represented by the
Notes. Under German law, certain security interests (such as pledges over shares or bank accounts) granted under
those new Security Documents will, because they are granted at a later point of time, rank behind the security
interests securing the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. However, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes will be, contractually, but not _in rem, treated and deemed to be secured by the relevant_
Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Therefore, the first-priority right
in the relevant Collateral granted in favor of the holders of the Notes will depend on the enforceability of the
Intercreditor Agreement. If the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were found to be invalid
or held to be unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the holders of the
Notes would not benefit from such first-priority treatment and the security interests granted in favor of the holders
of the Notes would rank behind, and be subordinated to, any prior-ranking security interests.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of_**
**_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the_**
**_granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the_**
**_laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees may create hardening periods for
such security interests in certain jurisdictions. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The granting of shared security_
interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such
hardening periods, in particular as the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of

60


-----

the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness, the transfer
of Collateral within the Group and the implementation of certain corporate reorganizations. The applicable
hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been
granted or perfected.

In each case, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the hardening period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.
See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.” The same rights will apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection_
with the accession of any other subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over
their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of noteholders. Please see “Description of the Notes—
_Security.”_

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Note Guarantees_**
**_and the Collateral securing the Notes and Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent_**
**_or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees
may be released automatically. See “Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees—Releases” and
“Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral
comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, then claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released or transferred.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.” Your ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such_
circumstances.

Additionally, even though the holders of the Notes will share in the Collateral securing the Notes with the creditors
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, under certain circumstances, the creditors under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control enforcement actions with respect
to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not the holders of the Notes agree with those actions. See
“—Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed disposals”
and “Description of the Notes—Security—Enforcement of Security Interests.”

Furthermore, the Note Guarantees and security interests will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal as
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes.”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that
have the benefit of first-priority security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether
on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability
of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can
be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements,
statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests granted in favor of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in collateral in certain jurisdictions. For example, under
German law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain
specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security
interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot
assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure
on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets,
and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation of the
business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.

61


-----

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local_**
**_law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted
only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only
the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will
not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets but require
a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws
of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as
registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including, among others,
Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and
enforceability of such security interests, the applicable Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation
(the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well
as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain
jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests
which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as
novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount
and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge
the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the
Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested
in the courts of these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or
validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel
debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value
or even loss of the Collateral or Note Guarantees.

Finally, the provision of Note Guarantees and execution of the Collateral will be subject to certain agreed security
principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or security providers of the obligation to provide guarantees and/or
grant security interests in assets otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could have a material
adverse impact on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes.

**_The Notes will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing_**
**_cash flows._**

The Notes and any amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will, and future indebtedness that we may
incur could, bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR or other benchmarks, plus a
spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses
associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability
to make payments on the Notes.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates,
there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging
itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate
any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

62


-----

**_EURIBOR or other benchmarks may be discontinued or change in the future._**

Various interest rate benchmarks (including historic EURIBOR) have been the subject of recent national and
international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU
Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented.

EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical
benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms
and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently
than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants
to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be
predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures
or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation
thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to
make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service
debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of their successors or other
benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have
not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may
be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such
obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of
offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates
information at the relevant time). In addition, the development of future alternatives to EURIBOR may result in
the Notes performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR had
not developed.

The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the
Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate successor rate, which
means that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments,
that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the
_Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and_
the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may
trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer
in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes.

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement
of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at
the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of
EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such
consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If
EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be
determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the Notes
or the Note Guarantees under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless
so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable laws. No sale, assignment,
participation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require the Issuer
or any of its officers or directors to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the U.S. Investment
Company Act or any other similar legislation or regulatory action. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have not
agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and do not have any intention to
do so.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in exchange
for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will

63


-----

not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depository (or its nominee) for Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch, as Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing
the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes,
you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations as a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters
or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the applicable definitive
registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

  - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar
to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the
market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market
for Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible
that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on
you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no
assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may
not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot
assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the Notes.

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the_**
**_Notes and Note Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments in its subsidiaries, its rights under certain shareholder loans and other intercompany receivables (if
any). As a result, the Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of
dividends, interest payments on intercompany loans, payments under profit and loss pooling agreements between
the Issuer and the relevant members of the Group or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations,
including its obligations under the Notes. The obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and

64


-----

will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior and senior subordinated indebtedness of
the Issuer, including obligations under, or guarantees of obligations under, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Notes.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flow
of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of
the Issuer, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or
advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and
the Note Guarantees. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will
generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to it. Under German law, all dividends may
only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, in principle, interim dividend distributions
are not allowed under German law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no
obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

Additionally, various agreements governing our debt may restrict, and in some cases, may actually prevent the
ability of the subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Such restrictions include those created by the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and “—Intercreditor Agreement.” Applicable tax laws may_
also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our
subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such
payments.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even
though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted
to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group
in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_The Notes and each of the Note Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and_**
**_preference shares (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will be Guarantors of the Notes. The Indenture does not limit the transfer of assets to,
or the making of investments in, any of our restricted subsidiaries, including our restricted subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes.

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference
shareholders (if any) of such subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such
subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their
claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent
entity. As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including
trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer or Guarantor.

As payments on the Notes are only required to be made by the Issuer and the Guarantors, no payments are required
to be made from assets of subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes unless those assets are transferred by
dividend or otherwise to the Issuer or one of the Guarantors.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with the interests of the holders of Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholders may, in certain circumstances, conflict with your interests as a holder
of Notes. Permira Funds and its affiliates control the Issuer. As a result, Permira Funds have, and will continue to
have, the power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as
well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations. Our
principal shareholders may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other
transactions that, in its judgment, will enhance its equity investments, although such transactions might involve
risks to you as a holder of Notes. For example, our principal shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional
indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or pay dividends, in each case so long as the Indenture so permit. The
incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets
could reduce our ability to generate sales, each of which could adversely affect you as a holder of Notes. In

65


-----

addition, our principal shareholders may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours or do
business with us.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, only through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the
security. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims
of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these
security interests. Absent perfection, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty
enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties, including a
trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany.”_

**_Each Note Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_**
**_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Note Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In
addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the relevant
Security Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope
to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest and the Indenture will provide
that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor,
without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee/security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under German
or other applicable law or without resulting in a breach of any applicable law, and enforcement of each Note
Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses
include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws,
guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, in case of bankruptcy
of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a court could
declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act
performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Note Guarantees or the security
interests granted under the Security Documents, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”) and, if payment had already_
been made under a Note Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the
recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court
found, inter alia, that:

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

  - the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions,
even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Note Guarantee or security interest;

  - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant
Note Guarantee/security interests and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of
the relevant Note Guarantee/security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because
of the relevant Note Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would
incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or

  - the relevant Note Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security
provider.

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or
custodian (Sachwalter) may challenge (anfechten) transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) or acts (Rechtshandlungen) that
are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable avoidance periods.

In addition, in Germany, there are significant restrictions on subsidiary guarantees and the granting of security
interests for shareholder liabilities to the extent the proceeds under such liabilities are not on-lent by the
shareholder to such subsidiary guarantors or such guarantees and security interests do otherwise benefit from
exemptions from German capital maintenance rules, such exemptions being recognized for obligations rendered
within a domination or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs-oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) or if
a valuable claim for compensation or repayment exists (Bestehen eines vollwertigen Gegenleistungs-oder
_Rückgewähranspruches)._

Furthermore, the payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to
satisfy the obligations under the Note Guarantees and Security Documents. There can be no assurances that we
will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Note Guarantees and
Security Documents, whether or not we pay dividends. In addition, the payment under the Note Guarantees and
the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate
formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and
board resolutions. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral is governed by the laws of Germany and any jurisdiction applicable to any future Collateral. In the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions.
The rights under the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, and it may be difficult
to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover,
such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial
uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various laws in multiple
jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the
ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. A summary
description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany is set out in “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Collateral and Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The insolvency laws of Germany and other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy_**
**_laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of
Germany. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Germany or
another relevant jurisdiction. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with,
each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental
and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these
laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply,
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Note Guarantees in those jurisdictions
or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,” with respect to the jurisdictions_
mentioned above.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “Change of Control Triggering Event,” the Issuer would be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If such a change
of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that
we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that
the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our
other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may
result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the Revolving Credit

-----

Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under
such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its
subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control
may be limited by our then existing financial resources (see “—The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon
_cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes”). If an event constituting a Change of Control_
Triggering Event occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes under the terms of structurally senior indebtedness, we may seek the consent of the lenders
under such indebtedness to the change of control offer with respect to the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent is not obtained and such refinancing is not successful,
the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require thirdparty financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we
would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute
a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_In certain circumstances, a Change of Control Offer will not be required to be made._**

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power
or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.
Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain
provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization,
restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that
might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will not be deemed to be a change of control
if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body
of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and
whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to
a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the values of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return
on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which
the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other
than U.S. dollars by U.S. holders (as defined under “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”) may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if_
any. See “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and each of the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside of the United States,
and our business is conducted entirely outside of the United States. The directors, managers and/or executive
officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are all non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their
assets are located outside of the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of
certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their
directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments
obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the

68


-----

Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.
The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Germany. There is, therefore,
doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such
jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that
a court in Germany would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action
brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. See “Service of Process and
_Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other
factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be
given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered
or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Following an IPO, there may be a change in obligor of the Notes which may be a taxable event for income tax_**
**_purposes._**

Upon certain circumstances, the issuer of the Notes may be modified in connection with an IPO as described in
“—Description of the Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown” and “—Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—Provisions Following an IPO.” Depending on the facts and_
circumstances at the time of such event, such modification may change the obligor of the Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes thereby resulting in a deemed exchange of the outstanding Notes, which may be a taxable
event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—
_Modification of the Notes following an IPO.” The same may apply in other jurisdictions._

partner and customer relationships, a tech-focused mindset, and its inherent contribution to more sustainability in
the fashion industry. We have a strong track record of profitable growth over many years. For the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated revenue of €942.9
million, €1,051.0 million, €1,226.0 million and €1,290.6 million, respectively, an Adjusted EBITDA Before Run
Rate Cost Synergies of €138.7 million, €132.5 million, €165.8 million and €183.0 million, respectively, and an
Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin of 14.7%, 12.6%, 13.5% and 14.2%, respectively.
Our revenue and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA grew from €1,077.8 million and €143.6 million, respectively, in
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 to €1,290.6 million and €200.9 million in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024, representing increases over 20% and 40%, respectively, over the same period. Our online revenue
accounted for 93.0%, 91.2%, 91.9% and 92.1% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022
and 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively (with a CAGR of 13.3% from the year ended
December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2023). While 59.0% of our revenue for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2024 (€762.0 million) was generated in Germany, our international business outside of Germany
continues to gain importance relative to our Germany business and experienced strong revenue growth from
€384.3 million (35.7% of revenue) in the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 to €528.5 million (41% of revenue)
in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, and from €267.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€489.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a CAGR of 35.2% over the same period.

**Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations and the operating metrics discussed in this section have been, and may continue to be,
affected by the key factors set forth below as well as certain historical and future events and actions. As many of
these factors are beyond our control and certain of these factors have historically been volatile, past performance
will not necessarily be indicative of future performance and it is difficult to predict future performance with any
degree of certainty. See “Risk Factors.” We consider the following factors to be the principal drivers of our results
of operations.

**_Growth of the European online fashion market and the off-price sector_**

Our addressable market is currently experiencing favorable structural trends. We operate in the European online
off-price fashion market for mid-market to luxury brands, which is the fastest growing segment of the fashion
market. The total mid-market to luxury European fashion market (excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia)
amounted to €247 billion in revenue (of which €49 billion correspond to the off-price market) in the year ended
December 31, 2023 based on analysis prepared by a leading international strategy consultancy firm and the
Company. We operate in the online off-price market, which amounted to €20 billion in revenue across Europe
(excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia) in the year ended December 31, 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR
of 10% from 2023 to 2028 based on the analysis prepared by a leading international strategy consultancy firm and
the Company.

In recent years, we have transformed into a primarily online platform for off-price premium products. Revenue
from our online operations increased by nearly 20% between the years ended December 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2023 as a result of continued customer growth and NMV retention among our existing active online
customers. Our online revenue represented 91.9% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, as
compared to 93.0% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. From January 1, 2021 to
December 31, 2023, our number of active online customers increased at a CAGR of 27.4%. We plan to maintain
a limited physical presence of premium and outlet stores in strategic locations designed primarily to support our
online platform, with offline revenue expected to remain a limited percentage of our total revenue.

While we believe that our business model is resilient to minor general economic effects, and that off-price is
typically more resilient relative to the rest of the fashion market during economic downturns, it is possible that
unfavorable macroeconomic events in Germany, and more broadly in Europe, may have a negative effect on the
growth of the European online fashion market and impact our customers and our results of operations. These
include factors that may affect consumer spending such as unemployment levels, inflation, wage rates, availability
of consumer credit and consumer confidence. For example, recent geopolitical tensions resulting from the Russian
invasion of Ukraine and the military conflict between Israel and Hamas have destabilized the global economy and
will potentially have a wide range of supply chain implications, including increases in the costs of merchandise
and disruption in freight transport.

**_Our ability to secure an attractive variety and quantity of products_**

Our results of operations and profitability depend, to a considerable extent, on our ability to source and sell a
desirable and fresh mix of merchandise at attractive prices. We need to continuously source a sufficient variety
and quantity of merchandise from sought-after brands in a cost-effective manner. Our exclusive, invitation-only
membership model creates the opportunity for our suppliers to ensure that their overstock is sold in a discreet and
controlled environment, protecting their retail pricing strategies and the desirability of their brands while allowing
them to maximize value for their overstock. Our model allows us to clearly distinguish ourselves from other
fashion clearance channels such as online shopping clubs, factory outlet centers or other retail wholesalers and
has made us an attractive and preferred partner for many of our brands when they are seeking to clear overstock.
Our unique model facilitates our early access to high-quality inventory at favorable prices.

Developments in the retail fashion industry, combined with the seasonal nature of our suppliers’ industry, may
impact the timing of our merchandise procurement and the prices at which we can procure such merchandise. For
example, favorable economic conditions in the fashion industry typically lead to increases in production volumes
by our suppliers and, consequently, may result in greater availability of overstock merchandise in the market and
an opportunity to source such excess overstock merchandise at better prices. In contrast, extended periods of
financial uncertainty or decreases in consumer spending may cause our suppliers to reduce their production,
thereby limiting the amount of merchandise on the market and negatively affecting the prices at which we can
purchase overstock merchandise.

Sufficient availability of overstock in the market can be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions, changes
to the distribution plans of our brand partners or an overall decline in the fashion market. For example, the Russian
invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has and will potentially continue to have a wide range of supply chain
implications, including increases in cost and disruption in freight transport. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to_
_Our Business and Industry—Our business depends on our ability to continuously source and present a variety_
_and quantity of attractive products from various popular brands at attractive prices that will satisfy our_
_customers’ preferences and demands.”_

In addition, weather conditions can impact the timing and availability of merchandise. A mild autumn or a cold
spring may negatively impact the sale of winter and summer merchandise, respectively, by our suppliers. This
may lead to the earlier availability of merchandise but may also result in our need to lower prices to follow price
reductions by our suppliers online and in their high street retail locations. Also, changing and increasing volatile
weather conditions are creating unforeseen seasonal demand that cannot be fully covered with planned collections
or increased availability of overstock. We have the ability to purchase large quantities of merchandise, including
mixed lots, which are lots that do not contain a typical distribution of sizes and colors, increasing our value as
counterparty to our suppliers. As a result, we are often the first choice of our suppliers, reinforcing our customer
proposition by giving us preferential access to desirable merchandise.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our cost of sales was 57.5% of our revenue and was influenced by
unfavorable overstock availability negatively impacting cost of sales, as well as a higher discounting environment,
leading us to increase our discount rate. For the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales was higher, at 57.8%
of our revenue, due to a highly competitive market environment leading to increased discount levels. For the three
months ended March 31, 2024, cost of sales was at 57.8% of our revenue, a 1.6 percentage points decrease
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, due to favorable overstock availability positively impacting
cost of materials.

**_Pricing_**

Our pricing strategy is to offer products to our customers at attractive discounts ranging from 20% to 80% of the
recommended retail price. Some of the various factors which influence our pricing strategy are beyond our control,
including market conditions, overstock availability, and demand. For example, a competitive discounting
environment could influence consumers’ price expectations, which may in turn affect our pricing strategy, while
geopolitical uncertainty and price volatility could lead to a decrease in consumer confidence and spending.

Pricing of our products more broadly has a direct impact on our revenue and profitability margin. An effective
pricing strategy ensures optimal timing and pricing levels for a product as it moves through the different
markdown stages, thereby maximizing its revenue and profit contribution. Conversely, if we fail to manage our
pricing strategy adequately, we may lose sales and forfeit profitability. An effective markdown strategy improves
the quality of our inventory by ensuring efficient stock turnover. Continuous improvements of our pricing strategy
and our pricing-related technology, including a machine learning program for automatic pricing, have contributed

to our revenue growth from the year ended December 31, 2021, to the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and,
we believe, help us to maintain healthy Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margins even in
challenging market conditions.

**_Fulfillment_**

Our fulfillment expenses, which are included in our selling and distribution expenses, comprise, among others,
costs related to content creation, warehousing, handling and packaging, shipping, payment, customer service and
returns. Our fulfillment expenses are driven by a number of factors, in particular the revenue share of our online
operations, the share of international shipping, the effectiveness of our fulfillment centers, capacity utilization, as
well as shipping and last-mile delivery costs for third-party carriers who handle the delivery of our products.

We primarily incur fulfillment expenses when we ship online orders from our fulfillment center. In the years
ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, we incurred fulfillment expenses of
€162.3 million (17.2% of our revenue), €188.9 million (18.0% of our revenue) and €221.5 million (18.1% of our
revenue), respectively. The movement in our fulfillment expenses ratio (the ratio of fulfillment expenses to
revenue) in these periods was driven by the use of temporary fulfillment centers, inflationary costs associated with
investments in new fulfillment centers, higher shipping expenses due to a higher share of international business
and increased personnel expenses in logistics as a result of a higher business volume.

Fulfillment expenses are expected to increase as a result of growth in our business, but we expect this ratio to
improve in the coming years. While we expect to continue experiencing increases in our shipping costs per item
as a result of the growing international share of our business, we aim to offset these increases with a switch to
local last-mile carriers once we have reached sufficient scale in the respective country as well as through volume
discounts (despite price increases by some of our last-mile carriers). In addition, we expect to realize cost synergies
following the ramp-up of the new fulfillment center in Poland, combined with increased automation as well as
process optimization, to decrease our fulfillment expenses base per item.

**_New customer acquisition_**

Our closed membership model and our loyalty program – the VIP Program – are designed to trigger invitations
(and therefore viral new customer acquisition) by rewarding customers for successfully inviting other members.
New viral customers (customers who have been invited by existing customers) are the primary drivers of our yearon-year structural revenue growth and an important driver for our expansion. Our online business has grown at a
CAGR of over 20% from the year ended December 31, 2019, to the year ended December 31, 2023. Moreover,
viral customer growth is highly cost-efficient, with a low single-digit percentage of total revenue being spent
annually on viral engine-related expenses.

To complement our viral engine model, we introduced our new paid customer acquisition strategy during the
second quarter of 2021. Our paid marketing efforts allow us to invite potential new members to join our closed
membership model so that they can drive viral growth by using their invitation rights to invite new members,
accelerating our viral customer growth. Our paid marketing efforts are targeted towards specific customer
demographics and regions to drive our non-viral growth, especially in areas with currently lower penetration (such
as Northern Germany and our international markets). This “seeding” strategy is very effective with a highly
favorable marketing efficiency ratio (defined as incremental revenue generated from our paid marketing strategy
divided by marketing spend). Our paid marketing strategy has contributed 28% and 24% of our total increase in
new customers in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The customer base
we gain from our paid marketing strategy is supported by subsequent viral growth in the customer base, resulting
in strong marketing efficiency with €5.50 in average revenue per €1.00 in marketing spend from 2019 to 2023.
See “Our Business—Marketing—Paid customer acquisition.”

Our predominantly viral customer generation ensures high active customer growth with low marketing
investment. This has enabled us to keep our marketing costs structurally low. For example, for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, we incurred an average marketing costs of 1.3% and 1.9% of revenue,
respectively. Our LTV/CAC ratio is defined as cumulative PCII per online customer since first order, actuals
(LTV). PCII is defined as gross margin minus fulfillment costs (incl. payments and customer care). CAC
(customer acquisition costs) is defined as total marketing expenses / total number of new customers. The following
graph reflects the LTV/CAC ratio for the 2019 and 2023 period and illustrates our ability to maintain short payback
periods on our marketing costs with steadily increasing trends:

75


-----

The expenses we incur for our viral customer growth model, such as vouchers earned by customers for
successfully inviting other members, are reflected as sales deductions within revenue until December 31, 2022.
As of January 1, 2023, we are able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the vouchers earned by customers for
successfully inviting other members. Consequently, we capitalize the corresponding customer acquisition costs
as costs for obtaining a contract. The expenses of marketing activities, including our paid customer acquisition
strategy, are included in our selling and distribution expenses. In the years ended December 31, 2021,
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, we incurred marketing expenses of €49.0 million, €20.3 million and
€21.1 million, respectively.

**_Payment Options_**

A variety of payment options is an important aspect of the shopping experience for our customers. We offer
different payment methods tailored to meet our members’ payment preferences, both in our offline retail stores
and our online platform, including credit cards, PayPal, direct debit, instant bank transfer and pay-by-invoice
(“buy-now-pay-later”). As part of our internationalization strategy, we are also focusing on making more local
payments methods available to our customers. Furthermore, we tailor our payment solutions by customer type and
offer certain payment options, such as pay-by-invoice, only to customers who have a sufficient purchase history
with us.

Customers’ choices of payment method can have a significant effect on our profitability. For example, revenue
can vary by up to 2% based on the payment methods available in Germany. In addition, certain payment options
can have better order economics than others, for example through lower return rates.

**_Investments in infrastructure_**

Our result of operations and cash flows are influenced by our investments in technology and fulfillment center
infrastructure.

Our business depends significantly on our ability to process transactions on secure information systems and to
store, retrieve, process and manage information. In the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2023, we invested €24.2 million, €28.8 million and €33.3 million, respectively, and in the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, we invested €7.2 million and €9.6 million, respectively, in
technology-related capital expenditures mainly pertaining to the upgrade of our IT-system to strengthen our
technological capabilities and in-house excellence. Our primary front-office technology systems are used to
market products to end customers, to manage, track and deliver orders, and to monitor stock and interface with
suppliers and other business relations. We have invested significantly in the overall user-experience of our
customer-facing systems, as well as in marketing and analytics capabilities to boost customer acquisition, increase
sales conversion, and manage churn. We updated our online platform to support multiple currencies and to be

76


-----

available in multiple languages. We also expanded the platform’s payment capabilities to provide better and more
flexible options for different customer needs. In addition, we made investments in the scalability of the technology
architecture across systems and processes, to support future growth of the business and to manage orders more
efficiently. We have also invested in an upgrade of our IT systems.

We operate a modern fulfillment center in Poing, Germany, near Munich. The site, which was extended in 2019
and 2020, now has a footprint of 48,000 square meters and can hold approximately 10 million items of inventory.
The site also features multi-channel processes and also supplies our retail stores. We also operate a second largescale fulfillment center in Poland, which we began operating in the second quarter of 2023 with a footprint of
120,000 square meters. Lower wages in the Polish facility, as well as increasing automation over the next few
years, are expected to result in a lower operating expense per item.

**_Returns_**

Allowing our customers to easily receive, try on, and if required, return products free of charge is an important
part of our value proposition to our customers, contributing to customer satisfaction, supporting customer
conversion (from browsing to purchasing) and increasing customer lifetime value. A number of factors influence
our return rates, such as products not matching their online description, issues with product quality, unexpected
variations in sizes, or wrong items being shipped.

We continuously seek to optimize our return rates and minimize the costs associated with our free return policy
by focusing on the accuracy of our product descriptions, including size recommendations, and improving the
visualizations of our products on our apps and websites, avoiding returns where possible. Furthermore, we focus
on providing an efficient and reliable fulfillment process to make sure the right items are shipped and arrive in a
timely fashion.

In accordance with IFRS, we use our historical return rates to anticipate future returns and to deduct such
anticipated returns from our revenue and cost of materials. If actual return rates turn out to be higher, we lose the
corresponding share of revenue and profits. More than 99% of the products returned are recorded as inventory
and are available for sale again having undergone a quality assessment to ensure the return products are in good
order. We provision in our accounts for the expected loss margin from returns and less than 1% of return products
are damaged or otherwise not fit for sale.

**_Internationalization_**

We operate in the European online off-price fashion market for mid-market to luxury fashion, which currently
presents several highly attractive market dynamics to participants. Our unique proposition provides us with the
opportunity to continuously capture market share and participate in the structural growth momentum of our
market. Our approach to accelerate our international growth follows the following three stages: (1) create relevant
brand assortment, (2) localize the customer experience (with local language, website, payment methods, carrier
and customer care), improve shipment costs and invest in social media marketing, (3) drive predominantly viral
customer growth which in turn yields cyclical growth. We have successfully expanded our international business
in recent years, with the proportion of our revenue derived from our International segment steadily increasing,
and amounting to 28.4%, 34.0% and 39.9% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021,
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and 39.5% and 43.7% in the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Our International segment revenue, which amounted to €267.5
million, €357.8 million and €489.2 million, in the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2023, respectively, experienced a CAGR of 35.2% for the same period, compared to our Germany
segment revenue, which amounted to €675.4 million, €693.3 million and €736.8 million, in the years ended
December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a CAGR of 4.5% for the
same period.

**_Seasonality_**

Our business is seasonal, which is typical for retailers in the fashion industry. For example, we typically experience
an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of the year due to several special sales events (e.g., Black Friday sale,
Cyber Week sale and the Christmas shopping season). Following exceptional revenue growth due to the structural
shift towards online shopping due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2021, we experienced a
normalization of our fourth quarter revenue in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, during
which revenue in the fourth quarter accounted for 32.6% and 33.0% of our total revenue for the year, respectively,
as a result of the readjustment of the online and offline retail sectors post COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of our

77


-----

seasonality of sales, any factors that harm our operating results during the fourth quarter of a year, including
unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainties caused by inflation and macroeconomic conditions affecting
consumer spending levels or inclement weather that deters customers from buying online or visiting our stores,
could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the full year.

Our growth rate fluctuates from quarter to quarter, and we expect that it will continue to do so because of a variety
of factors, including the timing and success of our international marketing activities, the share of revenue driven
by promotional activities, seasonality and economic cycles that influence retail apparel purchase trends.

Furthermore, our pricing is influenced by the seasonality of our industry and the impact of weather patterns and
conditions. For example, if a fall/winter season is unusually warm, we may fail to sell some of the merchandise
for the season, resulting in pricing pressure on the same merchandise in the following fall/winter season.

In addition, our Operating Net Working Capital is affected by seasonal trading patterns. Our Operating Net
Working Capital typically reaches a peak from June to September, with a minimum position in January after the
Christmas season has passed.

**Key Items of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income**

Set forth below is a brief description of the key line items of our consolidated statement of comprehensive income:

**_Revenue_**

We generate our revenue primarily from the sale of fashion merchandise on our BestSecret online platform and
to a lesser extent from sales in our retail stores. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of the goods to the customer.
Revenue is recorded net of sales deductions, taxes and duties. For transactions with a statutory 14-day or longer
refund policy, we calculate the amount of the expected returns as of the reporting date based on historical return
rates under consideration of the actual returns until the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements.
We present the expected returns of goods on a gross basis and reduce revenue by the full number of sales that are
estimated to be returned. The sale of goods that is recorded in full upon delivery of the goods is then corrected by
the estimated number of returns. Vouchers earned by customers for successfully inviting other members represent
a payment to customers and therefore were reflected as a revenue reduction when redeemed by the customer until
December 31, 2022. As of January 1, 2023, we are able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the vouchers
earned by customers for successfully inviting other members. Consequently, we capitalize the corresponding
customer acquisition costs as costs for obtaining a contract. Revenue also includes revenue received from shipping
fees charged to customers when merchandise is purchased. In addition, we purchase some products, such as
jewelry, on a commission basis. In this case, we act as an agent, but are free in the setting of prices. Moreover, we
enable selected partners to sell goods directly to BestSecret’s closed customer community over our Curated
Platform. In both cases, revenue is earned in the amount of the commission received. Revenue is recognized within
our two operating segments, Germany and International.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Our cost of sales comprises primarily cost of goods sold, expenses for inbound logistics, allowances on inventories
and other costs in connection with sales. Cost of goods sold equals expenses for goods sold less discounts and
rebates granted by suppliers. Expenses for inbound logistics include all expenses incurred before the inventories
are stored in the fulfillment centers and consist mainly of customs and incoming goods transport expenses.
Allowances of inventories reflect write-downs of inventories to the net realizable value to account for risks from
reduced demand or quality of the goods. Other cost of sales also covers cost for the storage of goods and expenses
for depreciation.

**_Selling and Distribution Expenses_**

Our selling and distribution expenses comprise fulfillment expenses, sales expenses, and marketing expenses, as
well as amortization, depreciation and impairment expenses. Fulfillment expenses mainly consist of expenses for
outbound and return logistics including delivery costs and personnel costs associated with these processes. Sales
expenses primarily include payment costs and personnel expenses as well as incidental rental costs of the stores.

for software and maintenance fees as well as consultancy fees and sundry general administrative expenses.

**_Other Operating Income_**

Our other operating income mainly comprises foreign exchange rate gains, income from affiliated companies,
income from reversal of provisions and accruals, compensations for damages, income relating to other periods,
and sundry other operating income. COVID-19 related lockdown revenue compensation is also recognized in
other operating income.

**_Other Operating Expenses_**

Other operating expenses mainly consist of foreign exchange rate losses, expenses for recharges by the parent
company, expenses relating to other periods, bad debt losses and sundry other operating expenses.

**_Financial Income_**

Our financial income includes valuation of embedded derivatives, income from exchange rate differences, credit
interest, interest income from affiliated companies, income from hedge ineffectiveness, subleases, tax refunds and
sundry interest income.

**_Financial Expenses_**

drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility as well as commitment fees related to the availability of the
Revolving Credit Facility, interest expenses on lease liabilities, interest expenses on short-term liabilities, interest
expenses on liabilities from affiliated companies and interest expenses on hedge ineffectiveness.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by €64.6 million, or 24.5%, from €263.5 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, to €328.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily driven
by the increase in our customer base and strong customer order economics paired with a successful
internationalization strategy.

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by €33.0 million, or 21.1%, from €156.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, to €189.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to
the overall business growth. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.6 percentage points from
59.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the 57.8% for the three months ended March 31,
2024. This was primarily driven by favorable overstock availability positively impacting cost of materials, and by
lower discount aggressiveness in the market.

_Selling and distribution expenses_

Our selling and distribution expenses increased by €14.5 million, or 18.1%, from €80.2 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023, to €94.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was
primarily due to a higher order volume and higher shipping expenses in the period of which a higher share was
international business. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 30.4% for the
three months ended March 31, 2023, to 28.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The fulfillment
expenses ratio (the ratio of fulfillment expenses to revenue) was 18.2% for the three months ended March 31,
2024 (for the three months ended March 31, 2023: 18.9%). For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the selling
and distribution expenses consisted mainly of fulfillment expenses of €59.7 million (for the three months ended
March 31, 2023: €49.7 million), marketing expenses of €6.1 million (for the three months ended March 31, 2023:
€3.4 million), sales expenses of €8.5 million (for the three months ended March 31, 2023: €8.8 million) and
amortization and depreciation expenses of €20.4 million (for the three months ended March 31, 2023: €18.3
million).

_Administrative expenses_

Our administrative expenses increased by €4.9 million, or 20.5%, from €23.9 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, to €28.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to
higher technology and administrative expenses due to increased internal and external personnel expense. In the
three months ended March 31, 2024, administrative expenses consist of technology expenses of €8.5 million (for
the three months ended March 31, 2023: €5.9 million), general and administrative expenses of €17.7 million (for
the three months ended March 31, 2023: €15.9 million) and amortization and depreciation expenses of €2.6
million (for the three months ended March 31, 2023: €2.0 million).

_Other operating income_

Our other operating income decreased by €0.2 million from €0.9 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, to €0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Changes to other operating income
in the period mainly resulted from compensations for damages and income from foreign currency exchange
differences and income relating to other periods.

_Other operating expenses_

Our other operating expenses decreased by €0.3 million from €1.6 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, to €1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Other operating expenses mainly
consist of foreign currency exchange losses.

_Financial income_

Financial income decreased by €3.7 million from €5.7 million for the first three months ended March 31, 2023,
to €2.0 million for the first three months ended March 31, 2024. The financial income decreased mainly because
no financial income was recognized for the valuation of embedded derivatives for the three months ended March
31, 2024 (financial income recognized for the valuation of embedded derivatives for the three months ended
March 31, 2023: €5.3 million).

_Financial expenses_

Our financial expenses increased by €7.1 million, or 57.7%, from €12.3 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, to €19.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Financial expenses mainly consist
of interest on the Existing Notes and lease liabilities under IFRS16. The increase in financial expenses was mainly
due to increased costs for the Existing Notes as well as negative change in fair value for embedded derivatives
resulting in financial expenses of €1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (no financial expenses
was recognized for the valuation of embedded derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2023).

_Income taxes_

Our income taxes changed by €0.7 million from €0.7 million tax income for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, to €0.0 million tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This development is
primarily due to increased earnings from operations.

_Net income/(net loss) for the period_

Our net loss for the period amounted to €3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a
net loss for the period of €3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, representing a decrease of €0.6
million. The decrease in net loss for the period were mainly due to the increase in earnings before interest and
taxes, partially offset by the increase in financial expenses.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by €175.0 million, or 16.7%, from €1,051.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,
to €1,226.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the growth in
the number of active customers paired with robust order economics and successful international expansion.

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by €104.3 million, or 17.3%, from €604.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2022, to €708.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 corresponding to 57.8% (for the year ended
December 31, 2022: 57.5%) of revenue. This development is attributable to the growth in the number of active
customers paired with robust order economics and successful international expansion. Cost of materials of €699.7
million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €596.9 million), depreciation of property, plant and equipment
and amortization of intangible assets of €0.9 million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €1.0 million) and
personnel expenses of €7.9 million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €6.3 million) are reported in cost of
sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.

_Selling and distribution expenses_

Our selling and distribution expenses increased by €45.1 million, or 14.4%, from €313.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, to €359.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven
by higher fulfillment expenses resulting from higher shipping expenses due to a higher share of international
business and increased personnel expenses in logistics due to higher business volumes as well as higher
amortization, depreciation and impairment expenses. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue
decreased from 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, our selling and distribution expenses consisted of fulfillment expenses of
€221.5 million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €188.9 million), marketing expenses of €21.1 million (for
the year ended December 31, 2022: €20.3 million), sales expenses of €37.2 million (for the year ended December
31, 2022: €33.2 million) and amortization, depreciation and impairment expenses of €79.1 million (for the year
ended December 31, 2022: €71.5 million). The fulfillment expenses increased by €32.6 million from the year
ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2023, which was mainly due to higher shipping
expenses due to a higher share of international business and increased personnel expenses in logistics due to higher
business volumes. As a result, the fulfillment expenses ratio (the ratio of fulfillment expenses to revenue) came
to 18.1% in the year ended December 31, 2023 (for the year ended December 31, 2022: 18.0%). In the year ended
December 31, 2023, marketing expenses equaled 1.7% (for the year ended December 31, 2022: 1.9%) of revenue.
This decrease in marketing expenses was mainly due to lower spending with a shorter payback period in light of
the volatile market environment as well as increased efficiencies of the paid customer acquisition activities. Sales
expenses increased to €16.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 (for the year ended December 31, 2022:
€14.2 million) due to higher expenses for payment service providers. Personnel expenses for the stores increased
by €1.6 million to €14.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 (for the year ended December 31, 2022:
€13.2 million). As a result, the sales expenses ratio (the ratio of sales expenses to revenue) came to 3.0% in the
year ended December 31, 2023 (for the year ended December 31, 2022: 3.2%). Amortization, depreciation and
impairment expenses increased to €79.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 (for the year ended
December 31, 2022: €71.5 million), and primarily comprised amortization of brand names and customer base of
€48.8 million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €48.8 million).

_Administrative expenses_

Our administrative expenses decreased by €0.3 million, or 0.3%, from €94.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, to €94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in administrative
expenses was primarily driven by lower technology expenses, partially offset by higher general administrative
expenses. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our administrative expenses consisted of technology expenses of
€24.9 million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €27.9 million), general and administrative expenses of
€59.9 million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €58.8 million) and depreciation of property, plant and
equipment and amortization of intangible assets of €9.3 million (for the year ended December 31, 2022: €7.7
million). Technology expenses decreased by €3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the
year ended December 31, 2022, which was mainly attributable to a higher share of capitalized personnel costs.
Compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, the general and administrative expenses increased by €1.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to general administrative expenses and service expenses with
Holdco partly offset by lower personnel expenses. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization
of intangible assets increased by €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended
December 31, 2022 due to higher amortization of intangible assets as a result of our ongoing investments in tech
and data to further improve our IT systems.

_Other operating income_

Our other operating income increased by €3.1 million, or 64.6%, from €4.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, to €7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other operating income mainly
comprises income from foreign exchange rate gains, income from affiliated companies and reversal of provisions
and accruals.

_Other operating expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €0.7 million, or 11.1%, from €6.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, to €7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to
foreign exchange rate losses, expenses for recharges by the parent company and expenses related to other periods.

_Financial income_

Our financial income increased by €9.6 million from €6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to €16.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to valuation of embedded
derivatives, income from exchange rate differences, credit interest and interest income from affiliated companies.

_Financial expenses_

Our financial expenses increased by €22.4 million, or 57.1%, from €39.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2022, to €61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to interest expenses in connection with the
Existing Notes and higher interest expenses on lease liabilities under IFRS 16 and short-term liabilities.

_Income taxes_

Our income taxes increased by €5.4 million from €2.4 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022,
to €7.8 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to higher taxable income as a result of
increasing business volumes.

_Net income/(net loss) for the period_

Our net income for the period amounted to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the
net income of €12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of €10.2 million. The
increase in net income was attributable to the growth of our overall business in the year ended December 31, 2023.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by €108.1 million, or 11.5%, from €942.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021,
to €1,051.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue growth was driven by the growth in the
number of active customers combined with robust order economics. The international segment drove this growth
with a revenue increase of €90.3 million, from €267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to €357.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by €91.6 million, or 17.9%, from €512.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2021, to €604.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in the
costs of materials as a result of the increased orders, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation of property,
plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 57.5% for
the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase
was primarily due to overall business growth. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of

-----

intangible assets of €1.0 million (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €1.5 million) and personnel expenses of
€6.3 million (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €6.0 million) are reported in cost of sales for the year ended
December 31, 2022.

_Selling and distribution expenses_

Our selling and distribution expenses decreased by €4.9 million, or 1.5%, from €318.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €313.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to
decreases in marketing expenses and amortization and impairment of intangible assets partially offset by increased
fulfillment costs, sales expenses, and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. For the reasons described
above, selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 33.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2021, to 29.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our selling and distribution expenses consisted of fulfillment expenses of
€188.9 million (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €162.3 million), marketing expenses of €20.3 million (for
the year ended December 31, 2021: €49.0 million), sales expenses of €33.2 million (for the year ended December
31, for the year ended December 31, 2021: €28.9 million) and amortization, depreciation and impairment expenses
of €71.5 million (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €78.6 million). The fulfillment expenses increased by
€26.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 which was
mainly due to a higher share of international business and increased personnel expenses in logistics as a result of
higher international business volume. As a result, the fulfillment expenses ratio (the ratio of fulfillment expenses
to revenue) came to 18.0% in the year ended December 31, 2022 (for the year ended December 31, 2021: 17.2%).
In the year ended December 31, 2022, marketing expenses equaled 1.9% (for the year ended December 31, 2021:
5.2%) of our revenue. The decrease in marketing expenses was mainly due to increased efficiencies of the paid
customer acquisition activities. Compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, sales expenses increased by €4.3
million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in costs for
payment service providers, which amounted to €14.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 (for the year
ended December 31, 2021: €12.8 million) and personnel expenses for the stores in the amount of €13.2 million in
the year ended December 31, 2022 (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €11.5 million), due to the fact that the
2021 figure was positively influenced by the receipt of government grants for short-term workers in our stores in
Germany and Austria during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year ended December 31, 2022, amortization,
depreciation and impairment expenses decreased to €71.5 million (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €78.6
million), and primarily comprised amortization of brand names and customer base of €48.8 million (for the year
ended December 31, 2021: €58.7 million). This decrease was predominately due to the fact that the brand name
Schustermann & Borenstein was fully amortized in the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Administrative expenses_

Our administrative expenses increased by €15.3 million, or 19.3%, from €79.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase of administrative
expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel expenses and technology expenses related to IT-licenses and
maintenance as well as higher consultancy fees. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our administrative expenses
consist of technology expenses of €27.9 million (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €21.3 million), general
and administrative expenses of €58.8 million (for the year ended December 31, 2021: €51.7 million) and
depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets of €7.7 million (for the year
ended December 31, 2021: €6.1 million).

_Other operating income_

Our other operating income increased by €2.0 million, or 71.4%, from €2.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly attributable
to income from foreign exchange rate gains, reversal of provisions and accruals, and income relating to other
periods.

_Other operating expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €2.7 million from €3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021,
to €6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to increased foreign
exchange rate losses and other expenses in connection with a new fulfillment center, levies in lieu of employing
persons with severe disabilities and expenses for voluntary social benefits.

-----

_Financial income_

Our financial income increased by €6.8 million from €0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to €6.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the positive change in fair value of the Existing Notes’
embedded derivative.

_Financial expenses_

Our financial expenses increased by €13.1 million, or 50.2%, from €26.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2021, to €39.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Financial expenses mainly consisted of interest on
the Existing Notes and lease liabilities under IFRS 16.

_Income taxes_

Our income taxes increased by €0.8 million from €1.6 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021,
to €2.4 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. This development is primarily due to a
decreased release of deferred tax liabilities in connection with a shortening of the useful life for the customer base
of “Schustermann & Borenstein” as a result of our rebranding.

_Net income/(net loss) for the year_

Our net income for the period amounted to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net
income for the period of €3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of €1.8
million. The decrease was attributable to a lower gross margin, higher fulfillment and administrative costs as well
as increased negative financial result, partly offset by lower marketing costs.

for the year ended December 31, 2022, to €55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in
International Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies was primarily due to a strong revenue growth
of 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. International
Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin increased by 2.4 percentage points from 9.0% for the
year ended December 31, 2022, to 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of lower shipping
expenses, lower marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, as well as a better absorption of general and
administrative expenses. See “Internationalization––Results of Operations.”

International Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies increased by €8.6 million from €23.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021, to €32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in
International Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies was primarily due to a strong revenue growth
of 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. International
Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin increased by 0.2 percentage point from 8.8% for the
year ended December 31, 2021 to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of lower marketing
expenses.

(a) Represents non-recurring, extraordinary and other non-operational items as described under “Summary Consolidated Financial and
_Other Information—Other Financial Data.”_

(b) Represents expected cost synergies from the fulfillment center network expansion from Q4 2022 onwards and until the fulfillment
center in Poland is fully operational. The expected cost synergies result from improved unit economics on the basis of capacity
optimization (reduction of utilization rate of existing fulfillment center and the elimination of the need to rent additional warehouse
capacity) as well as from wage and automation benefits.

International Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA increased by €8.5 million from €10.4 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023, to €18.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. International Run Rate
Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 3.2 percentage points from 10.0% for the three months ended March 31,
2023, to 13.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a more favorable
purchasing environment, an increased share of margin accretive brands in the assortment following
implementation of the company’s Elevation Strategy, and the expanded fulfillment center network.

International Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA increased by €28.8 million from €34.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, to €62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in International Run
Rate Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to further international expansion and the extended customer base.
International Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 3.3 percentage points from 9.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2022, to 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of more favorable
purchasing conditions, an increase in average selling prices and the positive impact of the expanded fulfillment
center network, especially in the peak fourth quarter. See “Internationalization––Results of Operations.”

International Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA increased by €10.4 million from €23.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in International Run
Rate Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to further international expansion and the extended customer base.
International Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased by 0.7 percentage points from 8.8% for the year
ended December 31, 2021, to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the viral customer growth
model which allowed us to further expand our customer base.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our main sources of liquidity are our net cash flows from operating activities and long-term financing, including
the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

Our business model is focused on ensuring adequate liquidity to allow for flexibility with regard to the purchase
of merchandise, including opportunistic mixed lot purchases. Given our positive liquidity situation, we are able
to procure merchandise through our operating cash generation, providing us with flexibility which we believe
particularly appeals to our suppliers.

On July 14, 2022, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will be amended and restated
by the RCF Amendment and Restatement Agreement which we expect to be entered into on or around the date of
this Offering Memorandum, totaling €110.0 million (of which €12.1 million thereof constitute guarantees
reducing the credit line). We expect the RCF Amendment and Restatement Agreement to become effective on the
Issue Date. The facility increased our flexibility with regard to the financing of our increased working capital
needs due to our growing business volume and the seasonality of the fashion business, as well as our growth
investments into a new fulfillment center and a notably improved tech and data structure.

Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn
dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.”

Although we believe that our expected net cash flows from operating activities, together with the borrowings that
will be available under the Notes and Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity
and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient net cash flows from

operating activities or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay
our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to our Financial Profile—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be_
_forced to take other actions to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table sets forth the principal components of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021,
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.

_Net cash flows from operating activities_

Our net cash flows from operating activities increased by €13.2 million from net cash outflows of €19.9 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2023, to net cash outflows of €6.7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. The decrease in net cash outflows from operating activities was primarily due to higher EBITDA.

Our net cash flows from operating activities increased by €77.6 million from net cash inflows of €75.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, to net cash inflows of €152.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The increase in net cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase of trade and other
payables and higher EBITDA.

Our net cash flows from operating activities decreased by €14.0 million from net cash inflows of €89.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021, to net cash inflows of €75.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The decrease in net cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net working capital.

_Net cash flows from investing activities_

Our net cash flows from investing activities decreased by €2.5 million from net cash outflows of €8.6 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2023, to net cash outflows of €11.1 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities was primarily due to an increase in
investments in tech and data to further improve the IT systems.

Our net cash flows from investing activities decreased by €25.4 million from net cash outflows of €40.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022, to net cash outflows of €65.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2023. The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities was primarily due to investments in property,
plant and equipment related to the fulfillment center network expansion in Poland.

Our net cash flows from investing activities decreased by €12.1 million from net cash outflows of €28.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021, to net cash outflows of €40.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2022. The increase in net cash outflows for investing activities was primarily due to investments in capitalized
development costs for internally generated software and from investment in property, plant and equipment related
to the fulfillment center network expansion in Poland.

_Net cash flows from financing activities_

Our net cash flows from financing activities decreased by €8.5 million from net cash outflows of €7.8 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2023, to net cash outflows of €16.3 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. The increase in net cash outflows from financing activities was primarily due to higher interest
payments in connection with the Existing Notes.

-----

Our net cash flows from financing activities increased by €11.6 million from net cash outflows of €7.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, to net cash inflows of €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The increase in net cash inflows from financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds in connection with
the 2023 tap offering of the Existing Notes exceeding the interest payments.

Our net cash flows from financing activities increased by €22.9 million from net cash outflows of €30.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021, to net cash outflows of €7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The decrease in net cash outflows from financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds of the Existing
Notes exceeding the repayment of the previously existing notes, offset by transaction costs for the Existing Notes
and our Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Capital Expenditure_**

We calculate Capital Expenditure as the sum of (i) purchase of property, plant and equipment, (ii) purchase of
intangible assets and (iii) capitalized development costs, each as shown in the consolidated statements of cash
flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements and as shown in the table below for the periods indicated.

**Capital Expenditure (unaudited) .............** **28.7** **37.5** **65.8** **8.6** **11.1**

Our Capital Expenditure in the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily related to the expansion of our
fulfillment center in Poing, Germany and an upgrade of our IT systems. Our Capital Expenditure in the years
ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, as well as the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily
related to the new fulfillment center in Poland and the ongoing upgrade of our IT systems.

We also classify our Capital Expenditure between maintenance and expansion. Maintenance capital expenditure
mainly relate to refurbishment of our stores, maintenance of our facilities and infrastructure, including our head
office in Munich. Expansion capital expenditure mainly relate to the expansion of our facilities and infrastructure,
including our fulfillment centers, IT upgrades as well as new store opening.

The table below presents our expansion and maintenance Capital Expenditure for the periods indicated:

_thereof expansion ..........................................._ 19.8 28.0 57.0 8.0 9.6

Our Capital Expenditure increased by €2.5 million, from €8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023,
to €11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly due to non-recurring growth investments in
our fulfillment center network and technology and data development seeking to continue building our
technological foundation and user experience.

Our Capital Expenditure increased by €28.3 million, from €37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,
to €65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 mainly due to non-recurring growth investments in our
fulfillment center network with the opening of a new fulfillment center in Poland.

Our Capital Expenditure increased by €8.8 million, from €28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to
€37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 mainly due to initial investments related to the new
fulfillment center in Poland.

91


-----

Our budgeted Capital Expenditure for the year ending December 31, 2024, which amounts to €97 million, is
expected to be significantly higher than in the previous years due to further investments in our fulfillment center
network to support our continued growth and improve our cost efficiency on fulfillment. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

The investments in our IT systems are comprised of capitalizable development costs and purchases of software to
support our business development. The capitalizable development costs are related to the BestSecret website and
mobile app software for services that are rendered by both Group employees as well as by external services
providers. Our IT department enables us to develop key components of the software (homepage and app) used by
the Group. This gives us a strategic advantage and enables us to align the software with the operating processes.

**_Operating Net Working Capital_**

We define “Operating Net Working Capital” as the sum of (i) inventories and prepayments for inventories,
(ii) trade and other receivables, (iii) trade and other payables and (iv) others. Others includes refund liabilities and
assets for the right to recover possession of goods for expected returns, as well as liabilities in connection with its
supply chain financing.

Our Operating Net Working Capital shows seasonal patterns with investments in inventory generally reaching a
peak in August and September due to purchase of winter merchandise. The development of our Operating Net
Working Capital is a key factor for our operating cash flow. The following table presents our Operating Net
Working Capital as of the reporting dates indicated:

(1) In the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the Issuer changed the presentation of liabilities in connection with its existing
reverse factoring supply chain financing arrangements in the consolidated statement of financial position. The liabilities from supply
chain financing were reclassified from line item “trade and other payables” to line item “other current financial liabilities” in order to
improve the informative value of the consolidated financial statements and increase comparability with other companies. The
comparative figures as of December 31, 2022 have been adjusted in the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements accordingly.
As a result, certain figures in the Group’s statement of financial position information as of December 31, 2022, included in this table
have been taken from the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) The liabilities in connection with supply chain financing as of the year ended December 31, 2021, which amounted to €9.8 million, is
presented as part of trade and other payables.

Operating Net Working Capital increased by €18.3 million, from €178.7 million as of December 31, 2023 to
€197.0 million as of March 31, 2024, primarily due to higher inventory level on the back of a scaling business,
higher trade and other receivables due to increase in cash in transit (as a result of revenue increase) as well as
lower trade payables driven by improved payment terms with suppliers after conscious efforts to re-negotiate
supply terms, which was partly offset by increased supply chain financing from working capital optimization
efforts. Operating Net Working Capital as ratio of revenue increased from 14.6% as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023, to 15.3% as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

Operating Net Working Capital decreased by €11.8 million, from €190.5 million as of December 31, 2022, to
€178.7 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher trade payables for inventory purchases and higher
utilization of supply chain financing, which more than offset the further increased level of inventories. Operating

Operating Net Working Capital increased by €38.6 million, from €151.9 million as of December 31, 2021, to
€190.5 million as of December 31, 2022, mainly due to a higher inventory level. Operating Net Working Capital
as a percentage of revenue increased from 16.1% as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 18.1% as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**_Maturity of Financial Liabilities_**

**_Other Financial Obligations and Contingent Liabilities_**

As of December 31, 2023, we had short-term obligations not recognized as liabilities on the consolidated
statement of financial position amounting to €0.2 million which include obligations from short-term lease
payments. As of December 31, 2023, we had other financial obligations amounting to €46.3 million mainly
including obligations resulting from service contracts, licenses and IT maintenance and personnel related
agreements. As of March 31, 2024, there have been no other material changes to the commitments and contingent
liabilities as presented in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023.

As of March 31, 2024, we are not involved in any significant court cases or threatened legal disputes.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures on Risk**

We are exposed to a number of risks arising from our normal business activities.

**_Market Risk_**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other
price risk, such as equity price risk.

The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to our position as of December 31, 2023. The sensitivity
analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net liabilities, the ratio of fixed to floating interest
rates of the liabilities and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant. The
analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of provisions, the nonfinancial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

93


-----

_Interest Rate Risk_

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, the Existing Notes are affected by floating interest
rates.

Sensitivity of our earnings to a change in underlying interest rates by a rise of 100 basis points and a fall of 100
basis points on variable-rate loans and borrowings as well as on the present value of derivative financial
instruments and interest rate swaps are evaluated. Changes in the market interest rates of interest rate derivatives
have an impact on the financial result and are therefore taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.

We use derivatives to manage our interest risks. In January 2023, we entered into two hedging agreements to
mitigate its exposure to interest rate risks arising from the Existing Notes. We apply hedge accounting and
recognizes the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges in line item. Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized
immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods
in which the hedged item affects net income. We intend to continue to leverage derivative instruments in
connection with the Notes.

The agreements of the hedging instruments were conducted on January 23, 2023 and January 25, 2023,
respectively, and have both the maturity date on January 15, 2026. The total nominal value is €200 million. The
hedging instruments are contracted to achieve a 1:1 hedge ratio on an economic basis to ensure an economic
relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. For accounting purposes certain ineffectiveness may
result as the derivatives and the underlying are not totally consistent. The maturity date of the hedged item is on
July 15, 2027.

This implies that the major part of the hedged item’s duration has been hedged. Under the hedge agreements, we
receive variable rates of EURIBOR on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 and pay fixed rates of
interest of 3.066% and 3.089%, respectively, on the same periods.

We assess whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective
in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. The effectiveness
of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument are determined based on
maturities, interest rates and nominal amounts. The hypothetical derivative method is used to check whether the
designated derivatives effectively hedge the cash flows of the hedged items. In the hedge relationships, the main
sources of ineffectiveness are the credit risk of the counterparties and changes in the timing of the hedged highly
probable future transactions.

In the year ended December 31, 2023, cumulative effect from cash flow hedge of €1.1 million (in the year ended
December 31, 2022: nil) was recognized directly in equity. In the year ended December 31, 2023, a gain of €0.2
million (in the year ended December 31, 2022: nil) from hedge accounting ineffectiveness was recognized in the
result for the period, as the hedging relationship was not completely effective.

_Foreign Currency Risk_

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of
changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect from currency differences on the financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2023, is mainly attributable to translation of certain lease liabilities and loans into our
functional currency. The exposure of this effect on the financial statements is expected to remain at this level.
Other than that, our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant.

**_Credit risk and risk concentration_**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer
contract, leading to a financial loss.

Concentration risks arising from the delivery of goods to major customers are subject to a special credit watch. In
the case of a return debit, we have implemented a dunning process operated by an external service provider. The
maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking account of any collateral, is represented by
their carrying amount. We offer, under certain conditions, purchase on account. Due to the introduction of nonrecourse factoring, there is no exposure to credit risk as of December 31, 2023.

We are exposed to credit risk from our operating activities (primarily trade and other receivables, including
receivables from payment service providers not holding a banking license) and from our financing activities,
including deposits with banks and financial institutions. We do not hold collateral as security. There were no
significant credit risks or concentration of risk as of December 31, 2023.

_Financial instruments and cash deposits_

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by our treasury department. Investments
of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties, which have a long-term rating of at least “A-” by
S&P or “A3” by Moody’s. The restrictions are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate
financial loss through a counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.

**Liquidity risk**

We provide sufficient liquidity for each individual entity by cash pooling. Our objective is to maintain a balance
between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank loans. We assessed the
concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. We have access to a sufficient
variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders. We
have access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding with no major debt maturing before 2027. The Revolving
Credit Facility of €110 million was not utilized as of March 31, 2024.

We also participate in a supply chain financing arrangement with the principal purpose of facilitating efficient
payment processing of supplier invoices. Although there is a concentration of risk because payables previously
distributed among a high number of creditors are now concentrated in the financial institutions involved, the
liquidity risk from supply chain financing is deemed to be low as we diversified the relevant financial instruments
among different bank partners with an investment grade rating.

The following table shows the future undiscounted cash outflows from our financial liabilities based in contractual
agreements as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

As of December 31, 2023, €128.3 million (as of December 31, 2022: €135.5 million) of contractual lease liabilities
are due to related parties. The amount disclosed relates to undiscounted contractually agreed payments. The
increase is mainly attributable to the new fulfillment center.

**Significant Accounting Policies**

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, assumptions and estimates have been made which affect the
amounts and presentation of the assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position, income and
expenses, and contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes
that may require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities in future periods.

By “significant,” we mean that the following accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results and require management’s subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to
estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. You should note that the preparation of our financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during each reporting period.

All assumptions and estimates are made according to the best of our management’s knowledge and belief in order
to present a true and fair view of our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Since the actual values
may, in individual cases, differ from the assumptions and estimates that were made, these are continuously
reviewed. Adjustments to the estimates that are relevant for the financial statements are made in the period in
which the change occurs, provided that the change relates only to this period. If the change relates not only to the
reporting period but also to subsequent periods, the change is taken into account both in the period of the change
and in subsequent periods.

**_Use of estimates and assumptions_**

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
judgements, assumptions and estimates that have effects on the amounts carried and the related disclosures.
Although these estimates are based on the current events and measures to the best of management’s knowledge,
there may be deviations between estimated and actual results. Significant estimates and assumptions have been
used for the following matters in particular:

  - Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts)

  - Determination and assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income
taxes

  - Assumptions for the calculation of returns and unredeemed coupons

  - Inventory valuation

  - Segment reporting

  - Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables

  - Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16

  - Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16

  - Assumptions with regard to notes measurement including separation of embedded derivatives

  - Assumptions with regard to fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments

  - Customer acquisition costs

  - Presentation of amounts related to supply chain financing

  - Factoring agreements

96


-----

These key forward-looking assumptions and estimates, which involve a significant risk of changing the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year, are discussed below.

_Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and the war in Ukraine)_

All non-financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are tested for impairment if there are indicators that
the asset may be impaired. Regardless of indicators of impairment, goodwill acquired in business combinations is
tested for impairment once a year at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

This assessment implies significant judgment and estimates, in particular in light of the uncertainties in connection
with the ongoing war in Ukraine. The ongoing war in Ukraine has been a source of continuous disruptions in
global supply chains, leading to inflationary pressures on the supply, shipping, and fulfillment processes of the
online market business in general. This was taken into account during the impairment testing for goodwill and the
review of useful lives for the intangible assets recognized by using the purchase method in compliance with IFRS
3. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
This is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is sensitive
to the discount rate used for the DCF model that is the basis for the calculation of the value in use as well as the
expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant
to goodwill. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the goodwill, including a
sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in Note 5.1 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

_Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes_

Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of
future taxable income. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for prior years.
Various factors such as past experience with tax field audits and different treatment of tax regulations by tax
authorities are considered.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered, which is dependent
on the generation of sufficient future taxable profit. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits
depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and
uncertainty. Consequently, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may
impact the amount of deferred tax assets recognized at the reporting date. In such circumstances, some or all of
the carrying amount of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a
corresponding credit or charge to the consolidated income statement.

_Calculation of returns and unredeemed gift vouchers_

_Returns_

For transactions with a statutory 14-day or longer refund policy, we calculate the amount of the expected returns
as of the reporting date based on historical return rates under consideration of the actual returns until the date of
preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are taken into account in order to reduce revenue. As of
December 31, 2023, deferred revenues amounted to €49.0 million (as of December 31, 2022: €38.0 million). The
right to recover possession of expected returns is reported under other current non-financial assets.

_Unredeemed gift vouchers_
The acquiring customer has a claim from the sale of vouchers for fulfillment up to a period of three years,
beginning at the end of the year in which the voucher was purchased. If vouchers sold are not redeemed within
this period, we realize the revenue from the voucher sale. Liabilities from the sale of gift vouchers are recognized
under other liabilities and amounted as of December 31, 2023, to €1.6 million (as of December 31, 2022: €2.0
million).

_Inventory valuation_

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary costs to make the sale. Estimates are necessary
to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. Further details are given in
Note 5.6 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

97


-----

_Segment reporting_

IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that
are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) for the purpose of making decisions
about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the respective segments. Since fiscal
year 2021, our segments are “Germany” and “International”. Primary emphasis is placed on the key performance
indicators, revenue and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA. We define Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted
for exceptional items and run-rate cost synergies arising from the fulfillment center network expansion. Therefore,
the reconciliation from EBITDA to Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA includes non-recurring, extraordinary and other
non-operational items as well as run rate cost synergies from the fulfillment center network expansion (calculated
as percentage of revenue). The recognition and measurement methods of the reportable segments correspond to
the consolidated recognition and measurement methods described in Note 6.3 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements.

_Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables_

The determination of the necessity and amount of valuation allowances on receivables requires assumptions and
estimates regarding the credit risk and underlying time intervals. In the case of a return debit, we inform the
customer and define a period for payment. When the defined time period has elapsed, written warnings are sent
to the customers. Further details are given in Notes 5.7 and 5.17 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

We use a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on
days past due and our historical default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on expectations as to the
collectability of the receivables.

_Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16_

The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering our debt structure and the useful life of
the leased assets. To measure lease liabilities, we use the incremental borrowing rate. We estimate the incremental
borrowing rate by using observable input factors.

_Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16_

The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably
certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering
the overall business development as well as the term of existing leases.

_Assumptions with regard to notes measurement including separation of embedded derivatives_

The embedded redemption option for the Existing Notes is considered to be not closely related to the host contract
according to IFRS 9, neither the option’s exercise price is equal to the carrying amount of the host contract on
each exercise date, nor the lender is reimbursed for an amount up to the present value of lost interest for the
remaining term of the host contract. Since both, the prepayment option and the interest rate floor relate to the
interest risk, both derivatives are treated as a single compound embedded derivative.

The methodology used to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives is based on the approach of a
Monte Carlo simulation. The refinancing rate is divided into a risk-free component and a credit risk component
in the form of a credit spread. The simulation of the risk-free rate is based on a Hull/White 1-factor model and the
simulation of the credit spread is based on a standard Wiener process. The optimal trade-off is determined on the
basis of the Longstaff/Schwartz approach. The starting point for the floor component is the simulated risk-free
interest rates. Based on the simulated interest rates, floorlets are formed for each individual quarter during the
term of the notes, which are then valued using the Black76 approach. The floorlet component is valued taking into
account any exercise of the call option during the simulation.

_Assumptions with regard to fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments_

The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Estimates of future floatingrate cash flows are based on quoted swap rates, futures prices and interbank borrowing rates. Estimated cash flows
are discounted using a yield curve constructed for hypothetical zero coupon bonds due on the date of each future
net settlement of the swap. The fair value estimate is subject to a credit risk adjustment that reflects our credit risk

98


-----

and the credit risk of the counterparty, this is calculated based on credit spreads derived from current credit default
swap or bond prices.

_Customer acquisition costs_

We issue vouchers in connection with the “friends recommend friends” program. For the fair value estimation of
the customer referral service, the group implements a portfolio-based derivation as an average value of the
commission payments actually made (i.e., taking into account the actual redemption rates of the vouchers). By
applying the portfolio approach, an estimated value is determined, that has been raised on the basis of a large
population. Due to the fact that management performs very detailed customer-related evaluations of the
consideration paid, it can be assumed that this is an appropriate consideration for the customer referral services
received.

We capitalize customer acquisition costs beginning on January 1, 2023, since a reasonable estimate of the fair
value of the referral fee was not possible before, for further details see Note 4.1 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements.

_Presentation of amounts related to supply chain financing_

We use reverse factoring to enable efficient payment processing of supplier invoices which result in derecognition
of the original trade payables as a debt-discharging payment is made by the financing partner to settle the
corresponding trade payables. As a discretionary management decision in respect of supply chain financing, the
liabilities covered by the reverse factoring program are considered to be a component of working capital and the
payments to the factoring service provider continue to be included in cash flows from operating activities because
they remain part of our normal operating cycle and their key character remains operational, i.e., indirect payments
for the purchase of goods and services. Payment terms under this program are modified to an extent customary in
the retail industry. The liabilities to the factor are recognized under other current financial liabilities (see Note
5.14. of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements), the interest expenses on the liabilities under
financial expenses (see Note 4.5. of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements).

_Factoring agreements_

We engage in factoring and regularly sell receivables to third parties. The contractual rights to receive the cashflow
of the financial assets are transferred to the factor. In accordance with IFRS 9, receivables are derecognized
because we lose control over the receivables. The derecognized receivables are no longer reported in our
consolidated statement of financial position.

**_Business combinations and goodwill_**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, we elect whether
to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

When we acquire a business, we assess the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at
the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the
amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each
of our cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets
or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. In case of any structural changes of the respective cashgenerating units within the Group, an impairment review and potential reallocation of the goodwill according to
IAS 36 is performed. More detailed information on impairment testing can be found in Note 5.1. of the 2023
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of March 31, 2024, our goodwill amounted to €203.5 million. No impairment was recognized in the three
months ended March 31, 2024.

99


-----

**_Fair value measurement_**

We apply measurement techniques that are appropriate under the respective circumstances and for which
sufficient data is available for fair value measurement. In the process, observable market inputs are to be preferred
to non-observable inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured or presented at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements are classified
on the basis of the following fair value hierarchy. The classification uses the input parameters of the lowest
category that is material to the fair value measurement.

  - Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

  - Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or
liabilities, either directly or indirectly

  - Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the assets and liabilities

**_Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recognized according to IFRS 15 at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods to customers, net of taxes and duties, and taking into
account agreed payment terms. Revenue is reported net of discounts, rebates, taxes and returns. Since we have
price discretion in our sales transactions and also bear the inventory and credit risk, we generally act as a principal
and are therefore the principal party of all sales transactions.

In addition, we purchase some products such as jewelry on a commission basis. In this case, we are acting as an
agent, but are free in the setting of prices. Moreover, we enable selected partners to sell goods directly to
BestSecret’s closed customer community over our Curated Platform. In both cases, revenue is earned in the
amount of the commission received. The amount remains immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2023 and
the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Revenue recognition requires the fulfillment of the following recognition criteria:

_Sale of goods and products_

Our contracts with customers for the sale of merchandise generally include a single performance obligation. We
have concluded that revenue from the sale of merchandise should be recognized at the point in time when control
of the asset is transferred to the customer. In the stationary retail business, revenue is therefore recognized upon
handing over the goods and in online trading upon delivery of the goods to the customer.

We enable selected partners to sell goods directly to BestSecret’s closed customer community over our Curated
Platform. The revenue is recognized in the amount of the commissions expected to be received from partners as
we act as agent.

_Accounting treatment of returns in the online business_

Under IFRS 15, the consideration received from the customer is variable because the contract allows the customer
to return the products. We use the expected value method to estimate the merchandise that will be returned because
this method predicts most accurately the amount of variable consideration to which we will be entitled. We apply
the requirements in IFRS 15 on constraining estimates of variable consideration such as return rate to determine
the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. We present a refund liability
(other current financial liabilities) and an asset (other current non-financial assets) for the right to recover
possession of goods from a customer separately in the statement of financial position, taking into account the costs
incurred for processing the return and the losses resulting from disposing of these goods. We present the expected
returns of goods on a gross basis in the statement of comprehensive income and reduce revenue by the full amount
of sales that we estimate to be returned. The dispatch of goods that is recorded in full when they are shipped is
then corrected by the estimated value of the returns. Generally, we allow goods to be returned within a period of
14 days of receipt. Longer periods may be agreed upon contractually.

100


-----

_Friends recommend friends – loyalty program_

We have implemented a recommendation program for customers. The first time the invitee (recommended
customer) places an order and does not return it in full, the inviting customer (inviter) receives a one-time voucher
of 10% to 20%. The inviter also receives a 5% to 7% voucher based on the total purchases of the invitee within a
period of 12 months. According to IFRS 15, both vouchers represent payments to the inviting customer under
IFRS 15 as costs to initiate a contract with a new customer (invitee). The purchase of the service is to be accounted
for in the same way as purchases from suppliers (IFRS 15.71). The customer referral service is to be measured at
fair value (or the lower transaction price). If the consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of
the customer referral service, the difference is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price. In the event that
the fair value of the customer referral service cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability, the entire
consideration payable to the customer is to be recognized as a reduction of revenue.

**_Taxes_**

_Current income taxes_

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the
tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

For the purpose of measuring current German taxes, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15% is applied to
distributed and retained earnings and a solidarity surcharge rate of 5.5% is applied to that amount. That yields a
tax rate of 15.83%. In addition, German trade tax is imposed on profits earned in Germany. The trade tax is based
on the assessment rates of the various municipalities and the basic federal rate, which has been a flat rate of 3.5%
according to Sec. 11 (2) GewStG (Gewerbesteuergesetz: German Trade Tax Act) since the corporate tax reform
in 2008. The trade tax varies depending on the different assessment rates of the municipalities, but a flat rate of
11.38% for the year ended December 31, 2023, 11.29% for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 11.41% for
the year ended December 31, 2021, is applied in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

The profits earned by the non-German Group companies are calculated on the basis of the national tax laws
applicable in each country and taxed at the tax rates in effect in those countries. The country-specific tax rates
range from 19 to 28%. Our tax rate is 27.21% for the year ended December 31, 2023 (27.12% for the year ended
December 31, 2022). Current tax expenses are calculated on the basis of the taxable income for the year. Taxable
income differs from the net income/profit presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a
result of the expenses and income that will not be taxable or that becomes tax-exempt in later years. Our liability
for current taxes is calculated on the basis of the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted in the near future.

_Deferred taxes_

Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:

  - Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

  - In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and
interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The initial recognition exemption to leases is not applied. IAS 12 amendments on deferred tax related to assets
and liabilities arising from a single transaction have no effect on the financial statement.

The Amendments to IAS 12 “International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules” with their publication on May
23, 2023, provide for a temporary exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes for the top-up tax, which are
in principle applicable retrospectively for the prior fiscal year as a result of the adoption by the EU on November
8, 2023. The Group is affected by the scope of the OECD rules on international minimum taxation (Pillar Two),
which are effective from January 1, 2024 and may increase income tax expenses in future. Tax effects that may

101


-----

result from the future application of the rules on global minimum taxation are not taken into account in determining
deferred taxes.

Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
utilized except:

  - Where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of
the transaction, affects neither the pre-tax accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

  - In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and
interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the
deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each
reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when
the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the end
of the reporting period.

Deferred income tax relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is recognized
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and not in the profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation
authority.

Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at
that date, are recognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment
is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the
measurement period or recognized in profit or loss.

As of March 31, 2024, deferred tax liabilities amounted to €56.5 million (compared to €61.0 million as of
December 31, 2023) and mainly belongs to the acquired intangible assets in connection with the purchase price
allocation (trademark and customer relationship) and the valuation of inventories. The deferred tax liabilities
decreased due to the amortization of the PPA assets.

_Value added tax_

Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of value added tax (“VAT”) except:

  - If VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case VAT is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as
applicable; and

  - Where receivables, payables and finance lease liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables
or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

**_Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired in the context of a business combination under IFRS 3 are recognized separately from
goodwill and measured at fair value at the acquisition date. This includes customer bases and brand names. These

102


-----

are recognized as an intangible asset according to IAS 38, measured at fair value and amortized over their expected
useful lives.

An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income
when the asset is derecognized.

Intangible assets which are not acquired as part of a business combination but as purchased licenses are initially
recognized at cost.

Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful life.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indications of
impairment at the reporting date. The remaining useful life and the amortization method for intangible assets with
a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of a reporting period. If the reasons for impairment have been
eliminated, a reversal to a maximum of the historical cost is set as the upper limit. Required changes in the
amortization period and method are treated as changes in estimates. Impairment losses on intangible assets, e.g.,
customer base and brand names, with finite useful lives are included in amortization within selling expenses.

As of March 31, 2024, other intangible assets (mainly customer relationships and trademarks) amounted to
€230.4 million.

**Total useful life in**

**years**

Purchased franchises, industrial and similar rights and assets as well as licenses
in such rights and assets ..................................................................................... 3-10

Own industrial rights and assets ......................................................................... 4

“Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base .................................................... 8

“BestSecret” customer base ................................................................................ 8

Customer acquisition costs ................................................................................. 7

The total useful life of the customer base Schustermann & Borenstein was reduced from 20 years to 14 years.
Reviewing the useful lives at the end of 2021 showed the need for prospective alignment of the remaining useful
life of the respective customer bases to 3 years from the 2022 reporting period onwards. This reduces the total
useful life for the Schustermann & Borenstein customer base accordingly to 8 years.

In the case of internally generated intangible assets, IAS 38 makes a distinction between the research phase and
the development phase. Costs incurred during the research phase cannot be capitalized; instead, they must be
recognized as an expense. On the other hand, costs incurred during the development phase must be capitalized,
_provided that the reporting entity demonstrably fulfills all six criteria set out in IAS 38.57 et seq. The Group_
primarily develops key components of software (Best Secret website and the Best Secret app as well as expenses
for the Group’s other IT-systems and infrastructure) used by the Group. A useful life of 4 to 5 years is assumed
for development activities in connection with the software.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost and depreciated in accordance with their expected useful life
using the straight-line method. The Group treats changes in the residual values or useful lives that arise during use
as a change in estimates. Depreciation is charged over the following useful lives

**Total useful life in**

**years**

Land, property rights and buildings including buildings on third-party land ..... 5-20

Own industrial rights and assets ......................................................................... 11-13

Other equipment ................................................................................................. 3-23

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of
comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.

103


-----

The residual values, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at
the end of each reporting period and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. If the carrying amount of a tangible
asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized, in addition to systematic depreciation, in
order to lower the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair
value less costs to sell (net selling price) and the present value of the net cash flows expected to result from the
continued use of the asset. Whenever possible, the net selling price is derived from the most recently observed
market transactions.

As of March 31, 2024, property, plant and equipment amounted to €100.1 million.

**_Inventories_**

Merchandise accounted for as inventories is recognized at cost pursuant to IAS 2. Cost is calculated on the basis
of an item-by-item measurement, factoring in the additions from the point of view of the sourcing market or on
the basis of the moving average price of the goods. Incidental acquisition costs are generally measured on a
monthly basis. Supplier payments that are to be classified as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of
inventories. Consumption of inventories is recognized within the costs of sales in the statement of comprehensive
income.

Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The net realizable
value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. Adequate write-downs to net realizable
value were made to allow for all risks from slow-moving goods and/or reduced salability. When the circumstances
that previously caused merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist, the write-down is reversed.
Our inventories as of December 31, 2021, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 were €232.9 million,
€263.7 million and €352.6 million, respectively, and €395.4 million as of March 31, 2024.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. The “Cash and cash equivalents” item in the
consolidated statement of financial position previously comprised cash, bank balances and credit balances with
payment service providers with a banking license (cash in transit). Credit balances with payment service providers
not holding a banking license are reported as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the consolidated statement of
financial position. The cash in transit balances are presented as cash equivalents as these balances are immediately
credited to the bank account with the payment service providers over which the company has direct power of
disposal.

For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the cash and cash equivalents defined above are presented less
overdraft facilities that have been drawn, as these are an integral part of the Group’s available cash.

**_Leases_**

_The Group as a lessee_

We lease various properties, equipment and vehicles. Leases are typically entered into for periods of 2 to 20 years.
Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The
lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing
purposes.

Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is
available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is broken down into an interest component and a principal
repayment. Interest is recognized in the consolidated income statement over the lease period so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for the reporting period (effective interest
method). It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or
rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value
guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination
option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease
term. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying
amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has
been reduced to zero.

104


-----

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include
the net present value of the following lease payments:

  - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable

  - lease payments covering renewal periods considered in the determination of the lease term

  - variable lease payments that are based on an index or an (interest) rate to the extent that a change in the
index or rate has actually triggered a change in the lease payments

  - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees

  - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and

  - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

  - the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability

  - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date

  - any initial direct costs, and

  - restoration costs.

Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are
recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.

_The Group as a lessor_

We sub-lease office and retail space.

When we act as a lessor, we determine at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.
To classify each lease, we make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks
and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if
not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, we consider certain indicators such as whether the
lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

In case of finance leases, rental income is recognized using the effective interest method over the term of the
subleases and reported under interest income. Payments received from operating subleases are recognized within
other operating income.

**_Financial instruments_**

Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial
assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when we become a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.

**_Financial assets_**

Financial assets (other than trade receivables without a significant financing component) are measured at fair
value on initial recognition plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The
fair values recognized in the balance sheet generally correspond to the market prices of the financial assets and
liabilities. If these are not directly available, they are calculated using recognized valuation models and current
market parameters. Trade receivables without a significant financing component are initially measured at
transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15.

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at: Amortized cost, fair value
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)–debt investment, FVOCI – equity investment or fair value through

105


-----

profit or loss (FVTPL). The Group assesses the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held
at portfolio level.

For the “held to collect” business model and the “held to collect and to sell” business model, the prerequisite is
that the cash flows of the financial instrument consist exclusively of interest payments and repayments (Solely
Payment of Principal and Interest–SPPI). Instruments that meet the SPPI test must be measured at amortized cost
in the “held to collect” business model and at FVOCI in the “held to collect and to sell” business model, subject
to the continued possibility of exercising the fair value option under certain conditions. Financial instruments that
do not pass the SPPI test must be classified and measured at FVTPL under the “Held for trading” business model.
No financial assets are allocated to the category “held to collect and sell” in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is usually the original invoice value less a
loss allowance for expected impairment losses. The loss allowance for trade receivables is determined based on
lifetime expected credit losses, which are calculated as the present value of expected cash shortfalls. Changes are
recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For its online
customers, we offer the option to purchase on account. In connection with this payment option, we work with a
factoring provider, transferring substantially all risks and rewards resulting from the receivables to the factoring
company and derecognizing receivables in the statement of financial position. Credit balances with Payment
Service Providers not holding a banking license are reported as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the consolidated
statement of financial position.

Within the Existing Notes, we identified an embedded derivative, which is recognized separately and measured
at fair value through profit or loss. The embedded redemption option for the note is considered to be not closely
related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. The redemption option and the interest rate floor of the host
contract are treated as a single compound embedded derivative, see Note 2.4.10 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Other financial assets are classified as “at amortized cost”, see Note 5.5 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely
repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount, are measured “at amortized cost”. A gain or loss on
such an instrument subsequently measured at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is sold
or impaired. Interest income from this type of financial asset is included in the consolidated income statement
using the effective interest rate method.

Credit risks related to debt instruments at amortized cost held by us at the reporting date are considered to be low.
Therefore, the regular approach in accordance with IFRS 9 requires us to determine, at inception as well as on an
ongoing basis during the lifetime of the debt instrument, the allowance as the credit losses expected in the next 12
months. If the credit risk were to increase and no longer be regarded as low-risk, lifetime expected credit losses
would have to be recognized. We consider credit risk as significantly increased if debt instruments are past due
for more than 30 days. For trade receivables, a separate approach is applied for measuring impairment, see Notes
5.7. and 5.17 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless we change our business model
for managing financial assets.

**_Financial liabilities_**

Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are
subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognized in the consolidated income statement over the duration of the obligation using the
effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial
liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate
that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and
received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or
discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount
upon initial recognition.

Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade and other payables and other liabilities, are measured
at amortized cost, see Notes 5.12 and 5.17 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Trade and
other payables are amounts owed as consideration for goods or services provided to us in the normal course of

106


-----

business including amounts owed to a payment service provider governing the settlement of supplier liabilities.
In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are therefore classified as current;
otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities, see Note 5.14 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while
non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest
method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or
nominal value.

We derecognize a financial liability when the related obligation has been paid, canceled, or has expired. The
difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized financial liability written off and the consideration
received or due is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

We use derivative financial instruments only for hedging purposes in order to reduce interest rate risks from the
Existing Notes. Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted separately as
derivatives, see Note 5.17 of the 2023 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet on the trade date and are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are generally
recognized in profit or loss or under certain criteria with no effect on income. Positive fair values lead to the
recognition of a financial asset, negative fair values to the recognition of a financial liability.

We apply cash flow hedges as of the reporting date.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair
value of the derivative is recognized in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of
changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognized in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair
value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion
of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

**_Provisions_**

Provisions are recognized in accordance with IAS 37 when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as
a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

A best estimate is made of the amount of the provisions, taking into consideration all the discernible risks arising
from the obligation. This refers to the amount that is most likely needed to settle the liability. Provisions with a
residual term of more than one year are discounted on the reporting date.

**_Share-based payment_**

Certain executives and executive management (managers) were given the opportunity to invest in different
German limited partnerships, which indirectly own interests of approximately 5% in the Group. The subscription
price for the partnership interests subscribed by the managers in the limited partnership corresponded to their fair
value at grant date.

The acquisition qualifies as a share-based payment under IFRS 2, and the managers’ interests in the limited
partnership are recognized as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement in the consolidated financial
statements. As the investments in the partnership were acquired at fair value, no expense is recognized as a result
of this transaction. The participation rights in form of partnership interests were acquired from an entity outside
the Group, and the Group has no obligation to make any payments on the partnership interests to the managers.
The share-based payment arrangements are fully vested at grant date. The sales constitute a performance vesting
condition that is considered a non-market performance condition. If the service condition is met, then the manager
can exercise his or her option at the market value per share. The investment program provides for various industrystandard cancellation and settlement events. There was no change in the year ended December 31, 2023.

**INDUSTRY**

**Markets**

We are a leading European premium and luxury destination for online off-price fashion with a distinctive business
model centered around our closed invitation-only membership model. We enable our brand partners to clear large
volumes of overstock with strong brand equity protection in a desirable environment. With a focus on international
premium and luxury brands, we provide our customers in 27 countries across Europe with a standing assortment
of premium and luxury brands at exclusive prices and a high-end user experience.

With a heritage of 100 years in the fashion industry, we have demonstrated an impressive growth trajectory and
evolved from an offline retailer to a fast-moving, tech-driven online platform comprised of both our traditional
wholesale business and our _Curated Platform marketplace business. We are the leading premium and luxury_
player in the online off-price segment and are the market leader in Germany, with an NMV-based market share
of approximately 15 to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Source: Market research by a leading
international strategy consultancy firm, 2024). We have also grown our platform outside of Germany to become
one of the leading players in Europe, achieving an NMV-based market share of approximately 4 to 6% for the
year ended December 31, 2023 (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy firm,
2024). We are ideally positioned to continue gaining market share, as we are one of the major platforms in a
market where “few winners take most” and the only off-price fashion player for members-only. Therefore, we
believe we have a superior proposition that enables us to win this space.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded revenue of €1,226.0 million, of which 60% was generated in
Germany and 40% was generated in our international markets. We are primarily an online platform, with online
revenue constituting 92% of our revenue, but we complement our offering with a select number of premium offline
stores, designed to promote our brand image and maximize the clearance rate of our inventory within our
ecosystem.

Our success is based on leveraging our deep and trusted relationships with our brand partners and customers. Our
unique business model, entrepreneurial focus, high-performing management team, and the continued expansion
of our operational and technological capabilities have enabled us to successfully embrace the structural shift in
the fashion industry to online and to continuously adapt to changing consumer behavior and brand partner needs.

**_Our Target Market Is Large and Has Attractive Growth Opportunities_**

The off-price fashion market exists as a result of overstock being a structural phenomenon in the fashion industry.
Most brands have highly complex and broad product assortments comprising several thousand stock keeping units
(SKUs) and the industry is witnessing a proliferation of SKUs, which is intensifying the complexity of
assortments. Therefore, it is very difficult to accurately forecast demand, particularly across every single product.
Long lead times, quickly changing fashion trends and unpredictable weather patterns are additional obstacles in
accurately forecasting demand, which can result in overstock when forecasts exceed actual sales.

Moreover, brands are incentivized to overproduce, as underproduction presents an economic disadvantage to
brands due to the high risk of missing sales targets and potential customer dissatisfaction, resulting in excess of
supply of off-price products. As a result, brands have a clear economic rationale to overproduce, as it is value
accretive and avoids erosion of customer satisfaction and brand loyalty relative to underproduction.

The following chart illustrates the economics of underproduction and overproduction for brands in a hypothetical
scenario:

108


-----

Furthermore, brands are moving away from their historical approach of destroying or exporting overstock given
their increased focus on ESG-related matters in order to maintain their positioning with stakeholders and also as
a compliance matter in connection with increasing ESG regulatory burdens. All these structural drivers translate
into a sell-through rate of between 75 and 80% for brands, meaning that between 20 and 25% of the stock they
produce eventually becomes overstock (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy
firm, 2024).

We operate in the massive online off-price fashion market, which is the fastest growing segment within the broader
off-price fashion sector. For example, in 2023, the total European mid-to-luxury fashion market (excluding the
U.K., Turkey, and Russia) had a size of €247 billion (based on NMV), of which €97 billion corresponds to the
total discounted fashion market (expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3% between 2023 and 2028, to
reach €114 billion in 2028). Within the total discounted fashion market, in 2023, the total off-price fashion market
had a size of €49 billion (expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6% between 2023 and 2028, to reach €64
billion in 2028). Within the total off-price fashion market, in 2023, the online market (in which we mainly operate)
had a size of €20 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 10% between 2023 and 2028, to
reach €31 billion in 2028 (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy firm, 2024).

The strong growth of our target market is driven by three decisive drivers:

_Mid-To-Luxury Market Growth_

The total European mid-to-luxury fashion market (excluding the U.K., Turkey, and Russia) is expected to keep
growing at a 3% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, reaching a market size of approximately
€293 billion and contributing approximately 3.5 percentage points to the growth of the European online off-price
mid-to-luxury fashion market (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy firm,
2024). This growth is expected to be driven by population growth and forecasted inflation compared to the zerointerest rate environment pre-COVID-19. The market is also expected to experience a slight shift towards
premium-to-luxury segments, as affluent customers are expected to persist in their spending habits in premium to
luxury. (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy firm, 2024).

_Off-Price Penetration Increase_

The penetration of off-price retail in the mid-to-luxury fashion market is expected to increase from 20% in 2023
to 22% in 2028, contributing approximately 2 percentage points to the growth of the European online off-price
mid-to-luxury fashion market, due to brands optimizing and devoting greater resources to their overstock
clearance strategy, allocating more in-season discounted stock to off-price channels, and an increasing share of
overstock, including luxury products, being placed into off-price channels as a consequence, among other reasons,
of brands’ ESG goals and upcoming EU regulation prohibiting destruction of unsold textiles. Furthermore, brands
are shifting more in-season discounted items to off-price channels, as their enhanced analytics allow them to make
earlier assessments of product performance with underperformers being then transferred into off-price channels

109


-----

rather than sold through full-price channels to better position such products for their sale. Moreover, as brands
increase their focus on more stringent cash management strategies, they increasingly favor the off-price market
as earlier in-season discounting at lower discount rates yields faster inventory turnover at superior margin levels
than end-of-season discounting. This aligns with the brands’ general strategy to limit discounted items in their
own channels in order to maintain price perception and protect brand equity.

_Online Off-Price Penetration Increase_

Online penetration in off-price is expected to increase from 41% as of 2023 to 49% in 2028 (Source: Market
research by a leading international strategy consultancy firm, 2024), contributing approximately 4 percentage
points to the growth of the European online off-price mid-to-luxury fashion market as brands increasingly leverage
online off-price fashion platforms due to their better scaling capabilities to clear the growing amount of overstock
as a result of the lack of stock limit constraints typically present in the physical or offline environment. Moreover,
for brand equity protection reasons, brands are hesitant to push their own online outlets (as there is limited distance
to full price). Brands are turning to third party online channels because they value the broader customer reach of
online models, as the majority of off-price shoppers start their journey online and consumers in general
increasingly prefer to shop online due to better stock availability and higher convenience related to offline
channels. At the same time, offline outlet expansion is stagnating due to a lack of available suitable space
combined with flat traffic and flat average spend per visit.

**Resilience through economic cycles**

Demand for off-price fashion has remained intact irrespective of economic cycles, proving that the off-price
market is very resilient in downturns, which has been demonstrated historically: since 2008, with the exception
of two years (2008 at the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis and 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic, when off-price retailers were significantly affected by store closures), off-price has consistently grown
at a double-digit rate, proving the strength of the secular trends driving market growth in the sector and that
demand for off-price fashion is more resilient to economic cycles than demand for full-price fashion. In a fashion
market boom consumers increase their fashion spend which also benefits the off-price market, whilst in downturn
periods, consumers shift from full-price to off-price given disposable incomes are pressured and brands produce
more overstock given poorer sell-through rate. In this regard, a survey carried out by a leading international
consultancy found that 47% of premium customers and 68% of luxury customers shop more in outlets in times of
economic crisis (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy firm, 2024).

While off-price fashion has consistently demonstrated resilience across different economic cycles, our outlook for
2024 is positive, as supported by advantageous supply and demand dynamics. Brand inventory levels have, on
average, remained above the 2019 averages and there is an upward trajectory in consumer sentiment, which is
fueling a continued increase in demand (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy
firm, 2024).

**Competition**

The competitive landscape of online off-price fashion platforms is experiencing an ongoing consolidation, as
brands are focusing on leading platforms when creating their off-price partner portfolio. In 2018, the top 5 offprice platforms accounted for 25 to 35% of the European online off-price market, whereas they accounted for 30
to 40% of the market in 2023. This trend is expected to continue, with the top 5 platforms expected to account for
35 to 45% of the market by 2028 (Source: Market research by a leading international strategy consultancy firm,
2024). There are several structural reasons for this ongoing consolidation trend: (1) better clearing capabilities, as
a larger and growing customer base can absorb larger stock volumes; (2) higher brand awareness, as customers
value a wide brand and product assortment and companies of larger scale can offer more attractive discounts and
(3) economies of scale, as higher stock pooling, better inventory management, and greater leverage on selling,
general, and administrative expenses facilitate economic efficiencies.

We offer our brands and customers a unique value proposition which distinctly sets us apart from competition and
makes us the online off-price preferred channel. From a brand perspective we are the only online off-price platform
to operate an invitation-only, closed membership model, fostering a high level of desirability and exclusivity, as
new members can only gain access through either a referral from an existing member or an invitation from us.
This unique approach provides our brand partners with a discreet environment, separate from their full price
channel, enabling them to clear overstock at scale with strong brand equity protection in a highly desirable
environment. On the customer side we offer constant access to appealing fashion merchandise. We deliver a
comprehensive offering that blends exclusive prices, a superior brand portfolio, and a sophisticated shopping

110


-----

environment, providing customers with a distinctive "reason to buy”. Our assortment consists of a diverse range
of brands at attractive discounts from 20-80% and the assortment is instantly shoppable throughout the year, unlike
many of our competitors that have a flash-sale model.

The competitors we face differ between our geographic markets as well as through different business models and
product offerings. In particular, we compete with other off-price fashion platforms, full-price platforms that offer
discounted in-season and end-of-season fashion, as well as platforms within the wider fashion e-commerce
landscape. Within the off-price fashion market, our competitors include T.K. Maxx, Lounge by Zalando, Veepee,
Yoox, among others. However, we believe that our business model and proposition is fundamentally different to
those of the aforementioned platforms as we are the only player with an exclusive invitation-only membership
model with a standing assortment, whereas they offer a discount for a short period of time on a limited number of
products. We believe that this flash-sale approach is less appealing to customers as they do not have access to a
permanent assortment of items and often face long delivery times. The competitive landscape within the
discounted in-season and end-of-season fashion segment is more fragmented and includes full-price platforms.

We are leading the attractive premium to luxury segment in online off-price in Europe thanks to our superior value
proposition providing strong brand equity protection, combined with a desirable shopping environment
(approximately 70% of our SKUs are premium or luxury). Our competitors are either focused on lower-priced
fashion segments (for example, Lounge by Zalando and Veepee) or are subscale (for example, Yoox). We focus
on the premium to luxury space as this is the segment with the highest share within the off-price fashion market
(57% as of 2023), the fastest growing segment (13% expected CAGR between 2023 and 2028 in luxury off-price
and 10% expected CAGR between 2023 and 2028 in the premium off-price segment, compared to 9% expected
CAGR between 2023 and 2028 in the mid-market off-price segment) (Source: Market research by a leading
international strategy consultancy firm, 2024).

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are one of Europe’s leading online destinations for premium and luxury off-price fashion. With a focus on
international premium and luxury brands, we offer our customers in 27 countries across Europe a standing
assortment of highly desirable fashion at exclusive prices in a premium shopping environment. At the same time,
we enable our brand partners to clear overstock at scale with minimum visibility and strong brand equity
protection. The success of our unique business model is based on its closed character with an invitation-only
customer membership, viral customer growth leading to unparalleled marketing efficiency, longstanding brand
partner and customer relationships, a tech-focused mindset, and its inherent contribution to more sustainability in
the fashion industry. We have a strong track record of profitable growth over many years. For the years ended
December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated revenue of €942.9
million, €1,051.0 million, €1,226.0 million and €1,290.6 million, respectively, an Adjusted EBITDA Before Run
Rate Cost Synergies of €138.7 million, €132.5 million, €165.8 million and €183.0 million, respectively, and an
Adjusted EBITDA Before Run Rate Cost Synergies Margin of 14.7%, 12.6%, 13.5% and 14.2%, respectively.
Our revenue and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA grew from €1,077.8 million and €143.6 million, respectively, in
the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 to €1,290.6 million and €200.9 million in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024, representing increases over 20% and 40%, respectively, over the same period. Our online revenue
accounted for 93.0%, 91.2%, 91.9% and 92.1% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022
and 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively (with a CAGR of 13.3% from the year ended
December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2023). While 59.0% of our revenue for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2024 (€762.0 million) was generated in Germany, our international business outside of Germany
continues to gain importance relative to our Germany business and experienced strong revenue growth from
€384.3 million (35.7% of revenue) in the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 to €528.5 million (41% of revenue)
in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, and from €267.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€489.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a CAGR of 35.2% over the same period.

**Strengths**

We believe that our business is characterized by a number of key strengths that set it apart from our competitors:

**_A European Leader in the Most Attractive, Resilient and Fastest Growing Fashion Segment_**

We focus on the fastest growing segment of the off-price fashion market, the online off-price fashion market, with
a European market size estimated at approximately €20 billion and projected to grow at a 10% CAGR through
2028, reaching approximately €31 billion (excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia). Additionally, we also
participate in the offline off-price market (which has a European market size estimated at approximately €29
billion excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia) through our four retail stores, two of which are located in Munich,
one in Vienna and one in Dresden. The total European off-price fashion market (comprised of the aforementioned
online and offline) has a size estimated at approximately €49 billion and is projected to grow at over a 6% CAGR
through 2028, reaching approximately €64 billion (excluding the U.K., Turkey and Russia). Expansion in the
online off-price sector is mainly driven by three decisive market growth levers: a) growth in the overall size of
the European mid-to-luxury fashion market, which is anticipated to increase from €247 billion in 2023 to €293
billion in 2028, b) the expected growth of the off-price share in the European mid-market-to-luxury fashion
market, with penetration expected to increase from 20% in 2023 to 22% in 2028, and, most importantly, c) the
online penetration growth in the European off-price fashion market, which is expected to grow from 41% in 2023
to 49% in 2028. In addition to its growth potential, the off-price fashion market is characterized by its resilience
to the economic cycles due to premium and luxury consumers’ continued interest in finding good deals in fashion
across all economic environments, coupled with the difficulty for brands to accurately predict demand and an
overall incentive to over-produce. As a result, while consumer spend tends to decrease in the overall fashion
market in the context of economic downturns, the off-price fashion market thrives in recessions due to the
consumer spend shift to lower purchase prices available in the off-price fashion market. On the other hand, during
periods of strong overall fashion market performance, the off-price fashion market still shows robust growth
supported by overall market buoyancy. The following table compares the growth development of the overall
European fashion market to that of the off-price fashion submarket across several market downturns:

We are a leading premium and luxury player in the European online off-price fashion market due to our strong
positioning in Germany as well as internationally. Furthermore, we are the only off-price fashion player with an
exclusive, invitation-only membership model. In 2021, our management decided to shift our strategy towards
accelerating our international growth in order to take advantage of the consolidation trend in the European online
off-price fashion market. This trend is illustrated by the growth in the share of the market captured by the top five
mid-to-luxury players, which has evolved from comprising 25% to 35% of the market in 2018 to comprising 30
to 40% of such market in 2023. This consolidation trend is still ongoing and is expected to continue evolving,
with a leading international strategy consultancy firm estimating that these players will capture 35% to 45% of
the market by 2028.

**_Superior Value Proposition Towards Brands and Customers, Resulting in a 100% Brand and a 100% NMV_**
**_Retention_**

Our success is based on our deep and long-standing relationships with our brand partners and our customers. We
continue to grow our business alongside our top brands, having achieved double-digit growth across our top brand
tiers and more than doubled the NMV of our top 50 brands from 2019 to 2023. During the same period, we have
also realized a brand relationship retention rate of almost 100%. This achievement is based on our strong value
proposition towards brands, which are able to clear overstock at scale in a desirable environment with strong brand
equity protection. This results from a combination of a) the exclusivity of our platform (we have a members-only,
invitation-only model and periodically sift out inactive members to keep an engaged customer base), b) our ability
to block display of our brands’ off-price offerings outside of the closed membership base (with no Google listings
and no crawling through external websites and almost 100% of our products being sold in our own ecosystem)
and c) our ability to block access to our platform by deal platforms and the use of invalid invitation codes (for
example, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we block over one million of such sessions per 100,000
non-member monthly website visits). Our good relationships with our brand partners mean we are the “first call”
for many of our brand partners, resulting in access to large volumes of attractive overstock. We continue to work
on making our product selection attractive and recently implemented our Elevation Strategy pursuant to which we
seek to advance our value proposition and focus on highly desirable brands, resulting in higher appeal for brand
partners (which in turn enables the acquisition of additional luxury brand partners) and customers, ultimately
delivering higher profitability for BestSecret. As a result of our strategy, our online NMV in the “highly desirable”
brand segment increased significantly between 2019 and 2023 as illustrated by the following table:

113

Source: BestSecret.

(1) Differences to the 100% total might occur due to rounding of figures. High desirability is assessed in terms of desirability and/or scale.
Desirability assessment is based on a popularity index including, among other parameters, Instagram follower and Google search count
for brand listings on premium to luxury platforms (such as Breuninger and Mytheresa), as well as on an internal assessment carried out
by Best Secret’s supply team. Scale assessment is based on total brand NMV in Europe. Private label not included.

Our customers find us attractive for a host of reasons encompassing, among others, our superior brand portfolio,
our high-end environment, and our exclusive prices, which in our view combines the best aspects of both off-price
and full-price fashion: while we have a leading position with respect to the assortment of luxury brands compared
to our off-price peers (source: market report from international leading strategy consultancy firm, 2024) and our
standing assortment is ten-fold that of flash sales players, we offer 20% to 80% discounts on our items,
representing an approximately 30% price advantage when compared against the prices of full-price retailers. At
the same time, we maintain a full-price alike onsite experience, delivery times and customer service. Our Elevation
Strategy and the continuous advancement of our value proposition and focus on highly desirable brands further
increase the appeal of our platform to our customers. The success of our strategies can be evidenced by our online
customer growth between 2019 and 2024, which grew at a CAGR of over 20% with an average CSR of over 2%
(excluding the 2021 average, in which marketing spend was intentionally increased beyond 2%). In terms of yearon-year growth, the total number of active customers in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 grew by 28%, 21%,
58%, 14% and 16% from the prior year, respectively.

**_Unique Viral Growth Engine, Resulting in Unparalleled Marketing Efficiency_**

At the heart of our highly successful and unique business model is our viral customer growth model. Active
customers invite friends and family members, who then register on our platform and eventually become active
customers upon carrying out their first order. This ensures exponential customer growth at a minimal cost. We
have also implemented a complementary paid growth model pursuant to which we invite non-viral customers via
direct, one-on-one marketing efforts. We leverage this paid customer acquisition model to accelerate our customer
growth by planting new customer “seeds” in underpenetrated regions in Germany and our international markets.
While we only opportunistically invested into paid growth before 2021, we now systematically use targeted
performance marketing to pursue international growth. Nevertheless, viral growth remains our principal source of
new customers. Viral customers have historically accounted for the vast majority of our new customers and
continue to do so, with approximately 76% of our new customers in 2023 being viral new customers, despite our
customer inflow having more than doubled since 2019. Furthermore, although customers tend to invite most
during their first year as a member, resulting in higher viral rates (defined as the number of new online viral
customers in the last twelve months divided by the average number of active online customers in the last twelve
months), for markets with a high share of new customers, our viral growth remains strong after the first year across
the markets in which we operate, including our core market, Germany, where we have a viral rate of 22% despite
the market’s higher maturity. In our International markets, we have a viral rate of 38%.

Consistent viral customer generation in turn ensures high LTV to CAC ratios, with LTV defined as cumulative
PCII (gross margin minus fulfillment costs, including payments and customer care) per online customer since first
order, and CAC defined as total marketing expenses divided by total number of new customers, resulting in

approximately 20% customer growth despite low marketing investment. The following graph reflects the
LTV/CAC ratio for the 2019 and 2023 period and demonstrates that we are able to maintain short payback periods
on our marketing costs with steadily increasing trends:

(1) Lifetime value.

(2) Customer acquisition cost.

We are generally able to maintain low marketing spend due to our viral model and in particular, our strong viral
growth dynamics, which resulted in an average NMV retention of almost 100% between 2019 and 2023, at a
limited cost and a marketing spend approximately four times lower than that of our full-price, e-commerce peers
(2.8% versus 10.9%). Furthermore, our marketing spend, although limited, creates significant ROI as from 2019
to 2023, for each euro we spent on marketing, we generated €5.5 of incremental revenue (compared to our fullprice, e-commerce peers, which generated €1.2 of average revenue per euro spent). This is primarily due to
approximately 76% of our customers being acquired through our viral model with our complementary paid
marketing model only ramping up in more recently penetrated markets and target segments.

**_Strong Growth Avenues to Continue our Consistent Double-Digit Growth_**

We have strong avenues to ensure sustained double-digit growth and ongoing value creation, as shown by our
results in the German market, where our online NMV has grown at a CAGR of 17.5% between 2019 and 2023,
from €364 million in 2019 to €695 million in 2023, and our increased international reach, as shown by our
international online NMV, which has grown at an CAGR of over 54% between 2019 and 2023, from €83 million
in 2019 to €468 million in 2023. Additionally, our increased focus on the luxury segment shows another path for
continued growth, with our luxury online NMV share approximately doubling between 2019 and 2023, from
around 2% in 2019 to around 4% in 2023. Operational enhancements, such as our new fulfillment center in Poland,
are set to decrease warehousing costs per item, contributing to reduced cost-to-serve and improved PCII margins.
Although our warehousing cost per item has slightly increased from €1.83 to €1.90 between 2019 and 2023, we
expect this cost to substantially decrease by 2027. Furthermore, our technology investments in AI and automation
are poised to transform core operations, enabling scalable growth with a lean team. Overall, our growth and value
creation is supported by the Elevation Strategy.

In 2021, our management shifted our strategy to accelerate our international growth and reach market leadership
across Europe. Our international growth strategy has three steps: (1) developing a relevant brand portfolio tailored
to local customer preferences, (2) localizing the customer experience by providing local language websites,
payment methods, carriers and customer care, improving shipment costs and investing in marketing, particularly
social media, to generate new customers and (3) scaling our customer base and revenues through predominately
viral growth. Our strategy has been instrumental in driving consistent double-digit expansion and delivering strong
internalization growth as illustrated by the below tables:

(1) International share of online NMV.

Furthermore, our luxury initiative, which centers on enriching our portfolio with highly desirable luxury brands
by forging direct relationships with these brands already shows promising results. We have a clear plan to continue
acquiring luxury brands, which encompasses, from a business-to-business (B2B) standpoint, the opening of two
offices in major luxury fashion capitals, Paris and Milan, the hiring of over 10 new luxury fashion and buying
experts and the launch of our Curated Platform in 2023 (which enables selected partners to sell goods directly to
BestSecret’s closed customer community) and, from a business-to-client (B2C) standpoint, the enhancing of our
customers’ user experience through the introduction of a dedicated luxury section on our platform and an overall
high-end shopping experience. These initiatives have translated into more than 20 leading luxury and designer
brands won since we launched our Elevation Strategy and over 55% of direct brand relationships being converted
within six months after the first meeting in 2023. Additionally, we recorded over 85% luxury NMV growth in the
second half of 2023 and our average luxury selling price (as compared to total average selling price) is more than
three times higher (based on the average from 2019 to 2023). This results in an increase of our luxury online NMV
share from around 2% in 2019 to around 4% in 2023.

Our business model supports our objective to grow within the luxury sector as luxury brands need support in
clearing overstock while protecting their brand equity. The luxury market is a large market segment, with the
affordable luxury and luxury market amounting to approximately €68 billion, compared to the off-price affordable
luxury and luxury market, amounting to approximately €10 billion and representing 15% off-price penetration
such luxury market. However, luxury brands need long-term support from off-price players as these brands: a)
experience continuous growth of their impaired inventory, b) the expansion of their own offline outlets is
stagnating and c) these brands are increasingly facing barriers to impaired inventory destruction (for example, the
EU ban on destruction of unsold product). In this environment, we are well-positioned to assist through our
superior value proposition, and by being one of the largest clearance partners available with significant scaling
potential.

With the aim of supporting our strong business growth, we have successfully transformed our warehousing
infrastructure over the past years. By expanding our German fulfillment center and adding a new fulfillment center
in Poland in 2023, we expanded our inventory capacity from 7.9 million items in 2019 to 16.2 million items in
2023. Our inventory capacity is expected to further grow to around 30 million items by 2027 as we gradually
increase the level of automation. We estimate that our future inventory capacity will be able to serve an additional
NMV of three billion. Furthermore, the fulfillment center in Poland in 2023 offers significant labor cost
advantages (60% cost advantage per hour versus the Germany fulfillment center) and we expect the increasing
automation in such fulfillment center to drive further cost improvements going forward.

**_We Have A Highly Resilient Financial Profile_**

We have a resilient financial profile marked by strong performance across economic cycles. Despite facing
challenges affecting the worldwide economy and overall fashion market, such as the global financial crisis and
the COVID-19 pandemic, we have nevertheless preserved a strong market position, consistently delivering
double-digit revenue and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA growth (at a CAGR of 21.0% between 2019 and 2023).
We also have a strong cash flow generation and reinvest our cash to seek further future growth, as illustrated by
our recurring cash conversion, which averaged 50.0% in the period between 2019 and 2023 and was 61.0% in the
year ended December 31, 2023. Furthermore, our senior secured net leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of total
principal amount of senior secured net financial debt to LTM Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA) reduced from 1.6x as
of March 31, 2023 to 0.9x as of March 31, 2024. Our financial solidity, combined with a cautious leverage strategy
and our continued investment in strategic growth initiatives, position us for continued profitable growth.

The following chart demonstrates our continuous double-digit revenue growth and double-digit profitability.

and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the Group for the periods indicated.

**Strategy**

To build on our existing success, we have identified the following key elements of our strategy:

**_Expanding our footprint_**

Our strategic growth ambition hinges on expanding our presence, both in our core market, Germany, and
internationally. Although our business is subject to higher penetration in certain areas of Germany, we continue
to see opportunity for revenue growth within this market, which is supported by our almost 100% NMV retention,
robust customer loyalty and strong inflow of new customers. Furthermore, we recognize vast opportunities for
further international expansion. Our strategic approach to acceleration of international growth involves three steps:
(1) developing access to a relevant brand portfolio tailored to local customer preferences, (2) localizing the
customer experience by providing local language websites, payment methods, carriers and customer care,
improving shipment costs and investing in marketing, particularly social media, to generate new customers and
(3) as a final step, scaling our customer base and revenues through predominately viral growth.

**_Elevating our value proposition_**

Complementing our growth ambitions in the German and the International segments, is our luxury initiative,
which centers on enriching our portfolio with highly desirable luxury brands by forging direct relationships with
these brands. The launch of our luxury initiative in 2023 has had significant early success. As of the year ended
December 31, 2023, and since the launch of our Elevation Strategy, we have managed to win more than 20 leading
luxury and designer brands and our luxury fashion NMV experienced period-on-period growth in excess of 180%
for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our luxury initiative is part of our overarching Elevation Strategy,

117


-----

which focuses on growing the share of highly desirable brands in our portfolio - both in the luxury and premium
segments. By winning new brands and by expanding our business with existing brands in these segments, we aim
to continue to make our assortment more appealing.

As part of our Elevation Strategy, we also enhanced our online presence by introducing a new high-end design
for our app and online shop and by adding a dedicated luxury section, thereby aligning more closely with the
appeal of luxury brands. We also established offices in the renowned fashion capitals of Paris and Milan,
underlining our commitment to expanding our ongoing international activities, and being closer to our
international brand partners. Our Elevation Strategy not only strengthens our relationships with highly desirable
premium and luxury suppliers, but also bolsters our appeal to our customers. By deepening customer relationships
through compelling offers, we continue to foster a strong community of loyal members. With our commitment to
enriching our product assortment, elevating our online platform, and refining our shopping and service
experiences, we promote the retention of existing and acquisition of new customers and pave a way forward in
the online off-price fashion market.

**Our History**

BestSecret draws on a heritage of 100 years in the textile industry. In 1924, Herman Schustermann founded a
textile company in Makredwitz, Germany and relocated to Munich in the late 1940s. In the early 1950s, Benno
Borenstein established his textile business in Munich. The two companies merged in 1960, and, after the death of
Herman Schustermann, a new cooperation was established with Herman’s son, Emil Schustermann, and Benno
Borenstein as partners. While Schustermann & Borenstein initially started as a combination of two textile trading
companies with regional customer bases around Munich, ready-to-wear clothes were added to the portfolio over
the next decades and the closed membership retail business model was born.

Prior to 2007, our business operations were limited to our Schustermann & Borenstein offline retail stores in
Munich. In 2007, we launched our BestSecret online platform. In 2011, we made the BestSecret online platform
available in the Austrian market, setting the first milestone for our international expansion strategy. Since then,
we have continued our online international expansion. Today, our multi-language online platform is available
across Europe with shipping available to 27 countries. We have continued to maintain a limited physical presence
with premium and outlet stores in strategic locations, with such locations designed primarily to support our online
platform.

In 2012, the BestSecret Group’s founding families sold a majority stake of 61% of the business to Ardian. In 2014,
construction commenced on the new centralized fulfillment center in Poing, Germany (near Munich), which
became operational in early 2016 and consolidated our then-existing seven warehouses. In 2014, we expanded
our offline retail footprint through the opening of a new store in Vienna, Austria. In 2016, we acquired Swiss
Online Shopping AG, a leading off-price player in Switzerland, to further expand our online presence in Germany,
Austria and Switzerland (hereafter referred to as the DACH region). In January 2017, funds owned and managed
by Permira acquired a majority stake in the Group. In 2019 and 2020, we expanded our fulfillment center in Poing,
Germany by approximately 60% to support our business growth.

In late 2020, Dr. Moritz Hahn joined us after nine years of experience at Zalando SE where he served as a member
of the Executive Committee and held numerous senior positions. He has since built a strong leadership team of ecommerce pioneers with decades of relevant experience across the tech and e-commerce industry, complemented
by senior individuals with long-term experience at and in-depth knowledge of the Company. In early 2021, this
senior leadership team announced a new strategy which is focused on online pure-play, profitable growth across
Europe. The offline strategy was sharpened to focus on supporting our online value proposition with premium
stores designed to elevate our brand image and outlet stores to clear inventory that fails to sell online. In 2021, the
structure and brand profile across the Group was simplified and harmonized, merging and renaming the companies
to solely feature the BestSecret name across the Group. In 2023, we launched our Elevation Strategy to grow the
share of highly desirable premium and luxury brands in our portfolio. We also enhanced our online presence by
introducing a new high-end design for our app and online shop and by adding a dedicated luxury section, thereby
aligning more closely with the appeal of luxury brands. In the same year, our new fulfillment center in Sulechów,
Poland, commenced its preliminary stage of operations. In 2024, we expanded our Sulechów fulfillment center
by 40,000 square meters to a total footprint of 120,000 square meters.

**Our Value Proposition**

Our business model offers a differentiated value proposition to brands and customers.

118


-----

**_Our Proposition to Brands_**

Our exclusive, invitation-only membership model enables brands to discreetly clear large volumes of overstock
in a high-end, desirable shopping environment entirely separate from their full-price channels. This protects their
brand equity, supports their sustainability goals and fosters our long-term and deep strategic partnerships.

Our value proposition to brands:

  - **Brand equity protection:** Through our invitation-only, closed membership model, information
regarding our brands and discounts is kept within the BestSecret online platform and is not made
externally available. With our unique closed membership online model, we provide brands the
opportunity to participate in the structural shift towards an online model with their off-price offering
while protecting their brand identity.

  - **Desirable environment: We focus on highly desirable brands to position brands next to peers on-site.**
Additionally, we provide a high-end shopping environment and access to an affluent and loyal customer
base.

  - **Clearance of large volumes: We support brands by clearing their overstock, thereby supporting their**
sustainability goals. Our stock-taking wholesale model (pursuant to which the inventory risk lies with
the Group) enables brands to efficiently and effectively clear overstock from their warehouses and,
combined with our pre-orders, creates revenue certainty. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—_
_Marketplace” and “—Operations—Supply—Commercial models.”_ Our Curated Platform (online
marketplace model) gives brands the option to keep control over their inventory and engage with the endcustomer directly, while still utilizing our valuable member base and closed platform to discreetly clear
overstock.

**_Our Proposition to Customers_**

We are committed to providing our customers with exclusive prices across a wide range of clothing, shoes and
accessories from desirable brands, while maintaining a high-end shopping environment through our online
platform that is on par with leading online full-price platforms. With our unique proposition, dedicated customer
service, comprehensive VIP Program (as defined below) and exclusive partnerships, we reward and care for our
customers and seek to transform them into loyal members of our community.

Our value proposition to customers:

  - **Exclusive prices: Within our exclusive platform that is only accessible for members (by invitation only),**
we provide attractive discounts ranging from 20% to 80% on the recommended retail price.

  - **Superior brand portfolio: With a focus on premium and luxury brands, we provided customers with**
access to a highly attractive fashion assortment.

  - **Highly desirable environment and best-in-class customer experience: We strive to ensure a high-end**
seamless shopping experience for our customers that is on par with leading online full-price platforms.
We provide a highly integrated, user-friendly online experience with our online platform and app,
multiple payment options, efficient and fast fulfillment, shipment to 27 countries across Europe, easy
returns and excellent customer service. An important feature of our customer experience is our standing
offering, with no flash-sale campaigns or extensive delivery times.

**Operations**

To enhance our partnership with brands, we are committed to being a reliable and professional off-price partner.
With respect to our customers, we strive to ensure that shopping for off-price fashion on our online platform is as
convenient and enjoyable as possible throughout their entire journey. Therefore, the operational activities forming
the backbone of our online platform consist of the following business activities (and corresponding departments):
Supply, Demand, Convenience, Retail, and Technology and Data Foundation, which are described in further detail
below.

119


-----

**_Supply_**

_Brands and merchandise_

Our ability to build long-term relationships with our brand partners is key to ensuring that we have first access to
their stock lists. We have been able to retain business relationships with all of our top 50 brand partners from 2019
(excluding private label suppliers). With a focus on premium and luxury brands, we offer merchandise from a
sizeable number of brands. This has contributed to the breadth of our product portfolio and ensures that we are
not dependent on any particular brand partner or fashion trend. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our largest
brand partner accounted for approximately 4% of total NMV and our top ten brand partners, together, accounted
for less than 25% of our total NMV.

Due to the scale of our platform, we are able to purchase large volumes from our brand partners. We have
significantly increased our purchasing budget in-line with the strong growth in our business. At the same time,
management believes that our brand partners are reducing their number of total online off-price partners, and as
the leading online off-price platform in Germany by revenue, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from
this market consolidation.

We actively manage our supplier base in order to continuously align with the assortment and volumes of
merchandise we require for our business. This enables us to maintain a fresh selection of merchandise year-round
– as of March 31, 2024, approximately 80% of our inventory value had been in stock for less than six months and
more than 95% for less than one year.

As part of our Elevation Strategy, we implemented sourcing initiatives that enable us to screen and add new brand
partners with a proven and systematic approach while allowing us to scale our biggest partners faster.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, by product category, our total NMV comprised 30%
Womenswear, 23% Menswear, 17% Shoes, 13% Accessories, 8% Sports, 6% Kids and 3% Home and Beauty.

Our buying strategy combines overstock with in-season and end-of-season orders, as well as pre-season collection
orders, to allow us to offer seasonally relevant merchandise and a permanent assortment to our customers while
providing additional revenue to our brand partners. We supplement our merchandise from our brand partners with
our private label merchandise. Our merchandising teams support our buying teams in driving sales and
profitability by managing inventory investments and driving efficiencies in the purchasing process.

_Commercial models_

Because our product assortment is permanent and does not follow the flash-sale model of other off-price platforms
(in which a discount or promotion is offered by the off-price platform for a short period of time), we are able to
provide a broad selection of items to our customers at any time. As a result, our brand partners can sell their
overstock to us on the spot, without having to wait for a flash-sale window. See—“Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to Our Business and Industry-We source the majority of our merchandise on the basis of purchase orders with_
_our brand partners, and the lack of formal supply agreements could impact our ability to maintain these_
_relationships.”_

Thereby, we offer to cash-buy stock from brands under a wholesale model through which we sell the purchased
inventory. Consistent with customary practice in our industry, our wholesale relationships with many of our brand
partners are not based on formalized supply agreements but, rather, the regular submission of purchase orders or
price agreements renegotiated periodically between the parties on order forms.

Alternatively, brands can sell via our platform themselves, using our marketplace model, _BestSecret Curated_
_Platform, which we introduced in the year ended December 31, 2022. Through our Curated Platform, we offer_
third-party fashion brands the option to market their products on their own terms without us acquiring these
products first. Our Curated Platform enables us to collaborate with affordable luxury and luxury brands, which
tend to prefer marketplace models that give them more control over merchandise presentation and prices.
Furthermore, our _Curated Platform has increased our profitability through commissions with attractive_
economics, while having limited inventory and working capital impact. The warehousing and fulfillment typically
remain in the hands of third-party suppliers. Alternatively, suppliers are able to rely on us for fulfillment at their
option, which allows us to benefit from incremental fulfillment fees on Curated Platform sales.

120


-----

**_Demand_**

Our double-digit revenue growth over many years is driven by a combination of an average 100% NMV retention
of existing active online customers, combined with a consistently strong online active customer growth.

_Highly Engaged Customers_

Our desirable products, prices and service attract a customer base that is active, loyal and highly engaged. Driven
by our broad offering and incentivized by our attractive loyalty scheme, our customer base keeps spending with
us year after year, leading to strong retention rates. This means that NMV by customer cohort, grouped by year
of first purchase, typically stays stable in the following years. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2019,
we retained 98% of the online NMV from the prior year’s active customer cohorts. Similarly, in the year ended
December 31, 2020, we retained 97% of the online NMV from the prior year’s active customer cohorts, with the
subsequent three years achieving 119%, 90% and 97% retention for the respective customer cohorts. Over time
and across cohorts, we have an average NMV retention of almost 100%.

_Viral Customer Growth_

The majority of our customer growth stems from our viral customer growth, which is growth as a result of existing
customers inviting new members. In the year ended December 31, 2023, 76% of new active online customers
were viral new customers. To push our viral growth, we utilize a customer experience toolset that allows us to
collect meaningful data for behavioral key drivers and helps us understand the dynamics behind our viral engine,
enabling us to further drive viral growth. Our viral engine is tied into our membership system granting customers
a limited number of invitation rights that can be shared with friends and family. New invitees become members
and get access to our assortment of products and also receive a limited number of invitation rights after their first
purchase. Our viral model leads to exponential customer growth, as shown by our average of over 20 active
customers in the year ended December 31, 2023, stemming from a single customer that became active in 2009 (a
measure derived from all non-viral customers joining in 2009, including customers without invitation, counting
LTM customers only).

_Paid Customer Acquisition_

Beginning in 2021, we started complementing our viral customer growth by utilizing paid marketing efforts
pursuant to which we invite new potential members to join our closed membership model via one-on-one
marketing on social media platforms. These new customers can then in turn make use of their invitation rights to
invite new members, thereby accelerating our viral engine. Targeted social media advertisements drive our
customer growth, especially in areas with lower penetration (such as Northern Germany and international
markets). This “seeding” strategy has been implemented with scaled marketing expenses, while maintaining short
payback periods. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—
_Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—New customer acquisition.”_

_Customer Loyalty Program_

Our customer loyalty program (which we refer to as the “VIP Program”) is designed to deepen our customer
relationships. The VIP Program includes three levels of status based on a point system: Silver (more than 300
points), Gold (more than 1,500 points) and Diamond (more than 2,500 points). Members collect points for each
online purchase, with each €1 spent (after returns) translating into one status point, as well as for recommending
new active customers and other activities (such as newsletter subscriptions or special sales events), which we
promote regularly. As of March 31, 2024, more than 70% of our customers have a VIP status. All Silver, Gold
and Diamond members receive vouchers for referrals of new active customers and receive a limited number of
invitations which they can extend to potential new customers. Depending on their status, our members receive
additional invitation vouchers, free priority shipping and sneak previews of new merchandise and benefit from an
extended free return period.

**_Convenience_**

_Content Management_

As an online fashion platform, our product content is key to helping our customers decide whether to order a
product or not, consequently driving sales and avoiding unwanted returns. Therefore, our content, both images
and text, needs to be accurate, inspiring yet realistic, complete yet relevant, and promote diversity to support our
ESG goals. Simultaneously, producing and/or onboarding of this content should be fast and cost-effective.

121


-----

Since we adopted our Elevation Strategy, we focus on continually enhancing our visual product content. For
example, we transitioned from virtual models to real models and increasingly incorporate brand images directly
from our brand partners. Luxury brands, in particular, prefer the use of their proprietary images on our platform
in order to tailor the presentation to their brand image. We outsource the creation of the majority of our content
to two specialized service providers that follow our content guidelines. Our internal team focuses on vendor
management, quality management and content innovations.

In addition to carefully crafting our visual content to guide and engage consumers, we also customize our product
selection to align with the unique preferences and tastes of each local market.

_Payments_

We offer different payment methods tailored to meet our members’ payment preferences, both in our stores and
online shop. These payment methods include credit cards, PayPal, direct debit, instant bank transfer and pay by
invoice. We believe that offering a wide array of payment methods enhances customer satisfaction and improves
our check-out conversion with respect to online sales.

_Logistics_

We operate two modern and large-scale fulfillment centers. One is located in Poing, near Munich, Germany, has
a footprint of 48,000 square meters and can hold approximately 10 million items of inventory.

In the year ended December 31, 2023, we launched a second fulfillment center in Sulechów, Poland. It has a
footprint of 120,000 square meters and is expected to nearly triple our existing storage capacity in Germany. Once
the center is fully ramped up over the next few years (including the development of automation capabilities), it is
expected to operate at a lower operating expense than our existing network.

Our logistics network also includes an externally operated returns processing center in Świebodzin, Poland, that
specializes in processing all returns; an externally operated Beauty and Bulk center in Slubice, Poland, that
specializes in the storage of bulky and beauty items, which commenced operations in June 2024; as well as two
smaller externally operated interim sites in Germany, until the Beauty and Bulk center is fully ramped up (expected
in the second half of 2024).

_Customer Care_

Our customer service team is available to help when a customer has a question or a problem. The customer service
team also strives to help us understand why our customers contact us in the first place and to ensure we address
the underlying root causes. We offer support through telephone, e-mail, and our self-help section on our website.
In addition to fast service with a high resolution rate for customer contacts, we focus on offering convenient
contact hours in our customers’ local language.

**_Retail_**

While we operate mostly online, our physical premium and outlet stores in Germany and Austria continue to be
an important part of our business model primarily to support and complement our online platform. In our premium
stores we offer a broad and attractive assortment of desirable brands in a high-quality environment, with products
typically arranged by key brands and presented, in some cases, in dedicated brand areas.

Our outlet stores serve as a sales channel for the overstock we are unable to sell profitably online, such as highreturn, single size or color articles and goods of second choice. This allows us to live up to our commitment to
conduct our business in an environmentally responsible and sustainable way by selling almost all of the
merchandise we receive from our brand partners within our ecosystem. Only items that are severely damaged and
cannot be worn anymore are not sold in our outlets, representing a negligible part of our stock.

Our offline retail store portfolio is comprised of four free-standing sites. Two sites are located in Munich,
Germany, one site is located in Dresden, Germany, and one site is located in Vienna, Austria. Most of our sites
are located on the periphery of the city center (i.e., off high street locations), which translates into higher sales
density, lower rent expenses and attractive cost-margin advantages.

**_Technology and Data Foundation_**

We are a technology and fashion company, continuously investing in the technology organization to support the
ongoing expansion of our online platform. Data is key to driving growth and, therefore, we have made substantial
investments to build a strong technology foundation that supports our future scale. Utilizing state-of-the-art, cloudbased data infrastructure, our key business data is easily accessible across all our business units to ensure faster,
more data-driven decision-making. Collaboration between data analysts, data scientists and data engineers further
ensures that the data we produce and analyze is put to its best use.

37% of our white-collar full-time employees, defined as non-warehouse or shop floor employees, work in our
three technology hubs in Germany, Spain and Greece as of March 31, 2024.

We aim to provide a user experience that aligns to that provided by leading full-price online platforms. We believe
we provide an exceptional experience on our apps with approximately 2.5 million downloads recorded in the year
ended December 31, 2023.

Over the course of the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had an
average number of 1,952 and 2,286 employees, respectively. We also use temporary employees, primarily in
connection with our logistics functions. The number of such employees fluctuates throughout the year and is
typically higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the period leading up to the holiday season.

We believe that our relationships with our employees are generally very positive. Although we have a few, nonmaterial, ongoing employment and labor disputes, we have not suffered any disruptions to our business as a result
of work stoppages or strikes in recent years.

In October 2022, in connection with the formation of Best Secret Group SE, a German SE works council (the “SE
**Works Council”) was established, which comprises 11 members and is responsible for cross-border matters and,**
so long as a national works council for such matters does not exist, national matters affecting employees in several
of the countries in which our Group operates. The participation agreement (Beteiligungsvereinbarung) concluded
in the context of the establishment of Best Secret Group SE does not provide for employee representation on
supervisory board level and accordingly, there is no employee representation in Best Secret Group SE. Except for
the SE Works Council, no employee representative bodies are established at any Group company.

Some of our subsidiaries are bound by collective bargaining agreements (Tarifverträge) or are members of an
employer association (Arbeitgeberverband). For example, Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH are
our only Group companies that are members of an employers’ association, the Handelsverband Bayern, but such
membership does not entail the application of collective bargaining agreements (OT Mitgliedschaft). Meanwhile,
industry-wide collective bargaining agreements apply in Austria, Italy and Spain and provide for typical

123


-----

employment terms and conditions such as remuneration, probationary period, notice periods, sick leave,
supplementary health insurance, annual vacation and termination periods. Additionally, due to mandatory
membership in the Austrian Chamber of Commerce (Wirtschaftskammer), Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH is
bound by two collective bargaining agreements for employees and apprentices in commercial operations
(Kollektivvertrag für Angestellte und Lehrlinge in Handelsbetrieben and Kollektivvertrag für Handelsarbeiter).
According to the German One-Third Participation Act (Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz), we may also be required to
implement a supervisory board with an employee representative at the levels of Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret
Logistik GmbH in the future.

**Intellectual Property**

As of March 31, 2024, we owned or had the right to use 42 trademarks (including German, EU, Chinese, and
Austrian trademarks) as well as related tradenames and logos. We also have a portfolio of 106 domain names,
notably for our BestSecret website. We believe that our trademarks and tradenames are of value to our business,
in particular as it pertains to our BestSecret trademark.

Additionally, in individual cases Best Secret GmbH enters into license agreements for word/figurative marks with
suppliers in relation to the non-exclusive distribution by Best Secret GmbH in its own name and for its own
account of certain products supplied by such suppliers and marketed under a certain brand. On January 1, 2023,
Best Secret GmbH has entered into a license agreement with supplier Bright Light Source Ltd for the German
word/figurative marks “HAMMERSTEIN MADE TO ORDER”, “Hammerstein Munich” and “Hammerstein”,
and the European trademark “Hammerstein 100% handstitched” in relation to the non-exclusive distribution by
Best Secret GmbH in its own name and for its own account of certain men’s shoes supplied by Bright Light Source
Ltd and marketed under the “Hammerstein” brand through its own sales outlets and through its webshop.

Finally, we, through Best Secret GmbH, have also entered into content production services agreements with Meero
SAS and Flixstock Pte. Ltd. in connection with the provision of digital content and services to Best Secret GmbH’s
digital platforms on June 30, 2021 and July 15, 2023, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements,
each party remains owner of any of its respective intellectual property rights included in its own existing
proprietary technologies, methods, or other existing intellectual property rights, while all new intellectual property
rights created by way of the production of content or the provision of services shall be owned by Best Secret
GmbH.

**Litigation**

We have been, and may from time to time be, party to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of our business such as employee claims and intellectual property disputes, among others.

We have one ongoing litigation proceeding. On October 11, 2023, logistics company NGL Naxos Global Logistics
GmbH (“NGL Naxos”) which used to provide various logistics services for our Group through Best Secret
Logistik GmbH since 2019 filed a claim in the district court (Landgericht) Munich I pursuant to which it requested
payment from Best Secret Logistik GmbH in the total amount of approximately €1,200,000.00 (plus interest) for
logistics services allegedly provided between May 2021 and December 2022. We, through Best Secret Logistik
GmbH, have requested a dismissal of this action on the basis that the underlying claims either have already been
settled, are based on a price that has not been contractually agreed upon between the parties or have been calculated
on an incorrect basis. The hearing for this matter is scheduled on November 22, 2024. We do not believe this
matter will result in an adverse outcome for our Group.

Additionally, since 2011, from time to time we enter into cease-and-desist agreements

(Unterlassungserklärungen) with certain suppliers in order to settle alleged claims, following customary market
practice in the retail industry. Under these agreements, our Group agrees to cease the advertisement or distribution
of certain products, as applicable.

We have not been within the past twelve months, and we are not currently a party to, any governmental, legal,
administrative, arbitration or dispute proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had, or is
expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance against various risks related to the ordinary operations of our business, including general
business interruption insurance and third-party liability, property damage, electronic damage, transportation
damage and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance as well as cyber-security insurance. We conduct periodic

124


-----

reviews of our insurance coverage, both in terms of coverage limits and deductibles. We believe that the types
and amounts of insurance coverage that we maintain are consistent with customary industry standards. However,
no assurances can be given that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the cost of defense or damages in the
event of a significant claim.

**Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Matters**

According to TheRoundup.org, 87% of all textiles in the fashion industry end up on landfills, comprising 7% of
all waste in global landfill space (source: TheRoundup.org, 17 Most Worrying Textile Waste Statistics & Facts).
We believe our business model provides one of the most sustainable ways to shop for fashion. By focusing on
overstock clearance, we help ensure that nearly every piece of fashion that is fit-to-wear finds an owner, thereby
reducing the amount of fashion that is discarded as waste. In the year ended December 31, 2023, 76% of our total
intake was overstock merchandise. We give fashion its first life, just as second-hand retailers provide products
with a second life.

We support and complement our online platform with our physical premium and outlet stores in Germany and
Austria, which allow us to clear the overstock we are unable to sell profitably online anymore, such as high-return,
single size or color articles and goods of second choice.

We are working to ensure compliance with the growing body of regulations governing ESG matters and further
increase sustainability in what we sell and how we sell through our own Sustainability Program. As part of this
program, we strive to create a positive environmental and social impact and minimize negative impacts in this
regard. We also aim for our Sustainability Program to establish clear initiatives and transparent criteria against
which we measure our progress.

For example, in 2023, as a part of our sustainability initiatives and in an effort to reduce the number of discarded
fashion items, we expanded our online product take-back program by 50%, launched a pre-loved second-hand
product category and maintained the share of articles in our stock that could not be sold in our ecosystem at 1%.
Our targets for 2024 and the future include expanding our pre-loved product offering, as well as continuing our
product take-back programs.

Additionally, in 2023, in relation to improving the sustainability of our supply, we developed a sustainable
sourcing guide for textiles, conducted a workshop for buyers to train them on climate-friendly and sustainable
sourcing practices and increased the share of sustainable materials in our women’s fashion apparel line. Our goals
for the future include ensuring continued compliance with various ESG laws and regulations.

Further, as part of our commitment to ESG, we publish a sustainability report on an annual basis.

**_Our Governance and Management_**

We have created a governance structure to promote responsibility and accountability for ESG matters across the
Company. Furthermore, we have also implemented a meeting and alignment structure that we believe will allow
us to progress in our ESG efforts through regular alignments and meetings.

**Real Estate and Leases**

We do not own any real estate. Our corporate headquarters, logistics and office space and all of our stores are
leased pursuant to commercial lease agreements.

We lease properties in 20 locations throughout seven countries. Our leased properties are mainly located in
Germany, where these properties include office, fulfillment and parking spaces, retail units, our headquarters and
a fulfillment center. Our leased properties in other jurisdictions include a fulfillment center in Poland, office space
in France, Spain, Greece and Italy, and a retail unit in Austria. Lease agreements for our leased properties are
generally long-term leases with an initial fixed term of up to 10 years and the option to extend the lease on one or
more occasions for an additional period of up to five years. The lease agreements are entered into by different
Group companies depending on their purpose. For example, the lease agreement for our fulfillment center in
Poing, Germany, was entered into by Best Secret Logistik GmbH, the lease agreement for our fulfillment center
in Sulechów, Poland was entered into by Best Secret Poland sp. z.o.o, the lease agreement for our office space in
Milan, Italy was entered into by Best Secret S.r.l., our lease agreements for our office spaces in Granada, Spain
and Paris, France were entered into by Best Secret GmbH and the lease agreement for our offline store in Vienna,
Austria was entered into by Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH. A number of our lease agreements provide for the
right to sublet the leased premises with the prior consent of the lessor. As it pertains to our offline stores, our lease

125


-----

agreement for our premises in Munich expires in 2027 with the agreement providing for two unilateral extension
options by five years each. Our lease agreements for our Dornach premises expire in 2025 (premium store) and
2027 (outlet store), respectively. Our lease agreement for our site in Vienna has an indefinite term, subject to a 6month notice termination option first exercisable on December 31, 2024. Our lease agreement for our site in
Dresden expires in 2028. In addition, we have a lease agreement for our former Frankfurt site, which we are
seeking to terminate.

In September 2013, we entered into a lease agreement relating to our fulfillment center in Poing, Germany, which
includes two warehouses, with a fixed initial term until November 30, 2025 and November 30, 2030, respectively.
The lease agreement also includes options to extend the contract as it pertains to both warehouses in five year
increments until 2040. In addition, in June 2016, we entered into an amendment agreement in relation to the
existing lease agreement regarding our lease at Margaretha-Ley-Ring 10 and 27 in Aschheim-Dornach, where our
corporate headquarters are located, which will expire in 2027. Most of our lease agreements for retail space in
Germany are with entities controlled by the Schustermann and Borenstein families, and the limited partners of the
lessor under the lease agreement relating to the Poing facility also include certain individuals from the
Schustermann and Borenstein families. For more information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions”._

In May 2022, we entered into a lease agreement relating to our new fulfillment center in Sulechów, Poland. The
new fulfillment center entered operation in the year ended December 31, 2023 and is larger than our current main
fulfillment center in Poing, Germany.

On October 5, 2023, Best Secret Group SE entered into a lease contract for an office in Munich, Germany in order
to provide a space for further employee interaction and entrepreneurial growth. We expect the office space to be
completed by the end of the second half of 2024.

In general, the amount of rent payable under our lease agreements is fixed upon the signing of the relevant lease
agreement. Certain of our lease agreements provide for rent adjustments based on consumer price indices or
provide for step ups of rent amounts every several years.

**Regulatory Environment**

We operate in several countries and our business is subject to various regulatory requirements under the laws of
the European Union (“EU”) and national laws in relevant countries. Laws and regulations applicable to our
operations may differ due to different national and local laws. Applicable regulatory requirements relate, in
particular, to our dealing with customers, consumer protection, and the processing of customer data.

By creating a common regulatory framework for the member states of the European Union (“EU Member
**States”), EU law reached a considerable degree of regulatory harmonization in several areas relevant for our**
business. EU law comprises both directives as well as regulations. While the latter apply directly in all EU Member
States, EU directives need to be transposed into national law in each EU Member State. Therefore, standards
contained in EU directives may slightly differ from one EU Member State to another depending on the actual
implementation into national law.

The following section provides a brief overview of selected EU and German legislation and regulations which are
applicable to our business. Similar laws and regulations also apply to our business in other jurisdictions in which
we operate.

**_Data Protection_**

The processing of personal data within the EU and the EEA is primarily governed by the General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, “GDPR”) which became effective on May 25, 2018.
The GDPR applies to any enterprise that is processing the personal data of individuals (data subjects) within the
EU/EEA regardless of its location and the data subjects’ citizenship or residence. It is also applicable where the
processing activities are related to (1) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the
data subject is required, to such data subjects in the EU/EEA, or (2) the monitoring of data subject’s behavior as
far as their behavior takes place within the EU/EEA. The GDPR aims primarily to protect fundamental rights and
freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data and to harmonize the
EU regulatory framework of data protection.

Under the GDPR, personal data may only be processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and only if
the processing is covered by a legal basis (e.g., consent of the data subject, if it is necessary for the performance

126


-----

of a contract, to comply with a legal obligation, or if we rely on our overriding legitimate interests). Furthermore,
data subjects must be informed transparently before the processing of personal data about the circumstances of
the intended processing activities (e.g., purposes, retention periods, recipients of the personal data). This aims to
enable the data subjects to effectively exercise their rights under the GDPR (e.g., the right of access to or the right
to erasure of their personal data, if the relevant requirements are met). Furthermore, the GDPR provides restrictive
requirements as regards solely automated decision making and profiling activities, which could for example
impact marketing activities based on such processing of personal data.

The GDPR also stipulates that certain technical and organizational measures must be implemented to protect
personal data depending on the amount of and potential risk for the personal data processed. These measures may
include physical security against unauthorized access and manipulation, password security, reasonable encryption
as well as protection against accidental data loss, destruction, or damage. Based on the general accountability
principle of the GDPR, the processing activities and the corresponding data protection measures must be
sufficiently documented (such as keeping records of processing activities). Furthermore, under the GDPR, special
care and safeguards must also be taken when transferring personal data to countries outside the EEA to ensure
that a level of data protection equivalent to the EU is in place for the processing of personal data. Recent legal
developments in the EU, e.g., the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) of July 16, 2020
(case no C-311/18, Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems, socalled “Schrems II”) and the July 10, 2023, European Commission adequacy decision for the EU-US Data
Privacy Framework (“DPF”), have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such data transfers.

The GDPR provides for fines of up to €20.0 million or 4% of global turnover on a group basis, whichever is
greater and depending on the respective breach for non-compliance with GDPR provisions. Failure to comply
with the GDPR can also result in claims for compensation for financial or non-financial damages claimed by
individuals under Article 82 GDPR and cease and desist claims. Non-compliance may further result in
proceedings or actions against us by governmental authorities, including corresponding costs for litigation, or
require us to change our operations and/or cease or modify our use of certain personal data sets. We may also be
contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of
non-compliance with data protection requirements. Individual EU Member States, like Germany, also provide
criminal sanctions for specific severe violations. Finally, in addition to these regulatory risks, infringement of the
GDPR can lead to reputational risk and significantly undermine customers’ trust in our business.

In the event of a breach of the protection of personal data, we are required to submit data breach notifications to
the relevant local data protection authorities (“DPAs”) within 72 hours beginning with the awareness of a possible
breach. If the breach concerned entails a high risk to the rights of the data subjects, they also need to be informed.
Data subjects, DPAs and competitors, as well as consumer associations, and other authorized associations may
pursue claims, including potentially mass litigation, against us for breach of the GDPR.

We are subject to the supervision of the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (Bayerisches
_Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht). To comply with regulatory requirements imposed on us, we have, inter alia,_
established a data protection organization as well as data protection processes, including, without limitation,
appointing data protection officers, where required, and have implemented data protection policies for all
employees dealing with personal data. However, the task of meeting all the data protection law requirements is
complex, in particular taking into account that there are still material legal uncertainties in various respects and
that data protection authorities continuously publish more detailed GDPR guidance.

In addition to the GDPR, the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, “BDSG”) applies
to the processing of personal data within Germany. The BDSG provides further data protection rules by making
use of derogation and opening clauses in the GDPR. It stipulates, inter alia, additional requirements to limitations
on the scope of data subjects’ rights and personal data processing in the employment context. Other EU Member
States implemented similar local data protection acts.

Furthermore, based on its data strategy, the European Union further revised the legal framework for the handling
data, for example through the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. Due to the novelty of the
regulations, there are still uncertainties as to its interpretation and implementation. Hence, we may not always
fully comply with the requirements of the Digital Services Act as interpreted by competent authorities and/courts.

**_Digital Services Law_**

Our business activities are also subject to the German Telecommunication and Digital Service Data Protection
Act (Telekommunikation-Digitale-Dienste-Datenschutz-Gesetz, “TDDDG”), which only recently replaced the

127


-----

former German Telecommunication and Telemedia Data Protection Act (Telekommunikation-Telemedien_Datenschutz-Gesetz). To the extent the TDDDG transposes the provisions of EU Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy_
and electronic communications (“ePrivacy Directive”), it prevails over the GDPR.

The TDDDG provides special data protection rules and also stipulates provisions on the use of cookies and similar
technologies, regardless of whether the data is personal data or not. Generally, the end user must actively consent
to the use of cookies and similar technologies on the basis of clear and comprehensive information, except for
cookies and similar technologies that are technically strictly essential for a service requested by the end user and
for cookies and similar technologies that are used exclusively for the transmission of messages via a public
telecommunications network. This is also in line with recent case law by the European Court of Justice and the
German Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof), which have both specified the requirements on the use of cookies.
These provisions and rulings are relevant for our online business and the use of web tracking tools, each of which
relies on cookies and similar technologies, and must be taken into account by all website operators.

In addition, the TDDDG stipulates that we as a digital service provider must implement certain technical and
organizational measures in order to protect our customers’ data and our IT systems (e.g., protection against
unauthorized access and (technical) interference).

The Digital Services Act (Digitale-Dienste-Gesetz, “DDG”), which only recently replaced the former Telemedia
Act (Telemediengesetz), remains relevant to the extent information requirements are not superseded by either the
GDPR or the TDDDG. The DDG requires digital service providers to provide certain information on their website,
such as name and address and contact details (Section 5 DDG).

Non-compliance with the provisions on cookies and similar technologies under the TDDDG may result in
monetary fines of up to €300,000.

Moreover, the requirements for the use of cookies and similar technologies are constantly evolving. For example,
there is a draft Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (“ePrivacy Regulation”) that would replace
the current ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws, such as German implementation laws in the
TDDDG. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, data protection authorities’ recent
guidance is driving increased attention to cookies and similar technologies.

**_Consumer Protection Laws_**

We are affected by consumer protection laws that apply to businesses generally and, in particular, to businesses
that operate on the internet. At the EU level, consumer protection is comprehensively regulated by various
directives, inter alia:

  - Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2019, on certain
aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods (“EU **Sales of Goods Directive”);**

  - Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2011, as amended,
on consumer rights;

  - Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 11, 2005, as amended,
concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market;

  - Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2000, on certain legal
aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market
(“eCommerce Directive”);

  - Council Directive 93/13/EEC of April 5, 1993, as amended, on unfair terms in consumer contracts; and

  - Directive 98/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 16, 1998, as amended, on
consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to customers.

With Directive (EU) 2019/2161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 27, 2019, as regards
the better enforcement and modernization of Union consumer protection rules, the EU amended the existing EU
instruments for strengthened consumer protection. EU Member States had to transpose the new rules in their
national laws by November 28, 2021, and must apply these new national laws since May 28, 2022.

128


-----

In Germany, for example, we are therefore subject to various laws concerning the protection of consumers, which
have been primarily laid down in the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch). Pursuant to these laws, we
are responsible for the conformity of the shipped products with the agreed or implied quality at the time the
purchase is made. And a consumer has certain statutory warranty rights (irrespective of our fault) should a product
be defective at the time of delivery. If a product is defective, consumers may generally require the retailer to repair
or replace the product in question free of charge.

The German Civil Code also regulates distance selling contracts (Fernabsatzverträge) to protect consumer
interests. The consumer benefits, among other things, from a statutory right of withdrawal from a distance selling
contract within a period of 14 days after the consumer has received the respective goods and has been informed
about his right of withdrawal in a manner compliant with the statutory requirements. During this time, a purchase
may be cancelled without any specific reason. If the consumer has not been properly informed about his/her
statutory right of withdrawal, the respective right expires twelve months and 14 days after receipt of the goods. If
customers exercise their right of withdrawal, they must return the goods and the retailer must refund the purchase
price, including any shipping costs originally charged. However, the retailer is not obliged to reimburse consumers
for any additional costs if the consumer has expressly opted for a more expensive type of delivery (e.g., express
delivery). On the other hand, the consumer must usually bear the costs of returning the goods, unless the retailer
failed to inform him or her accordingly or the retailer has expressly agreed to bear these costs. The consumer also
has to compensate the retailer for any loss in value of the returned goods in case such loss is due to the consumer’s
handling of the goods in a way that was not necessary to examine its condition, features and functionalities of the
product and the retailer has informed the consumer accordingly.

With the substantial 2022 reform of German contract law (Schuldrechtsreform 2022), the German legislator has
introduced further consumer-friendly regulations based on the EU Sales of Goods Directive, e.g., the reversal of
the burden of proof regarding the defectiveness of the purchased item at the time of handover at the expense of
the retailer extended from six months to one year. The introduced amendments to the German Civil Code entered
into force on January 1, 2022.

The German Civil Code, in connection with the Introductory Law to the German Civil Code (Einführungsgesetz
_zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch), also stipulates that certain mandatory information must be provided to the_
consumer, including material characteristics of the purchased goods, the identity of the seller, terms of payment,
delivery and/or service, price and payment details and the statutory right of withdrawal.

In addition, in accordance with the German Price Indication Regulation (Preisangabenverordnung), retailers must
ensure, among other things, that the price of each product is displayed clearly, precisely and legibly and shall be
accessible, legible and intelligible on websites.

Against the backdrop of Directive (EU) 2019/2161 as regards the better enforcement and modernization of Union
consumer protection rules, the German Price Indication Regulation has been amended to include, as of May 28,
2022, new regulations for the announcement of price reductions for goods. The overall aim is to make the original
price on which a price reduction is based more transparent to the consumer. To this effect, each announcement of
a price reduction also has to state the lowest price applied by the retailer within a period of 30 days prior to the
application of the price reduction. The aim is also to put a stop to short-term price increases in advance of price
reductions. Infringements of the Price Indication Obligation may constitute administrative offenses that can be
sanctioned with an administrative fine (Bußgeld) of up to €25,000. Price comparisons, including the comparison
of actual price versus the recommended retail price as we carry them out, do not fall under the scope of the
directive.

We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to unfair competition in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
In particular, in Germany, competitors, consumer associations (Verbraucherverbände) and other authorized
associations may seek to enforce alleged violations of, or the failure to comply with, the Act Against Unfair
Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb). Based on the Act Against Unfair Competition, unfair
commercial practices are illegal. Unfair commercial practices include, inter alia, commercial practices which are
misleading (including untrue information as to the existence of a special price advantage, the price or the manner
in which it is calculated), which constitute an unreasonable nuisance, which make use of harassment, coercion, or
undue influence, as well as unsolicited marketing (including unsolicited e-mail marketing).

Additionally, we must comply with information requirements relating to the European Online Dispute Resolution
(“ODR”) platform for consumers. On January 9, 2016, Regulation (EU) 524/2013 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of May 21, 2013, on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes (“ODR Regulation”)
entered into force. It requires online retailers to disclose certain information on their websites to ensure that

129


-----

consumers are aware of the new ODR possibilities. Another information requirement is set up by Directive
2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 21, 2013, on alternative dispute resolution for
consumer disputes (“ADR-Directive”). In Germany, for instance, the implementation act, the Consumer Dispute
Resolution Act (Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetz) generally obliges online retailers to inform their customers
to what extent they are willing or obliged to participate in alternative dispute resolution procedures. Anyone who
has undertaken or is obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings must provide information on the
address and website of the competent alternative dispute resolution body.

**_Foreign Trade and Customs Law_**

We source many of our products within the European Union. Within the European internal market, the principle
of free movement of goods, as stipulated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, applies. With
respect to import and export of goods from countries which are not members of the EU, we must comply with
national and European foreign trade and customs regulations. At the EU level our relevant regulatory framework
is based on the Union Customs Code (Regulation (EU) 952/2013). In Germany, the Foreign Trade and Payments
Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz) and the Ordinance on the Foreign Trade and Payments Act

(Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) constitute additional regulations which, _inter alia, set forth rules of procedure._
Infringements of customs or foreign trade regulations may be sanctioned with an administrative fine (Bußgeld) if
categorized as administrative offenses or with a fine (Geldstrafe) or custodial sentence (Freiheitsstrafe) if
categorized as criminal acts. Depending on the extent and nature of the underlying administrative offense, the
respective fine may amount to up to €30,000 for violations of procedural regulations and up to €500,000 for
violations of other regulations of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act and even higher in certain administrative
offenses. Even higher fines are possible in case of skimming of profits (Gewinnabschöpfung). The authorities may
from time to time undertake external audits (Außenwirtschaftsprüfung) to assess whether we have complied with
the regulations of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act and the pertaining ordinances.

Whereas imports and exports within the EEA are in principle not liable to customs duty, the movement of goods
beyond the frontiers of the EEA may be subject to customs. The customs control charges, _inter alia, statutory_
import duties (Einfuhrabgaben). Customs offices may, from time to time initiate customs inspections
(Zollprüfung) to assess whether customs regulations have been infringed.

The countries belonging to the EEA may charge customs duties if products are exported into such non-EEA
countries. We also distribute our products in Switzerland (which does not belong to the EEA). Switzerland,
however, is party to a preferential agreement (Präferenzabkommen), such agreements being concluded with the
European Union and certain other countries in order to facilitate the exchange of goods. The rate of customs duty
for goods exported into countries which are parties to the preferential agreement is considerably lower than the
regular customs duty rate. The customs administration assesses in a preference inspection (Präferenzprüfung) in
accordance with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447, as amended, which applies from
May 1, 2016, whether the requirements and conditions set forth in the preferential agreement are complied with.

Following the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, businesses involving Russia and Belarus as
well as regions of the Ukraine are subject to statutory sanctions (including Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014
of 31 July 2014, Council Regulation (EC) No 765/2006 of 18 May 2006 and Council Regulation (EU) No
269/2014 of 17 March 2014). We continuously assess the impact of changes in the geopolitical situation of our
business and take steps to ensure compliance with developing sanctions and export controls. We are further
required to comply with financial and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, sectoral sanctions (which, for
example, target certain sectors of the Russian economy) and list-based sanctions against certain entities and
individuals, including persons identified on the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control
(“OFAC”) List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”). As a general matter,
US sanctions prohibit only US persons from transacting or dealing with parties on the SDN List, absent OFAC
authorization. The obligation to screen US sanctions lists may follow from contracts with suppliers, credit
facilities, or loan agreements that require compliance with US sanctions or screening against US sanctions lists.

**_Product Liability and Textile Labeling Law_**

In Germany, in addition to the general liability under civil law, we are in general subject to liability under the
Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) which is based on Council Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985,
on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the EU Member States concerning
liability for defective products. Under this act, we are liable, regardless of fault, for damage to life, body, health
and property caused by defective products to the extent we qualify as the “manufacturer” under the Product
Liability Act. This may be the case if we actually manufacture the products but also if we place our own logo or

130


-----

name on the products or if we import the products into the EEA. The producer`s liability is limited to an amount
of €85 million. In case of any damage to property, the injured party has to pay for damages up to an amount of
€500.

Furthermore, although there is no coherent legal framework for trade in textiles in Germany, certain laws and
regulations may apply to us. For example, the German Food, Consumer Goods and Feed Act (Lebensmittel-,
_Bedarfsgegenstände- und Futtermittelgesetzbuch) and the German Ordinance on Consumer Goods_
(Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung) include special regulations which aim at preventing possible damage to human
health caused by textiles, especially due to toxic substances or contamination. Similarly, the German Chemicals
Prohibition Ordinance (Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung) prohibits the placing on the market of certain substances
and preparations as well as products containing such substances or preparations as listed in detail therein.
Furthermore, textiles may only be made available on the German market if they comply with the German Product
Safety Act (Produktsicherheitsgesetz) which is based on Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council of December 3, 2001 on general product safety (“Product Safety Directive”) and complements
the EU regulations on market surveillance and compliance of products (Regulation (EC) 765/2008 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of July 9, 2008, as amended, setting out the requirements for accreditation and
market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of June 20, 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products). Under
German jurisdiction, this regulation is accompanied by the Market Surveillance Act (Marktüberwachungsgesetz)
which came into force on July 6, 2021.

These provisions on product safety apply to a wide variety of non-food products, including clothing and footwear
and are applicable to both the e-commerce and physical stores. They oblige retailers to ensure that their products
comply with applicable safety requirements. Moreover, a retailer is generally required to participate in the
monitoring of the safety of its products. Infringements of product safety regulations may be sanctioned with fines
and in severe cases with criminal sanctions.

We are further subject to the Regulation (EU) 1007/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
27 September 2011 on textile fiber names and related labelling and marking of the fiber composition of textile
product pursuant to which textiles may only be made available on the European market if they are labeled or
marked with certain information, in particular regarding textile fibers. Depending on the implementing laws of
the EU member states, infringements of the textile labeling requirements may constitute administrative offenses.
In Germany the Regulation is supplemented by the Act on Textile Labeling (Textilkennzeichnungsgesetz). This
law creates the necessary conditions for effective enforcement of the Regulation (EU) 1007/2011 and, in
particular, lays down regulations on the powers of the authorities involved in market surveillance and on
administrative offences. Administrative offenses may be sanctioned with a fine of up to €10,000. Moreover,
violations of the provisions may be considered as unfair trade practices which are prohibited under the German
Act Against Unfair Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb). As regards sold footwear, Directive
94/11/EC of European Parliament and Council of 23 March 1994, as amended, on the approximation of the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of the EU Member States relating to labelling of the materials used in
the main components of footwear for sale to the consumer is applicable. The German legislator transposed the
directive into national law by means of the German Ordinance on Consumer Goods which contains regulations
concerning the content and form of footwear labeling.

**_Regulations on Packaging and Waste_**

We are subject to statutory provisions regarding waste management and packaging. Directive 2008/98/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of November 19, 2008 on waste (European Waste Framework Directive),
as amended, provides for the legislative basis of a recycling society in the EU. Its provisions on the collection,
transport, recovery and disposal of waste requires the EU Member States to take appropriate measures for
prevention of waste as a matter of priority and to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering
human health or causing harm to the environment. In Germany, the main waste disposal provisions are set forth
in the Waste Management Act (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz) which is supplemented and concretized by a number
of regulations.

Online retailers are subject to regulations on packaging. Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste
and its German implementation law, the Packaging Act (Verpackungsgesetz) aim to reduce the impact of
packaging waste on the environment. To this end, various obligations are imposed on the manufacturers and
retailers. The German Packaging Act requires both to participate in a disposal and recycling system and imposes
certain takeback obligations. Typically, these requirements are complied with by registering one’s activities in the
German waste packaging register and paying a license fee based on the amount of packaging waste put into

131


-----

circulation. In general, online retailers are only responsible for the shipping packaging. When importing products,
however, the retailer may also be responsible for sales packaging. Infringements of these regulations may be
sanctioned by administrative fines of up to €200,000.

**_Regulations on Cyber Security_**

We are also subject to regulations on cybersecurity. The GDPR and national laws like the German BDSG and
TDDDG require us to implement certain technical and organizational measures to protect our customers’ data and
IT systems. These measures may include physical security against unauthorized access and manipulation,
password security, reasonable encryption as well as protection against accidental data loss, destruction, or damage.
In case of a personal data breach, we are obliged to notify the breach to the competent data protection authority
within 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to
the rights and freedoms of natural persons. When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons, we are also required to communicate the personal data breach to the
affected data subject without undue delay.

**_Regulations on Payment Process_**

Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 25, 2015 on payment
services in the internal market, among others, covers online-based payment services, provides for a uniform
regulation of payments via internet and mobile phones and increased customer protection and requirements for
user authentication, such as two-factor authentication. The German legislator has adopted the Law on the
transposition of Payment Services Directive Two (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Zweiten Zahlungsdiensterichtlinie)
which mainly amended the German Payment Services Supervision Act (Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz) and the
German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch).

**_Supply Chain Duty of Care Act and CSDDD_**

On January 1, 2023, the German Supply Chain Duty of Care Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz¸ “Supply
**Chain Duty of Care Act”) became generally effective. The legislation requires affected companies to conduct**
adequate due diligence throughout their supply chains in relation to human rights and (certain) environmental
risks. This includes conducting a risk analysis, establishing internal responsibilities for human rights and
environmental protection, comprehensive preventative measures, and grievance mechanisms. Additionally,
companies concerned are obliged to continuously document the fulfillment of due diligence obligations and to
keep records in this respect for at least seven years. In an annual report, which must be published on the company’s
website and submitted electronically to the competent authority, companies must report on their adherence to due
diligence obligations. The report needs to be submitted no later than four months after the end of the business
year. Infringements of these regulations may be sanctioned by administrative fines of up to €800,000 or, in the
case of legal entities with an average annual worldwide turnover above €400 million, up to 2% of the average
annual worldwide turnover. Since January 1, 2024, companies in Germany with generally at least 1,000 employees
are within the scope of application of the Supply Chain Duty of Care Act. In connection with this legislation, we
have implemented a risk management system designed to address human rights issues and environmental risks as
required under the Supply Chain Duty of Care Act. As part of this system, we have, among other steps,
implemented a supplier code of conduct governing supplier requirements and other preventative measures, such
as trainings.

On May 24, 2024, the Council of the European Union has formally approved the Corporate Sustainability Due
Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”), following the adoption by the European Parliament on April 24, 2024. It is
expected that the CSDDD will become effective by mid-2024 and incorporated into German law by mid-2026.
The directive aims at providing a harmonized legal framework for sustainability considerations in the supply chain
of European companies. Among other things, it will establish a corporate due diligence duty, which is aimed at
ending, preventing, mitigating, and accounting for negative human rights and environmental impacts in a
company’s own operations, including subsidiaries, and their value chains. Upon its full rollout five years after
entry into force, the CSDDD will apply to companies that have over 1,000 employees and a net worldwide
turnover above €450 million. The German Supply Chain Duty of Care Act is expected to be adapted accordingly,
as based on the implementation of the CSDDD. Due to the threshold included in the CSDDD, it is likely that the
new provision will not be applicable to us until 2028 or, if we have not reached 3,000 employees by then, 2029.

**MANAGEMENT**

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) organized under the laws
of Germany. It was incorporated on July 19, 2016.

The Issuer is registered with the commercial register of the local court of Munich (Amtsgericht) under registration
number HRB 227078 and its registered office is Margaretha-Ley-Ring 27, 85609 Aschheim, Germany.

The managing directors of the Issuer are responsible for managing the day-to-day business of the Issuer in
accordance with applicable German law and its articles of association (Satzung) (the “Articles of Association”).
In addition, according to German statutory corporate law, the managing directors must ensure appropriate control
of risk within the Issuer and its subsidiaries so that any developments jeopardizing its future as a going concern
may be identified at an early stage. The managing directors legally represent the Issuer in dealings with third
parties and in court.

The managing directors owe duties of loyalty and care _vis-à-vis_ the Issuer. In discharging their duties, the
managing directors must consider a broad range of interests, which in turn includes the interests of shareholders,
employees, creditors and, to a certain extent, the general public. The managing directors are jointly and severally
liable to the Issuer for any damages that may arise if they fail to discharge their duties.

As a basic principle under German law, a shareholder has no direct recourse against any managing director in the
event that they breach a duty vis-à-vis the Issuer. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Association, only
the shareholders’ meeting (Gesellschafterversammlung) of the Issuer (the “Shareholders’ Meeting”) may
exercise the right to bring claims for damages against the managing directors.

The Issuer has taken out a directors and officers liability insurance policy for all managing directors.

The Shareholders’ Meeting may issue instructions which are binding upon the managing directors. Instructions
that would result in violations of mandatory provisions of German corporate law and in particular, capital
maintenance rules, are in any event prohibited.

**Managing Directors**

**_General Information_**

The managing directors are responsible for managing the business of the Issuer in accordance with the German
Limited Liability Companies Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG), its
Articles of Association. The managing directors are appointed for an indefinite period, but the Shareholders’
Meeting may revoke the appointment of each managing director at any time.

The managing directors have overall responsibility for the Issuer’s business. Managing directors may not deal
with, or vote on, measures relating to proposals, arrangements or contracts between himself or herself and the
Issuer.

The ‘Articles of Association provide that it can only be legally represented by two managing directors or by one
managing director in conjunction with an authorized signatory who holds a power of attorney (Prokurist).
According to Article 7 of the Articles of Association, the shareholders’ meeting may assign sole power of
representation (Einzelvertretungsbefugnis) to certain or all of the managing directors.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

We enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates from time to time and in the ordinary course
of our business. We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the related parties or our affiliates
than they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third parties. See Note 6.2 to the Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Transactions with Holdco**

Employees of administration departments of our Holdco, such as the legal department, finance department and
people and organization department, provide administrative services to us and other Group companies. The
amount charged by Holdco to the Issuer for these services was €9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2023
(year ended December 31, 2022: €1.7 million).

**Lease Agreements**

We have entered into certain leasing agreements, some of which are concluded with private partnerships
(Gesellschaften bürgerlichen Rechts) in which two of our parent company’s supervisory board members, Amir
Borenstein and Daniel Schustermann or close members of their family, are managing directors (Geschäftsführer),
and one which is concluded with a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) in which two of Holdco’s
supervisory board members, Amir Borenstein and Daniel Schustermann, are managing directors
(Geschäftsführer) of the general partner (Komplementärin). The sites which are leased include the following
locations:

  - Parsdorfer Straße 13, Poing, Germany

**Loan to Controlling Party**

On December 23, 2022, a Group company entered into a loan agreement with PTGMidCo S.à.r.l under which the
former provided a loan of up to €3.4 million to the latter. As of December 31, 2023, the loan was drawn in an
amount of €2.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, the total amount of receivables from this loan amounted to
€3.2 million, including accrued interest. The agreed interest rate is the same as under the Existing Senior Secured
Notes (three-month EURIBOR, subject to a 1.0% floor, plus 6.0%). Repayment of the loan is due by December
31, 2027.

PTGMidCo S.à.r.l. holds 89.62% of PTGLUX S.à.r.l., which wholly owns Holdco and is therefore a controlling
party to the Issuer and the Group.

**Consultancy Agreements**

Until August, 2023, in accordance with its Articles of Association, the Issuer had an advisory board (Beirat)
comprised of eight members (the “Board Members”) which advised the managing directors on the management
of the Issuer and monitored its conduct of business. In July, 2023, following the change of the legal form of the
HoldCo from PrestigeBidCo Holding GmbH, a German limited liability company, into Best Secret Group AG, a
German stock corporation, and subsequently into Best Secret Group SE, a European stock corporation (societas
_europaea), the Group decided to move the Issuer’s advisory board members to the Holdco’s supervisory board_
and terminated the advisory board. As a result, the Company and certain Board Members entered into termination
agreements (Aufhebungsgsvereinarung) pursuant to which their respective advisory board member agreements
were terminated. Immediately thereafter Holdco and such Board Members entered into consultancy agreements
pursuant to which the Board Members were to render to the Holdco a variety of advisory services in connection
with a potentially initial public offering. Those advisory agreements contemplated, among other provisions, the
payment of an advisory fee.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements after giving effect to_
_the Transactions. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the applicable terms and conditions_
_of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual agreements, which are not final_
_and have not been executed. For further information regarding our existing indebtedness, see “Use of Proceeds,”_
_“Capitalization” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations.”_

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and structure_**

On July 14, 2022, the Issuer (as an original borrower and an original guarantor), Holdco (as midco), Best Secret
GmbH (as an original borrower and an original guarantor), Best Secret Logistik GmbH (as an original guarantor),
Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London
Branch and UniCredit Bank GmbH (as original lenders), UniCredit Bank GmbH (as facility agent) and UniCredit
Bank GmbH (as security agent) (amongst others) entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (the “Original
**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”). On or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Original**
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be amended and restated by the RCF Amendment and Restatement
Agreement. We expect the RCF Amendment and Restatement Agreement to become effective on the Issue Date.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for borrowings of up to €110.0 million on a committed basis.
The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement in euro, Swiss francs, sterling or certain other currencies (if agreed) by the drawing of cash
advances, the issue of Letters of Credit (the “Letters of Credit”) (upon the appointment of an issuing bank) and
by way of any Ancillary Facilities that may be made available thereunder (each as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time.
Borrowings are available, amongst other things, to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of
the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) including, without limitation, for payment of
interest under the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional tranches or
increase of an existing facility (including any previously incurred additional facility) under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement (the “Additional Facility Commitments”) in amounts up to the Credit Facilities Basket (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or, to the extent it is exceeded, would otherwise constitute
Permitted Debt (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). The Issuer and the lenders may agree to
certain terms in relation to the Additional Facility Commitments, including the margin, the maturity date and the
availability period (each subject to parameters as set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). There are
certain limitations (including as to maximum amount) on the ability to incur Additional Facility Commitments.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized until the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer is an original borrower and an original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility. A mechanism is
included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to accede as
additional borrowers or additional guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain conditions.
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires that, subject to, for the avoidance of doubt, the
section entitled “Guarantees” below, in the future each member of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) which is or becomes a Material Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement), or is otherwise required to become a guarantor in order to satisfy the Guarantor Coverage Test (as
defined below), becomes an additional guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, where
applicable, shall grant security over certain of its material assets in favor of the Security Agent (subject to agreed
security principles included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Agreed Security Principles”)).

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling 54 months after the 2024 Effective Date (as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding
amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the
Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility
may be re-borrowed during its availability period, subject to certain conditions. The maturity date for a facility
under an Additional Facility Commitment is the date agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR (in respect of
loans denominated in euro), SONIA (in respect of loans denominated in sterling) or SARON (in respect of loans
denominated in Swiss francs) plus, in each case, an initial margin of 3.25% per annum. The applicable margin in
respect of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be calculated in accordance with a margin ratchet (subject to
customary conditions).

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving Credit Facility
at a rate of 30% of the then applicable margin. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrear on (i) either (at
the Issuer’s sole and absolute discretion) the last day of each successive period of three Months which ends during
the availability period or each quarter date occurring during the availability period (subject to certain notification
requirements); (ii) the last day of the availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility; and (iii) if cancelled, on
the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time such
cancellation is effective.

Default interest on overdue amounts is calculated at a rate which is 1% higher than that rate applicable to the loans
under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the Facility Agent and the Security Agent in connection
with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Guarantees_**

The Issuer, Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH have provided a senior guarantee of all amounts
payable to each Finance Party (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) by them or any of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries which accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as additional borrowers or
additional guarantors.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires that (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) each subsidiary
of the Issuer that is or becomes a Material Company (which definition includes, among other things, any whollyowned member of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction (as defined below) and that has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
representing more than 5% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement),
subject to certain exceptions)) will be required to become an additional guarantor under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement within 180 days of the last date (including any applicable extension or grace period) (or such
later date as the Facility Agent may agree) on which the applicable annual financial statements for the relevant
fiscal year demonstrating that such subsidiary is a Material Company were required to be delivered.

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year of the Issuer, the aggregate EBITDA of the guarantors under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement represents less than 80% of the aggregate EBITDA of wholly-owned
members of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction (as defined below) (on a consolidated basis and excluding the EBITDA of any on-balance sheet joint
ventures and any member of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) that is not required
to or cannot become a guarantor due to legal prohibitions or the Agreed Security Principles) (subject to certain
exceptions) (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) the Issuer must, within 180 days of the last date (including any
applicable extension or grace period) (or such later date as the Facility Agent may agree) on which the applicable
annual financial statements for the relevant year were required to be delivered, cause sufficient members of the
Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) to accede to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement as additional guarantors (subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain exceptions) to satisfy
the Guarantor Coverage Test (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on such last
day of the relevant fiscal year).

“Guarantor Jurisdiction” means Germany (provided that if a borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is
incorporated in a jurisdiction which is not a Guarantor Jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of that borrower shall become
a Guarantor Jurisdiction for the purposes of the Agreed Security Principles for so long as any borrower is
incorporated in such jurisdiction).

**_Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility has been and will continue to be (subject to the Agreed Security Principles)
guaranteed by the Issuer, Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH and secured on a pari passu basis
by the same collateral that secures the Notes as further described in the section entitled “Description of Notes—
_Security.”_

(i) Holdco has granted each of a German law governed third party limited recourse share pledge over its shares in
the Issuer and a German law governed third party limited recourse security agreement over any intercompany loan
receivables owed to it by the Issuer; (ii) the Issuer has granted each of a German law governed security agreement
in respect of any material bank accounts of the Issuer located in Germany, a German law governed share pledge
agreement or agreements over its shares in Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH, and a German law
governed security agreement over material structural intercompany loan receivables owed to it; and (iii) Best
Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH have granted a German law governed security agreement over any
material structural intercompany loan receivables owed to each of them.

Any Material Company or other member of the Group (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction, and, in each case, which becomes a guarantor under the Revolving
Credit Facility, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) grant security in favor of the Security Agent over
(a) the shares it directly owns in any borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility or any Material Company and
(b) if it is a borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility or a Material Company, material structural intra-group
loan receivables owed to them.

No other security is required to be granted.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

On a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), the Issuer shall promptly notify
the Facility Agent (the “Agent Notice”) who shall promptly notify the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and any issuing bank accordingly.

At the Issuer’s option (as specified in the Agent Notice), unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer and the
Majority Lenders under (and as defined in) the Revolving Credit Facility either: (A) each lender shall be entitled
to cancel its commitments and require repayment of all its share of utilizations and payment of all amounts owing
to it under the Finance Documents (as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility) and each issuing bank shall
be entitled to require than any letters of credit issued by it are prepaid and cancelled, in each case by notification
to the Facility Agent within 15 business days of the Agent Notice, whereupon, (i) the undrawn commitments of
such lender shall, by no less than 5 business days’ prior notice to the Issuer, be cancelled and such lender shall
have no obligation to fund or participate in any new utilization ((including in any new ancillary facility or fronted
ancillary facility) (other than a Letter of Credit issued or to be issued pursuant to a renewal request or a utilization
of an ancillary facility or a fronted ancillary facility to refinance any amount falling due under an ancillary facility
or a fronted ancillary facility) and, in the case of an issuing bank, such issuing bank shall have no obligation to
issue any Letter of Credit (other than a Letter of Credit issued or to be issued pursuant to a renewal request); and
(ii) on the date falling no later than 60 days after the Agent Notice, all outstanding utilizations (including ancillary
outstandings) together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued or owing to such lender (or issuing
bank, as the case may be) shall become immediately due and payable and the relevant borrower will immediately
prepay all utilizations and amounts provided by or owing to that lender and procure that any cash collateral
provided by that lender is released and any ancillary facility, fronted ancillary facility and letter of credit is prepaid
and cancelled; or (B) all outstanding undrawn commitments of each lender shall be immediately cancelled and all
outstanding utilizations and ancillary outstandings shall become immediately due and payable, together with
accrued interest and other amounts accrued to each lender (or that lender in its capacity as issuing bank) under the

**_Financial Covenants_**

If, on any quarter date in respect of the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters, the aggregate
amount outstanding of all loan utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any other facility that has the
benefit of the springing financial covenant) (the “Springing Test Condition”) exceeds an amount equal to 40 per
cent. of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any other facility that has the benefit of the
springing financial covenant), the Issuer is required to confirm whether or not the Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio (defined as the ratio of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Indebtedness on the date of such determination to
Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent four fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such

140


-----

determination, each such term as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) on such quarter date for the
period of last twelve months ending on that quarter date (subject to certain provisions and adjustments) exceeds
4.75:1.

Any excess in the financial ratio test set out above will, subject to a grace period and certain cure and prevention
rights available to the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, constitute an Event of Default under
(and as defined in) the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Issuer is permitted to prevent or cure excesses in the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as described above
by applying any cure amount (being amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or
permitted subordinated debt) towards increasing the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (an “EBITDA Cure”) or
towards decreasing Consolidated Senior Secured Net Indebtedness (a “Net Debt Cure”) (each as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the
Revolving Credit Facility. No more than four EBITDA Cures may be taken into account during the term of the
Revolving Credit Facility with no more than two EBITDA Cures in any three successive testing periods.

The Issuer is also permitted to prevent or cure excesses in the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as described
above by recalculating the Springing Test Condition or Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for any period at any
time based upon sufficient available information (including the latest internally available financial information
for an LTM period) and, if the Springing Test Condition is not met or the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is
complied with at such time (due to prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility, cash or cash equivalents on
balance sheet or otherwise), the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio shall be deemed complied with and any prior
breach of such Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed
cured. For any such calculation, the Issuer may give pro forma effect to certain transactions (and any permitted
adjustments to Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Indebtedness, the financial covenant or
the Springing Test Condition in connection therewith) for which the applicable calculation date has occurred
following the end of the period for which such calculation is made as if such transaction had been consummated
on the first day of such period.

**_Events of Default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains substantially the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as those applicable to the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “— Events of Default.” In addition,
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains the following events of default:

  - non-compliance with the financial covenant that is not otherwise cured or prevented;

  - inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made;

  - breach of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

  - unlawfulness, repudiation, rescission, invalidity or unenforceability of the Finance Documents (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) entered into in connection with the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer, Holdco,
the Guarantors and the Trustee are party to an Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent, arrangers
and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security Agent.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions
of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall have deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the ICA on its
behalf.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the relationship
of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the Guarantors and any
other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider (as
defined below), when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers,
when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will

141

be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related
to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does
not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not
the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of the Trustees. Capitalized

securities or other debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has
been made available to or by a Topco Borrower (as defined below) which are designated by the Issuer as Topco

The Intercreditor Agreement uses the term “the Company” to refer to the Issuer and “Senior Secured Notes
**Liabilities” to refer to the Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer. It uses the term “Topco” to refer to**
Holdco and any person that becomes a direct shareholder of the Issuer and which has acceded to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Topco, and “Topco Notes Liabilities” to refer to any Topco Notes and certain other indebtedness
of Holdco.

defined above) in each case which, to the extent legally possible and subject to any Agreed Security Principles (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement (i) is
created, or expressed to be created, in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties
(or a class of Secured Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations; or (ii) in the case of any jurisdiction
in which effective security cannot be granted in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the Secured
Parties (or a class of Secured Parties), is created, or expressed to be created, in favor of (x) all the Secured Parties
(or a class of Secured Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations or (y) the Security Agent under a
parallel debt and/or joint and several creditorship or similar structure for the benefit of all the Secured Parties (or
a class of Secured Parties) in respect of the applicable Secured Obligations. Transaction Security which is not
Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities and present and future obligations of the Debtors and Third Party
Security Providers to the Secured Parties (other than the creditors under the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco
**Secured Parties”)) under the Secured Debt Documents (other than the finance documents relating to the Topco**
Liabilities (the “Topco Finance Documents”)). Transaction Security which is Topco Shared Security shall secure
all liabilities and present and future obligations (other than Excluded Swap Obligations (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement)) of any member of the Topco Group, the Debtors and Third Party Security Providers to
the Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents (including to the Security agent under the Parallel Debt)
both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in any other capacity
(the “Topco Shared Security Secured Obligations”).

The Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereunder will be Senior Secured Notes Liabilities for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement. On the Issue Date, no Second Lien Lender Liabilities, Second Lien Notes
Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be outstanding. Such liabilities and liabilities in respect of other new debt
financings may only be incurred and/or designated if not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents,
including, without limitation, the covenants applicable to the Notes described under “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants”. On the Issue Date, no Designation Date has occurred._

_Guarantees and Security: Topco Creditors_

The creditors in respect of the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Creditors”) have the right to take, accept or receive
the benefit of:

(i) any Topco Shared Security from any member of the Senior Secured Group or from any Third Party
Security Provider in respect of the Topco Liabilities if and to the extent legally possible and subject to
any agreed security principles, at the same time it is also offered either:

145


-----

(A) to the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or applicable class
thereof) in respect of their Liabilities; or

(B) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be granted in favor of the
Security Agent as agent or trustee for the Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof):

        - to the other Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof) in respect of their Liabilities; or

        - to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure, joint and several creditor structure or
agency structure for the benefit of the other Secured Parties (or applicable class thereof),

and ranks in the same order of priority as described under “Priority of Security” above, provided that all amounts
received or recovered by any Topco Creditor with respect to such Topco Shared Security are immediately paid to
the Security Agent for application as set out under “Application of Proceeds” below;

(ii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance from any member of the Senior Secured Group in respect
of the Topco Liabilities in addition to any guarantee, indemnity or assurance in the original form of any
Topco Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or given to all the Secured Parties as security
for the liabilities of the Topco Group, each Debtor and any Third Party Security Provider to the Secured
Parties under the Debt Documents if, subject to any agreed security principles:

(A) (except for any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance permitted by the Finance Documents),
the Secured Parties other than the Topco Creditors (the “Priority Secured Parties”) already
benefit from such a guarantee, indemnity or other assurance or at the same time it is also offered
to the Priority Secured Parties and ranks in the same order of priority as described under “—
_Priority of Debts” above, as applicable; and_

(B) all amounts received by any Topco Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or
assurance are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below; and_

(iii) any security, guarantee indemnity or other assurance:

(A) from any person that is not a member of the Group; and

(B) from any member of the Group:

        - in connection with any escrow or similar arrangements relating to amounts held by a person
which is not a member of the Topco Group prior to release of those amounts to a member
of the Topco Group;

        - in connection with any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment,
purchase or other discharge of any Secured Liabilities not prohibited by the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

        - as otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

No security (other than pursuant to the secured documents relating to Topco Independent Transaction Security or
Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a member of the Senior Secured Group in
respect of any Topco Liabilities.

_New Debt Financing_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing, additional,
supplemental or new financing arrangements or the assumption or incurrence of any Liabilities that will constitute,
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior
Liabilities or Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification
by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented without limitation by way of refinancing, replacement,
exchange, set-off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing

146


-----

arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt
Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person
party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized
and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as
the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking, priority guarantees and Security of the New Debt Financing, subject
to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise required by
the Issuer, substantially the same (if applicable) as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after
the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a
Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other ownership interests) in any such person
or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting
at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing)
shall be permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities
(including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual
undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject
to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a
result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is
prevented by the documentation relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an
obligation (including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security
ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

_Permitted Payments_

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility Liabilities (together
with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect thereof being the
“Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Indenture or
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a
member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers
and received by Senior Secured Creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “—Application
_of Proceeds” provided that after the Designation Date there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments_
received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of
default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien Liabilities and
Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”),
the Issuer, the members of the Senior Secured Group and Third Party Security Providers may only make specified
scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing
such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

147


-----

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is not
prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so
prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to
the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a _de minimis_
threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management
Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket
amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second Lien
**Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”),**
the Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other members of the Senior Secured Group may
only make specified scheduled payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter, action or dealing in
relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Topco
Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors

Payments”):

(i) if:

    - no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

    - no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal,
interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility

Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

    - the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco Liabilities
which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior Secured
Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit such payment have
been obtained, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest (such
other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or
liquidated damages)), is outstanding and default interest on the Topco Liabilities accrued and
payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance Document (as at the date
of the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions
relating to Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in any Topco Finance

Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other
than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower under any
prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (L) below) irrespective of
whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is not
prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any
equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt
Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents,
(B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations
(including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) and a

Topco Agent’s fees, costs and expenses not exceeding €1,500,000, but excluding the costs of any
litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (or their affiliates), (C) of any

Finance Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Topco
Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding €2,500,000 in any 12 month period, (G) of
any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment
Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has
been capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is
outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during
such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made
if certain events of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities
or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior
Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, made in
connection with all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Issuer (“Debt for Equity Swap”)
provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does
not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance
Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member
of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Issuer
that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities
and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors
and Second Lien Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group
Liabilities or Subordinated Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group, (I) of non-cash
interest made by way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is subordinated

maintenance costs and expenses of a Topco Borrower or its affiliates, (K) funded directly or indirectly
with the proceeds of Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L)
by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and such
payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such
payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group
without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the
Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to
prepayment upon illegality or replacement of lenders and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing, of principal, interest or any other amounts
made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity
date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of
the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security Providers
may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance Documents
and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the occurrence
of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of
default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the
instructions of the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the
instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any
Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising
that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments
by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

149


-----

(ii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iii) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been
remedied or waived;

(iv) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Senior Secured
Creditors, Super Senior Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop
notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes
Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of
Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default.
No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default
shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event
of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement
**Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.**

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to make
any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt Documents
even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of interest (if
any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment
stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
**Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments**
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest to
occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date
and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”)

150


-----

(the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date)
receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors
under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds”;_

(b) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(c) any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider
(other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance
with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(e) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor or any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which
is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor or member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will (except, with respect to Intra-Group Liabilities, in the case of a Creditor that is an Intra-Group
Lender, if and to the extent compliance with such provisions would expose the directors of that Intra-Group Lender
to the risk of becoming personally liable pursuant to Section 43 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act
(GmbHG) or, in relation to an Intra-Group Lender not incorporated in Germany, pursuant to similar rules under
applicable law):

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (1) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (2) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to
the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from
any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the
enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or
the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts which
should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

151


-----

_Effect of Insolvency Event_

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any
resolution or making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or
reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a composition, compromise, assignment, or arrangement
with any class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party) in connection with or as a result of any
financial difficulty on the part of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider; (c) a moratorium is declared in
relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any analogous
procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings,
proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as
permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or any Permitted Second Lien Facility
Agreement or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of that Debtor or Third Party Security Provider (in the case of a Senior
Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent
until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such
distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take
Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take
other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor,
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the
Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

_Security Enforcement Regime_

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the Transaction
Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group,

provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than fifty (50)% of the
Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured
**Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Super Senior**
Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to

Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date”
below;

    - on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but

instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Instructing
Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and
(B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below),
an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien
Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement,
or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as
applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease
enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a
Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing Group
or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or refrain
from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction Security as
they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction
Security do not give such instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing
Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group
sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group. Unless (i) the
Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the Instructing Group or
any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that to do so could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction
Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any such instructions to enforce the
Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the creditors represented by an Instructing Group will
be required to consult with each other agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be
consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten Business Days or take
any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give the
enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such Consultation
Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has
become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish
to issue enforcement instructions, they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement
**Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.**

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to

153


-----

instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not either made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions
before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior
Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the
Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security
Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”)
(acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors
to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors
(as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease
enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal an agent or
trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors
or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give such instruction and do not
indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super
Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the
paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit
and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

(i) “Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that to the
extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen should
maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and (iii)
enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or other
competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or
Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants
or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any
of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under the above
provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may
include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the Transaction
Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security Documents except
through the Security Agent.

The Secured Parties grant (and undertake to grant in favor of the Security Agent at its request, by means of a
notarized power of attorney (and apostilled) if necessary), as many powers as the Security Agent may require in
order to take all necessary action in order to enforce any of the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

154

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in respect
of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing the Topco
Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee
or the Topco Borrower;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes Trustee,
Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying any agent
under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), the Super Senior Agent, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of
default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a Topco
Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco
Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or a
Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

156


-----

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve
or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco
Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted
remedy); and

(v) the first date on which the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and
the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have given their consent to the relevant Enforcement
Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to
a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other relevant event of default in respect of the Topco
Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by giving not less than 10
days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, elect to purchase all, but not part of, the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second
Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay
or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the
counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to
specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been
terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a Transaction
Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is irrevocably
authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement, instruction, direction,
confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information from any creditor, other Secured
Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Issuer to the Security Agent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Issuer
has confirmed is the subject of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release
and/ or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a
disposal to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any
obligation of any member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to
provide replacement security; or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document
pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior
Secured Group; and

157


-----

in each case where such disposal or other transaction is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) (in each case, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the
Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect any
amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any
action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of
the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor
simultaneously with such release to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to
be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed
Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release is
otherwise, in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and/or return any physical
collateral or take such other action in order to facilitate any transaction not prohibited by the
Secured Debt Documents; and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured
Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other
member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member
of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the
Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt
Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction Security
or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim
relating to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii) above, the Issuer shall confirm
in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date of
completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal
or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall confirm in
writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the
extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other transaction or designation is not
prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or
primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all liabilities
outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable creditors concurrently with ceasing to be a member of
the Topco Group or Debtor; and any right to decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any Debt Document
shall be disapplied to the extent that if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all such liabilities in
full by such person (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or other
payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

The Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super Senior Liabilities,
Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender Liabilities (each, a
“Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that Borrower
(a “Debt Pushdown”) provided that (i) such Debt Pushdown is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any
holding company of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the
proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that
Borrower’s liabilities under the applicable Finance Documents, and (ii) the transferee in respect of such Debt
Pushdown is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management

158


-----

Facility Liabilities or Second Lien lender Liabilities (as applicable). Any Debt Pushdown may (and shall upon the
request of the Issuer) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries and not as physical cash movement
to repay and reborrow any applicable liabilities.

The Security Agent is authorized and instructed by and on behalf of each creditor to execute any document
(including any amendments or variations to the Debt Documents) and take any further action as may reasonably
be requested by the Issuer to give effect to any Debt Pushdown.

_Distressed Disposals_

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member
of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any asset of that Third Party
Security Provider which is subject to Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an
acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made (including, without
limitation, the disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities of a member of the Group which have
been appropriated or foreclosed in accordance with the terms of such Transaction Security), (b) by enforcement
of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for
enforcement was made, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event which has occurred and is continuing
or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which has occurred and is
continuing, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the
Topco Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized at the cost of
the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or
Debtor:

(A) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or
enter into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the
Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(B) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that
Debtor over any of its assets or the holding company of that Debtor over that Debtor’s shares,
and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on
behalf of the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(C) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security
granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor
or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that
Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors provided that, in relation to any IntraGroup Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities, the Security Agent shall not be entitled to release such
Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities if and to the extent such release would expose the
directors of the relevant Intra-Group Lender or the relevant Debtor to the risk of becoming
personally liable pursuant to Section 43 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act
(GmbHG) or, in relation to an Intra-Group Lender or Debtor not incorporated in Germany,
pursuant to similar rules under applicable laws;

(D) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding
company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

159


-----

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a
Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement)
to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those
liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document,
the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured
Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(A) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving
**Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary**
of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor,
to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(i) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to
which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those
obligations; and

(ii) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which
is also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part
of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors
on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

Any enforcement limitations or limitations on the application of enforcement proceeds agreed in the Transaction
Security over any Intra-Group Liabilities and/or any Debtor Liabilities shall apply mutatis mutandis to any
disposal or transfer pursuant to paragraph (iv) above and in relation to paragraph (v) above (A) to any Intra-Group
Lender and creditor of Debtor Liabilities if and to the extent the Receiving Entity is of a weaker credit than the
Disposed Entity or (B) in case the Receiving Entity is a member of the Group, to such member of the Group, in
each case as if such disposal or transfer was an enforcement of such Transaction Security.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction_
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not
occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed
to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

160


-----

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to
any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities
and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case
of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, any Second Lien Liabilities, any Topco
Liabilities, any Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities or any Unsecured Liabilities would otherwise be

liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those
borrowing liabilities.

Obligations may be applied towards the payment of such Excluded Swap Obligations.

**_Equitable Subordination_**

Notwithstanding the provisions described above under “Order of Application—Transaction Security” and “Order
_of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security”, to the extent that the Recoveries held by the Security_
Agent are insufficient to discharge the liabilities owed to all creditors in any class of creditors and this is due
(whether in whole or in part) to any creditor (“Equitably Subordinated Creditor”) whose commitments, any
other participation rights (including by way of sub-participation) and/or any other rights and claims under the
Debt Documents against a Debtor incorporated in Germany which, prior to or in an insolvency of the Debtor,
would be subordinated or could be subject to potential avoidance claims pursuant to certain provisions under the
German Insolvency Code or the German Avoidance Act (“Equitably Subordinated Liabilities”) being part of
that class of creditors, the amount to be applied by the Security Agent in discharge of the liabilities of that class
of creditors shall be distributed to the other creditors of that class and the Equitably Subordinated Creditor shall
not be entitled to receive any part of that amount. An Equitably Subordinated Creditor shall not have the benefit,

164


-----

but only the obligations under, of any sharing provisions in the Debt Documents, and shall not be entitled to
receive any payment and neither the Security Agent nor the agent shall be required to make any payment to the
Equitable Subordinated Creditor, under or in connection with the Debt Documents in respect of any Equitably
Subordinated Liabilities.

To the extent that any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities would result in the subordination of liabilities towards
any other creditors under any Debt Document pursuant to Section 39 para. 1 no. 5 of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) or prejudice the validity or enforceability of any Transaction Security or guarantee and/or
indemnity provided to any creditor pursuant to the Debt Documents in any way, the relevant Equitably
Subordinated Creditor shall be deemed not to be a Secured Party under any Transaction Security Document and
shall not benefit from the guarantee or indemnity.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior Liabilities,
Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date on which
certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne
by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement
Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the
relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put
the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in
those proportions except that no Recoveries attributable to a Debtor in respect of any Excluded Swap Obligations
may be applied towards the payment of such Excluded Swap Obligations.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security Agent,
provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such
amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of
the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the
affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) and the Issuer shall be
required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to, among
other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior
Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under
the Intercreditor Agreement (solely in their capacity as such) and would not materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors, in each case other than the Cash
Management Facility Lenders (solely in their capacity as such)),

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement
(solely in their capacity as such) and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of
any other creditor or class of creditors, in each case other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their
capacity as such)), and

(iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents
or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations
in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision
affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the relevant Security Agent
(a) may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents
under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be
binding on each party, and (b) without prejudice to any further assurance provision in any Debt Document, may
if the Issuer consents, and shall promptly upon request of the Issuer, amend, release and/or retake any document
creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security where such amendment or release and
retake is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security (as applicable), together with any related or consequential waiver
(including by reason of a failure to register any relevant document with Companies House within the prescribed
time limit set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case any payment or other obligation or
default arising out of such failure to register shall also be automatically and irrevocably waived) and any such
amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each Party.

The prior consent of the Secured Creditors and the Issuer is required to authorize any such amendment, release or
waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, if the amendment, waiver or consent may impose new or additional obligations
on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any Party other than in the case of a Secured Creditor (other than an agent
or arranger), in a way which affects or would affect Secured Creditors of that Party’s class generally, or in the
case of a Debtor, to the extent consented to by the parent, the consent of that party is required.

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations which
are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation,
any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected
without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security
_Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_

(i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claims or liabilities, or

(ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt
or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—
_Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with_
the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the
Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to:

(i) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(ii) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose
provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(iii) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

166


-----

(iv) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other
Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or
which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

then, in each case, any creditor:

(A) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days or if such Secured Creditor or
Unsecured Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) is a Defaulting Lender (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), five Business Days (or any other period of time notified
by the Issuer, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision to operate
is less than ten (10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(B) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent
then at the Issuer’s option:

1. that the creditor’s participation (as the case may be) shall be deemed to be zero for the
purpose of calculating their participation in respect of the matter when ascertaining
whether any relevant percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of
their participation or has been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve
that action;

2. that the creditor’s status shall be disregarded for the purposes of ascertaining whether
the agreement of any specified group of creditors has been obtained to give that
consent, carry that vote or approve that action; and

3. that creditor shall be deemed (other than for the purposes of determining any consent
fee or similar arrangement) to have given its consent or agreement to such request (or
to have given such confirmation or notification) and such consent, agreement,
confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been received by the Security
Agent, and such consent, agreement, confirmation or notification shall from such time
be irrevocable and binding on such creditor and its permitted successors, assigns and
transferees,

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any Noteholder in
respect of any request where such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative
but shall otherwise apply to all Noteholders.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

On or following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a
holding company thereof) (an “IPO Event”)), the Issuer is entitled to give notice to each agent and each Hedge
Counterparty (a “Pushdown Notice”) that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate (with effect
from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown Date”)) so that, amongst other
things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO
(the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the IPO Pushdown
Date, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any
Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio, basket financial definition calculations
shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be
assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity (or as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the relevant
Debt Documents), (iii) each reference in the Debt Documents to the Issuer or any holding company of the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and
unless the context requires otherwise) (iv) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations,
undertakings and events of default), will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (v)
no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall directly or
indirectly result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking of event of default, (vi) each holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations and
restrictions under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security) and (viii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer, each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security
Provider, Investor (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be

167


-----

irrevocably and unconditionally released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement
in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities, noteholders
representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in
any Permitted Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien
Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing
more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown
Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the
Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement
shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate
such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary, provided that certain “excluded matters” provisions in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement shall not be overruled by the Intercreditor Agreement and shall apply _mutatis mutandis in the_
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement following the Issue Date_

On the First Optional Par Redemption Date the Intercreditor Agreement shall be amended and restated by way of
an English law governed amendment and restatement deed between the Issuer, the Facility Agent, the Security
Agent and the Trustee as follows:

a) borrowing liabilities and guarantee liabilities shall refer to all liabilities arising under the Debt

Documents, rather than being limited to liabilities in respect of Financial Indebtedness;

b) the definition of Financial Indebtedness shall be clarified such that any exception to the term which

excludes Subordinated Liabilities from its scope shall be disregarded;

c) where a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors or

Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions, prior to the Designation
Date, it shall be clarified that the Security Agent shall not be authorized to release any other liabilities
(in addition to any applicable borrowing or guarantee liabilities) unless those other liabilities (in
addition to any applicable borrowing or guarantee liabilities) will be paid in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to letters of credit or certain cash management / ancillary facilities, cash
collateralized in a manner acceptable to the relevant creditors) following that release;

d) a Creditor’s right to have borrowing liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer instead of

being released shall be extended to apply to guarantee and other liabilities (not being borrowing
liabilities);

e) in the event that a Topco is no longer a direct shareholder of the Issuer, such person shall cease to be a

party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Topco and shall have no further rights or obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement as Topco provided that another person that has become a direct shareholder of
the Company accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Topco; and

f) a Third Party Security Provider or Topco Independent Obligor shall cease to be a party to the Intercreditor
Agreement in such capacity if it ceases to own the charged property over which it has granted Transaction
Security (in accordance with the terms of the Debt Documents).

**Supply Chain Financing Arrangements**

Since October 2021, we have entered into arrangements with cflox GmbH (“cflox”) for payment services relating
to the settlement of supplier liabilities in order to optimize working capital. Pursuant to the terms of the
arrangements, supplier invoices are settled according to their terms by Best Secret GmbH and financed by cflox
through financing arrangements obtained through Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Norddeutsche Landesbank
– Girozentrale and UniCredit Bank GmbH (the “cflox Financing Partners”) and subsequently reimbursed by
Best Secret GmbH not later than 90 days. The financing arrangements are uncommitted and provide for an
aggregate amount of up to €100.0 million.

168


-----

Certain cflox Financing Partners acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as Cash Management Facility Creditor
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and the relevant obligations under such supply chain financing
arrangements are secured on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes. The agreements in relation to the
cflox supply chain financing arrangements are governed by German law.

The liabilities in connection with the supply chain financing are presented in our consolidated statement of
financial position under “other current financial liabilities.” As of March 31, 2024, we had €89.1 million of
liabilities in connection with our supply chain financing (as of December 31, 2023: €38.7 million). The programs
are generally utilized to optimize working capital seasonality.

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading
“Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer” are to
PrestigeBidCo GmbH, and its successors, only and not to any of its Subsidiaries. References to “we” or “us” or
the “Group” are to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Issuer will issue EUR 550 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due

Trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, calculation agent and transfer
agent (the “Transfer Agent”), Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Registrar (the “Registrar”), Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch as calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”) and UniCredit Bank GmbH, as security agent
(the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We
urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they,
and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum
under the caption “Listing and General Information.”

The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used, along with certain cash on
balance sheet, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds,”: (i) to repay and
redeem the Existing Notes on, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date, (ii) to fund a distribution to
the shareholder of the Issuer and (iii) to pay certain fees and expenses in relation to the Transactions. On the Issue
Date, the Issuer will deposit the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes into a depository account pursuant to the
terms of a depository agreement dated on or prior to the Issue Date, among the Issuer and Deutsche Bank
Aktiengesellschaft, as depository agent, until the redemption date of the Existing Notes, which is expected to be
July 15, 2024, which is first date the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Existing Notes at a redemption price of
100.000%, or soon after. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis. See “—The Note
_Guarantees.”_

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security
and guarantees and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other
remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain
transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture.
However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we
will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the
Notes.

**The Notes**

The Notes will:

  - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer incurred
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain cash management obligations (including our
Supply Chain Financing), if any, and certain Hedging Obligations, if any;

170


-----

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value
of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation; and

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH (the “Initial Guarantors”) will
guarantee the Notes on a senior basis. If required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles,_
certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future (the “Additional Guarantors”
and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). The Note Guarantees will be joint and several
obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

  - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (including such Guarantor’s
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations);

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention
of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things,
might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant
Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied
with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply
to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility
and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal
limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the
creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of March 31, 2024, the unaudited consolidated
total assets of the Guarantors represented 90.8% of the unaudited consolidated total assets of the Group and for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the unaudited aggregated unconsolidated EBITDA of the Guarantors
represented all of the unaudited aggregated unconsolidated EBITDA of the Issuer and its subsidiaries (as defined
in this Offering Memorandum and disregarding the EBITDA of any member of the Group that generates negative
EBITDA). Claims of creditors of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors and
creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders

171


-----

(if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The
Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors)
and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority
stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

  - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the
sale or other disposition;

  - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all
the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the Indenture;

  - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

  - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in
“—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

  - upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;_

  - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that (i) such Guarantor is unconditionally released and
discharged from its liabilities with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination and release and (ii) such Guarantor would not otherwise be required
at the time of such release to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;_

  - in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

  - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

  - in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

  - with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors.”_

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee
and the Security Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part
of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

The Notes will be represented by one or more registered Notes in global registered form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

172


-----

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue EUR 550 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will
mature on      , 2029. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of EUR 100,000 and integral
multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of
(i) three-month EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus (ii)      %, as determined by the Calculation Agent.

Interest on the Notes will:

  - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

  - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on      ,      ,       and      , commencing on      ,
2024;

  - be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related
interest payment date; and

  - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and the actual number
of days elapsed on the aggregate principal amount outstanding.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than
the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Notes.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Notes.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits
in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11.00 a.m. London time, on the
Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a
Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks
in the Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed
as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11.00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, to prime
banks in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such
offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.
If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London or
Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of
approximately 11.00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in
euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will
be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest
Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure
specified in this paragraph is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of determining
the Applicable Rate for such Interest Period.

If the Issuer determines in good faith prior to any Determination Date, that:

(1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

173


-----

(4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital
markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to
calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR,

the Issuer in consultation with a Rate Determination Agent shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is
substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary
authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body
or that has developed or is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as
or comparable to the Notes (and any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent
reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as
a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate
(the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the
Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least two Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such
Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation,
verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the
Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further
action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee provided that if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the
information provided by the Issuer with respect to such Successor Rate or Adjustment Spread (if any) to
calculate, or calculate definitely, the interest rate applicable to the Interest Period commencing immediately
following notification thereof, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in
effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. For the avoidance of doubt, if, in any case,
that rate determined in accordance with the above is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero. The
Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread).
Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to “EURIBOR” in the
Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).None of the Trustee,
the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or inaction of the Issuer
or its determination of the Successor Rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the Trustee, Paying
Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with such new rate
which may, in its opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to any additional liabilities
or increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections.

“Eurozone” means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include      , 2024.

“Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the
Issuer at the expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under
(a), the Issuer.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (1) EUR 1.0 million and (2) an amount that is representative for
a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the real time gross settlement system operated by the
Eurosystem or any successor system (T2) is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate
to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each
such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages
resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545%

174


-----

(or.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or.0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the
Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default or manifest error, be final and
binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the
rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment
is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such
delay. The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes will be subject to the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be
made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by
the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer,
by bank transfer to the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial
Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a Registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer Agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from
time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the
Issuer. A register of the Notes shall be maintained at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency
between the register of the Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the
register kept by the Issuer shall prevail. The Registrar has no responsibility for any register maintained by the
Issuer.

If Definitive Registered Notes are in circulation and there is a discrepancy between the register of the Registrar
and the register of the Issuer, on consultation between the Issuer and the Registrar, the Issuer will amend the
register to reflect the register of the Registrar.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Notes.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to issue_
additional Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially identical to this series of
Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied
to the Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the issue price and issuance date of such Additional Notes;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and
if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates,

175


-----

the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest
shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of Holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest
will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the maturity date, and the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which,
and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of EUR 100,000 and in integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof,
the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

In the Issuer’s sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pertaining to
(a) the redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, pursuant to any
special mandatory redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance
of such Additional Notes are deposited is conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment,
refinancing or other transaction (such redemption, a “Special Mandatory Redemption”), (b) the escrow of all or
a portion of the proceeds of such Additional Notes and the granting of Liens described in clause (22) of the
definition of “Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security agent solely for the benefit of the holders of
such Additional Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the holders of any other Notes,
including Notes of the same series as such Additional Notes), together with all necessary authorizations for the
Trustee or such security agent to enter into such arrangements provided that, for so long as the proceeds of such
Additional Notes are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and shall not be subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall not benefit from any security
interest in the Collateral. In addition, such Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such
Additional Notes are issued bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code pending the satisfaction of certain
conditions, such as the consummation of an acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such
Additional Notes bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code may be automatically exchanged for new
Additional Notes bearing the same CUSIP, ISIN or common code as any existing Notes issued; provided that such
Additional Notes are fungible with the Notes issued on the relevant issue date for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects
to such other series, and shall be deemed to form one series with other series (including, if applicable, such Notes)
(it being understood that any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other
series of Notes but for being subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially
identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration of any provisions relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption).

All series of Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
any applicable series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description
_of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue_
Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as any other
series of Notes, including the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to such other series, and shall be deemed to form one series with such other series.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:

  - each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue

176


-----

Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

  - each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition,
transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected
by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S
**Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written**
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction._

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of EUR 100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on
transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of EUR 100,000 in principal amount
and integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear
or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection
with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other
than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes to be
redeemed in part;

177


-----

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, and in any case within 30 days, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, on an equal and ratable
first-priority basis by:

1. a German law governed third party limited recourse share pledge granted by HoldCo over its shares in

the Issuer;

2. a German law governed third party limited recourse security agreement granted by HoldCo over any

intercompany loan receivables owed to it by the Issuer;

3. a German law governed account pledge granted by the Issuer in respect of any material bank accounts of

the Issuer located in Germany;

4. a German law governed share pledge granted by the Issuer over its shares in Best Secret GmbH and Best

Secret Logistik GmbH;

5. a German law governed security agreement granted by the Issuer over any material structural

intercompany loan receivables owed to it;

6. a German law governed security agreement granted by Best Secret GmbH over any material structural

intercompany loan receivables owed to it; and

7. a German law governed security agreement granted by Best Secret Logistik GmbH over any material

structural intercompany loan receivables owed to it,

subject to certain customary limitations and exceptions (the “Collateral”).

The assets that comprise the Collateral also secures (or will secure) on a first-priority basis liabilities under the
Revolving Credit Facility, certain cash management obligations (including our Supply Chain Financing) and
certain Hedging Obligations and may also secure certain future Indebtedness (including any Additional Notes).
The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders of the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this issuance of Notes.
By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. References to firstpriority security interests include security interests that were created subsequent in time and thus in ranking, but
are solely contractually, but not in rem, pari passu with prior ranking security and entitled to equal treatment with
other prior ranking security secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the_
_Notes.”_

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets_
may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including (but not
limited to) the following:

  - no security interests shall be granted (i) by a member of the Group which is not incorporated, organized
or established under the laws of Germany or any other jurisdiction in which a borrower under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is incorporated for so long as any borrower is incorporated in such
jurisdiction (each a “Guarantor Jurisdiction”); and/or (ii) over any asset which is not located in a
Guarantor Jurisdiction;

178


-----

- no security or guarantees shall be required to be given by (or over shares or investments in) any joint
venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or by (or over shares or investments in) any member
of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group, provided that, all security will
be governed by the law of, and secure only assets located in, the applicable Guarantor Jurisdiction;

- security shall be limited to: (i) the shares directly owned in a borrower, including the shares in the Issuer
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or a Material Company (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement); (ii) intragroup loan receivables owed to Holdco the applicable borrower or
Material Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); and (iii) only in the case of
the Issuer, material bank accounts of the Issuer located in Germany;

- all security shall be governed by the law of, and shall secure only assets located in, the jurisdiction of,
incorporation of the guarantor except in respect of share security (which shall be governed by the law of
the jurisdiction of the applicable borrower or Material Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) over which such security is granted);

- the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security may be prohibited, restricted or
limited by an amount or otherwise, including as a result of general legal and statutory limitations,
regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions,
corporate benefit, capital maintenance, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “interest
stripping,” “earnings stripping,” capital maintenance rules and liquidity impairment rules, “controlled
foreign corporation,” transfer pricing or “thin capitalization” rules, “liquidity impairment” rules, tax
restrictions, exchange control restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements (including supervisory board or “works council” rules) and similar principles. If any such
limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited accordingly; provided that, the relevant
member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost or fees and
without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such limitation;

- in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken (and in
respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration), the applicable time, cost and
adverse effect shall be taken into account. This would mean taking into account factors such as adverse
effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration fees, costs and taxes, notarial costs,
translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or
maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any recourse or non-recourse
factoring (including reverse factoring), arrangements, receivables financings, trust receipts, invoice
discounts or similar arrangements (in each case permitted under the Indenture) and that the time, adverse
effect and cost to be incurred shall not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders of such
guarantee or security;

- assets of the Group maybe subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory
constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party
arrangement which may prevent or condition that asset from being charged, secured or being subject to
the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or
works council (or equivalent)). Any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would
give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with
respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require any member of the Group to take
any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, will be excluded from
a guarantee or security document provided that, reasonable endeavors exercised for a specified period of
time which shall be no longer than 20 Business Days (but without incurring material cost or fees and
without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to obtain consent to charging any such assets
(where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent (acting on instructions of
the Holders) specifies that the relevant asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors
will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in
relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent
the creation of transaction security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or
customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- guarantees or entry into security documents shall not be required of members of the Group if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary

179


-----

or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual
prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability
for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group; provided that, the relevant member of the
Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact
on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such security or guarantee
document shall be limited accordingly;

  - the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security
granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant
member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted
by the finance documents including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or
amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case
prior to an acceleration event which is continuing, and any requirement under the Agreed Security
Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action is subject to this principle;

  - no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap
Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;

  - no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement; and

  - no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required.

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally
available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law, see “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (if any), (c) the counterparties
under certain cash management facilities (if any); (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes
under the Indenture, and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral,
respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility, which
provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes are secured
contractually, but not in rem, equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests. In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement,” “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—_
_Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, Holdco, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors have granted or will grant security
over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under
the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the relevant security
provider and the Security Agent, and the Trustee acting for itself and in its capacity as the Trustee under the
Indenture. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an Agent of the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain other future indebtedness in relation to the
Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
Holders of Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of Notes will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent or the

180


-----

Trustee (as applicable) under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the
Collateral until all obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture have been discharged.
However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security
Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor
Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were to be successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts
under the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Agreed Security Principles, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer, Holdco and any Guarantors will have the right
to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the
property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including
any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of any
Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the
Security Agent. Since the Holders will not be a party to the Security Documents, Holders will not, individually or
collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders
may only act through the Security Agent or the Trustee (as applicable). To the extent permitted by the applicable
laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, Holders of the Notes will, in
certain circumstances, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide instructions to the Security Agent for the
enforcement of security over the Collateral. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of
the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests
created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility, certain cash management providers (if any) or certain hedge counterparties (if any). The ability to
enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the
Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The validity and enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral” and “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting
a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as their respective agent under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security
Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note,
each Holder of the Notes will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent under the Indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement (as applicable) to: (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions
that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security
Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and that the
Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders of the Notes) to enter into
the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

181


-----

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents;

(3) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(4) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such
provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the
Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or
_Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of the Permitted Senior Financing Debt and the Senior Secured_
_Notes and the Transaction Security.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any_
amendment or supplement to, release of, waiver under or replacement of any debt document (including the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Security
Documents) required by the Issuer (or another member of the Group) and/or take such other action as is required
by the Issuer (or another member of the Group) in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by
this paragraph, _provided that any such amendment, supplement, waiver, replacement or other document,_
instrument or action will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the
reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the
_Collateral—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_
_will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Holdco, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to release the Security
Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—_
_Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance_
with the Indenture, or (b) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary provided that this clause 1(b) shall not
be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or accounts receivable to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless (subject to the Agreed Securities Principles) the
relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the
Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

182


-----

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with the granting of Liens or rights with respect to property and assets, which may include
Collateral, or the sale or transfer of property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case
pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(7) in connection with a Public Offering within a reasonable time to facilitate such Public Offering; provided
that such Security Interests so released shall be promptly granted in favor of the Notes in the event that
the Public Offering does not complete for any reason;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(9) in case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following the release of its Liens
granted in favor of the Revolving Credit Facility, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the release of the property and assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary_
that would result in the requirement for the Notes and the Notes Guarantees to be secured on such
property, assets or Capital Stock pursuant to covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees” or the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Liens;” or_

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer to
effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless
action is required by it to effect such release).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are
not redeemable until      , 2025. On and after      , 2025 the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time,
part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a price equal to 100.000% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but
not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, prior to      , 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes,
plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to any Note on any redemption date prior to      , 2025, the
greater of:

x) 1% of the principal amount of such Note; and

y) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

183


-----

(a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Note at     ,
2025 (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being 100.000%
(excluding accrued and unpaid interest)), _plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such_
Note from the commencement of the current Interest Period to, and including,         , 2025
(excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon the redemption date using a discount
rate equal to the Bund Rate (as defined below) at such redemption date (or, if greater than such
Bund Rate, zero) plus 50 basis points and assuming that the rate of interest on the Notes for the
period from the redemption date through     , 2025, will equal the rate of interest on the
Notes in effect on the date on which the applicable notice of redemption is given; over

(b) the outstanding principal amount of such Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate. For the avoidance
of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the Trustee or any Agent.

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations
of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled
and published in the most recent financial statistics that have become publicly available at least two Business
Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not
so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected in good faith by the Board
of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to      ,
2025); provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to      , 2025, is not equal to the constant
maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the
Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the
weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given,
except that if the period from such redemption date to      , 2025, is less than one year, the weekly average
yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of
one year shall be used, unless the redemption price is not paid on the redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, any series of or all of the Notes, if Holders of
not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or series of Notes, as applicable,
validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, in such tender offer and
the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes or series of
Notes, as applicable, validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the Notes
will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all
Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the
price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (other than any early tender premium, incentive payment or
similar payment), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

**_Optional Redemption and Satisfaction and Discharge_**

If the Issuer elects to redeem any series of the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Defeasance” or “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge,” requests that the Trustee or Paying Agent distribute (or cause to be distributed) to_
the Holders amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee or Paying Agent (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will
include accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for
redemption, the applicable redemption notice will state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust
with the Trustee or Paying Agent (i) on or promptly after the date fixed for redemption or (ii) on such earlier
payment date as selected by the Issuer.

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice.”

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close

184


-----

of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such
redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of any series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar (as
applicable) will select Notes for redemption on a _pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of_
Clearstream or Euroclear (as applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or
depository requirements; provided, however, that no Note of EUR 100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less
shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of EUR 1,000 will be redeemed, unless otherwise
required by law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements. Neither the Trustee,
the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or the part of the Notes called for
redemption. If any series of Notes is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that series
of Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive
Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any
Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the
related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall
such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent, except
that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), or such redemption
may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent) of the
relevant series of Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax
**Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due**
on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption_
or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the
next interest payment date in respect of such series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to such series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement
cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the
Payor; provided that changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this section.

185


-----

Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date,
such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such_
successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the
time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or delivery of any notice of redemption of any series of Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem
have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that
the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The
Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as conclusive
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event
it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear
of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made by or on behalf of a Payor or
any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including
payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received by the Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any
such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would
have been received by such Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account
of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or the
beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation or any Person other than the Holder to whom the Notes or any
amount payable thereon is attributable for the purposes of such Tax) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national
of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in,
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with any written request, made to that Holder or the Holder on behalf of that beneficial
owner in writing at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable, by the
Payor or applicable withholding agent: (a) to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or (b) to

186


-----

make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which, in the case of (a) or (b) (or both), is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate
of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of the
Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
permitted or required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment
to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer), plus solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) and
church tax (Kirchensteuer), if any, thereon, levied in Germany by a custodian bank or a disbursing agent
acting on behalf of the Holder;

(6) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to the Defence against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur
_Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze) as_
amended from time to time;

(7) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(8) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(9) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or official practices adopted pursuant to
an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to
the foregoing sections of the Code or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code;

(10) any combination of the items (1) through (9) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is not the beneficial owner of the
Notes, to the extent that the sole beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such
partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settler, member or beneficial owner directly held such Notes.

Each Holder entitled to any Additional Amounts shall cooperate with the Issuer and the Trustee in providing any
information or documentation reasonably requested by the Issuer or the Trustee to confirm the identity and/or tax
status of such Holder and any affected beneficial owner to the extent such information is readily available to the
Holder (to the extent necessary to establish such Holder’s entitlement to Additional Amounts) and to provide
reasonable assistance to the Issuer or Trustee in determining the applicable withholding tax rate and the amount
of Additional Amounts payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction in the minimum amount required by applicable
laws and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with
applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if,
notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts, such tax receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee.
Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and

187


-----

Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such
Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary, without further inquiry, investigation,
independent verification or liability of any kind.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption price or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or
property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or
receipt of payments with respect to any Notes or any Note Guarantee (other than in each case, (A) in connection
with a transfer of the Notes after this issuance of Notes or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue, registration
court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes or similar charges or levies becomes
payable upon a voluntary registration made by the Holder if such registration is not required by any applicable
law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any Guarantees,
the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto) and limited solely
in the case of any such Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes
imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded from the obligation to pay Additional Amounts
by any of clauses (1) through (3) or clauses (5) through (9), above (or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by
a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a
Payor is organized, incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or
any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee)
is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
“Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to
EUR 100,000 or integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; _provided that Notes of_
EUR 100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be
obligated to repurchase any series of Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event
and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series and given
notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of a series of Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied
or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer shall
deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has
the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in

188


-----

cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on
a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control
**Payment”);**

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that
the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering
Event.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes
so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election,
who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been
accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account
of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount
of such Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or
its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if
a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control
Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive
agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

189


-----

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control or Change of Control
Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the
Revolving Credit Facility.

Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon
a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a
Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of
a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after giving _pro forma effect to the_

Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and (2) to the
extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 3.0 to 1.0; provided further, however,
that Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may only Incur Indebtedness under this paragraph in an

Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to the Notes or such Note Guarantee
to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to

or series of transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise
acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time
of such acquisition or other transaction and after giving _pro forma effect to such acquisition or other_
transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness, (a) either (x) the Issuer would have been able
to Incur EUR 1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant
or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness or (b) such Indebtedness, when taken together with the principal amount of

principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the greater of EUR 50.0 million and 25% of
Consolidated EBITDA;

(15) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of joint ventures and similar
entities, Unrestricted Subsidiaries, any Similar Business or any co-investment vehicle and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not exceeding the greater of EUR 40.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(16) Sale and Leaseback Transactions (provided that the aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (16), together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (16) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of EUR
80.0 million and 40% of Consolidated EBITDA);

(17) Ordinary Course Lease Obligations; and

(18) Indebtedness under daylight borrowing facilities Incurred in connection with any refinancing of
Indebtedness (including by way of set-off or exchange) so long as any such Indebtedness is repaid within
three days of the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred;

_provided,_ _however, that Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may only Incur Indebtedness under_
clause (11) of this paragraph in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed, together with
any Indebtedness Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors under the first paragraph of this
covenant, the greater of (x) EUR 70.0 million and (y) 35% of Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and
may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) and only be required
to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the
first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date shall be deemed
initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or
clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph
above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

193


-----

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA,” Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured at
the option of the Issuer on the date on which a new commitment is obtained or the date on which new
Indebtedness is Incurred or otherwise in compliance with the covenant described under the caption “—
_Financial Calculations,” provided that if the Issuer elects to have such determination occur on the date_
on which a new commitment is obtained, such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have occurred on the
date of such new commitment and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets,
ratios or permissions under the Indenture (except to the extent such commitment is with respect to
undrawn amounts under a revolving credit facility or such commitment is subsequently canceled),
including, for the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and for
purposes of determining compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance or replace Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing or replacement Indebtedness would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA
restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of
such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance
costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of
any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness
issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of
any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions
or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or
otherwise periodically), including any revolving indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant
to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent
reborrowing thereof.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any EUR-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the EUR Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred
or first committed (whichever yields the lower EUR Equivalent); provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than EUR, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable EUR-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such EUR-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth

194


-----

in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the EUR-Equivalent of the principal amount of
any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is
subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the EUR) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in EUR will be adjusted to take into account the effect
of such agreement.

In respect of any four full fiscal quarter period, exchange rates used in relation to an item of Indebtedness may be,
at the election of the Issuer, (i) the weighted average exchange rates for that period, (ii) the exchange rate used in
the relevant financial statements as of the last day of such period, (iii) the exchange rate as in effect on the date
that Indebtedness was incurred or deemed incurred or (iv) the exchange rate on the Issue Date; _provided_ _that,_
where applicable and at the election of the Issuer, any amount of Indebtedness will be stated so as to take into
account the hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in respect of or by reference to that Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

foregoing clauses (iv), (v) or (vi); _provided further that notwithstanding the foregoing, any_
amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be included in the
calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the preceding clause (c)
will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds or
property or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event
that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the
purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or

Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock, Excluded
Amounts or Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially
concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) (i) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, (ii) meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories of Permitted Payments described in the third paragraph of this covenant, or (iii) constitutes a
Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion
thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether
owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom,
which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or
asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not
Permitted Liens if the Notes (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of Guarantors) and the Indenture are directly
secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with
respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

200


-----

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit
Facility) and any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue
Date, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Documents or any related security documents or (c) any other agreement or instrument with respect to
the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than
Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such
transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another
Person is the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary
thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews, refinances
or replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or
this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3);
_provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary_
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders
taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

201


-----

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of
all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets
that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses, concessions,
franchises or permits, including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits (including assets in
escrow accounts) paid on property;

Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit
Facility, together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in
each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or (B) the Issuer determines that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect

-----

(16) customary restrictions included in shareholder agreements, including, without limitation, those relating
to non-wholly owned Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less
than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such
Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any net cash proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
recorded on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the
date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the
Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness
as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph
of this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons
who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness
(i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of EUR 40.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market
value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the Asset
Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the definition of
Permitted Debt; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any
series of Notes and/or any other Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari
_passu basis with the Notes; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted_
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not
constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Notes, as the case may be, at a
purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid

203


-----

interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that to the
extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to purchase any amount of the Notes at a price
not less than par, to the extent Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the Issuer will
be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered, and
such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after
giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1) through (6) of
this paragraph or a combination thereof; _provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a_
permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated [an]d (y) the 180th day following the expiration of
the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds.”
Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the
Indent[ur]e.

On the 366th day[ (]or on the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a
binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clause (8) of the
second preceding paragraph) after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of EUR 40.0 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer
will be required within 30 Business Days thereof to make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders
and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a
Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes
and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid or purchased
out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and
100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of EUR 100,000 and in integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders
and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such
Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in EUR, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their
EUR Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period
(as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset
at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the relevant Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of

204


-----

such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to
be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of EUR 100,000 and in integral
multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable). The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with
the terms of this covenant. The Paying Agent shall, as soon as practicable, deliver to each applicable Holder of
Notes the purchase price of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the
appropriate amounts of Notes from such Holder’s account with Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). Any
Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the
Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of EUR
10.0 million and 5% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction, in each case, in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
EUR 20.0 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related
transactions have been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that
such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment;

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,
or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights
plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,

consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction (A) between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), (B) between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or
(C) between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Receivables Subsidiary in
connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent
(whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such
directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments
pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date
or described under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” in this Offering
Memorandum, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented,
extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this
covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the
entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

or management purposes in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, distribution
partners or franchisees, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice,
which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the
Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no
less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that
would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any
Affiliate of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity
interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or the entering into of any proceeds loan; provided that the interest rate and other
financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding or proceeds loan are approved by a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in their reasonable determination and (b) any
amendment, waiver or other transaction, including satisfying payment obligations, with respect to any
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or proceeds loan in compliance with the other provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or

Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or

_provided, however, that in the event of any natural, medical, man-made or similar catastrophe which prevents or_
otherwise unduly restricts the Issuer (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) from furnishing the reports specified
in clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph of this covenant within the time period set out therein, the Issuer shall have
the right to extend its reporting deadline up to 60 additional days after such reporting period deadline; provided,
_further, that the Issuer endeavors to provide such financial statements as soon as reasonably practicable._

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.

The Issuer will make available such information and such reports to any Holder in each case by posting such
information on its website. In the event the Issuer posts copies of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3)
of the first paragraph of this covenant on its website, it will be deemed to have furnished such reports to the
Holders or to the extent that such information cannot be posted to the Issuer’s website for any reason, if such
information has been delivered to the Trustee.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the
periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer.
In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to post on its website reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to Holders such annual
reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC
pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant by
providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer (if such entity is different
from the Issuer) so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as
to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were
references to such Parent and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with a reasonably

208


-----

detailed description of material differences between the financial condition and results of operations of such Parent
and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity
are listed on a Recognized Exchange and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and
disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such Recognized Exchange,
for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Holders such annual reports, semi-annual reports
and/or quarterly reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such
Recognized Exchange pursuant to the applicable admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the
foregoing requirements, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs; provided that if the consolidated financial statements of any Parent or the IPO Entity (if different than
the Issuer) are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the
financial condition and results of operations of such Parent or the IPO Entity and the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall be included.

Delivery of information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s
receipt thereof shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, or
determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants
under the Indenture or documents related thereto.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
**Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European**
Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer)
will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture
and (b) (in each case subject to any limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all
obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Company would
be able to Incur at least an additional EUR 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Issuer or the Successor Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which the
transaction is consummated would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any is required
in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Person that becomes

209


-----

a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any
Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person;
or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and
the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;
and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture;

_provided,_ _however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall not apply to the extent that_
compliance with clauses (a) and (b)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of
any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part
of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its
properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule,

210


-----

regulation or order, recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into
any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant
Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading
“—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganization or the solvent liquidation of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; or (vi) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or
combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such
entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of such entity; _provided,_
_however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—Issuer” or clauses (a) and (b) under the heading “—_
_The Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction._

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such
time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of
the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the Reversion
Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the
Reversion Date will constitute a Default or an Event of Default. The covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during_
the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance
of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (4)(c) of the definition of Permitted Debt. In addition, the Indenture will also permit,
without causing a Default or an Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any
contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an
Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event
and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied;
_provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this_
caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment
Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer and Holdco shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with

211


-----

respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect
to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer and Holdco shall not, and the Issuer
shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of
the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Issuer, Holdco and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted
Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, discharged and
released in accordance with the Indenture and the applicable Security Documents, or in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may
be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency
therein; (iv) the Issuer, Holdco and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement,
discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a
Permitted Reorganization and (v) the Security Interests and the related Security Documents may be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i) and
(v) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action
expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise
modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the
Security Agent either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from
an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
Holdco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as applicable), in each case after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee and the Security Agent, which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the
Security Documents, as so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced,
are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
to which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the
Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, as applicable) consent to
such amendments, extensions, renewals, restatements, releases, supplements, modifications or replacements
without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any
Credit Facility with an aggregate principal amount in excess of EUR 15 million or any other Public Debt, in each
case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10
Business Days after the date on which such Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the
Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee; _provided,_ _however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be_
obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is
contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of
any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital

212


-----

maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—The Note
Guarantees—Note Guarantees Release.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the
option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (1) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture
if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or (2) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with
the Indenture as of the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as of that date.
The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release
of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction, as applicable.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing_
clause (1), Holdco, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security
Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including substantially the same terms with
respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided that such_
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or,
in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement,
(2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including, with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes),
(5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely
affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled
to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the
Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted
below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

213


-----

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
authorized and directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the
registered office of the Issuer.

**Financial Calculations**

When determining the availability under any basket, ratio or permissions under the Indenture in connection with
any transaction or whether any transaction is permitted under the Indenture (including without limitation, testing
any Incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or Liens, the making of Restricted Payments, Permitted Payments
or Investments, any Asset Disposition, Change of Control Triggering Event, any acquisition, disposition, merger,
joint venture, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination or the fixing of any exchange rates in
connection therewith), the date of determination of such basket, ratio or permission or the testing of any such
transaction and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be (A) the date of
consummation of the relevant transaction, (B) the date that any definitive agreement, put option, unilateral
commitment, binding offer or similar arrangement in respect of such transaction is entered into, (C) the date that
any unilateral commitment or binding offer with respect to such transaction is made by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or (D) the date that any notice, which may be revocable or conditional, of any repayment, repurchase
or refinancing of any Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof.

In connection with such election, such baskets, ratios or permissions shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including
any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof and the fixing of any exchange rates in connection
therewith) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the
ability to consummate any such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets, ratios or
permissions are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket, ratio or permission (including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets, ratios or permissions will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted
hereunder and (y) any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof
and the fixing of any exchange rates) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date elected pursuant to the prior
paragraph and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets, ratios or permissions under the
Indenture (except in respect of any undrawn commitment in respect of a revolving credit facility and except to the
extent such transaction is subsequently abandoned); provided, that the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer (and
any other financial term derived therefrom), other than for purposes of calculating any baskets, ratios or
permissions in connection with the specified transaction, shall not include any Consolidated Net Income of or
attributable to a target company until the closing of such transaction shall have actually occurred.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if (x) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a_
portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket
and (y) at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based basket, unless otherwise elected by
the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to
such ratio-based basket.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by Holdco (only with respect to the covenants under the headings “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interests” and “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”),_

214


-----

the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee or the
Holders (with a copy to the Trustee if given by the Holders) of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
**acceleration provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to EUR
25.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Holdco, the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer or Holdco), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of EUR 25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts
for which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
**provision”);**

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair market
value in excess of EUR 10.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations
under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or
the Issuer, Holdco or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is
invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer
(with a copy to the Trustee if given by the Holders) in writing of the default and, with respect to clauses (4) and
(6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) or (6), as applicable, of this
paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee, by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
under the Indenture, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under
the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an
Event of Default described in clause (4) under the definition of “—Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or

215


-----

payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment
of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the
Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except
as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to
the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with
respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to
the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, cost or expense. Except
to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in
writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to
the Trustee against any loss, liability, cost or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and
the offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee
or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the
degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse
to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial
to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that
the Trustee has no duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action
under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or other security satisfactory to it in its
sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the
occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with
the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice
in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give written notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,

216


-----

written notice in the form of an Officer’s Certificate of any events of which it is aware which would constitute
certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant
to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required
by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed
period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take
certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity and/or security to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying with
its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event
of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); _provided that if any amendment, supplement,_
other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive one series of the Notes, only the consent of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes
affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder (or, if any
amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, supplement, modify or waive one series of the Notes,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of
such series of Notes affected, with respect to any such series of Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may
be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to
such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

217


-----

(9) waive a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of_
the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect
thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or
amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security
interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”
is complied with;

(10) to make any changes or amendments to the Notes Documents necessary or advisable to effect a Permitted
Parent Reorganization in respect of the Shareholder Distribution and any other amendments as described
under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Amendments to the
_Intercreditor Agreement Following the Issue Date” in this Offering Memorandum; or_

218


-----

(11) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely conclusively on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the
Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any
Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to
any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of any series of Notes
have taken action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes will be deemed to
be the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes as of (i) the record date in respect of such
action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action) or (ii) the date the taking of such
action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Notes has been certified to the Trustee by
the Issuer (if no such record date has been set).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clause (3) or (6) of the second preceding paragraph to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be
necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly
authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other
amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled
by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be
outstanding; provided that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes of a series,
any Note Guarantees and the Indenture with respect to the Holders of such series in their capacity as such (“legal
**defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default with respect to such series, except for**
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities
and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes of such series, registration of Notes of such series, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes of such series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents
and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate with respect to the Notes of the applicable series (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of the Issuer, Holdco and any future Guarantors under the
covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such_
covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default,
the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any Significant Subsidiaries, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—Events
_of Default” (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to a series of Notes,
payment of such Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Notes, payment of such Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and
(2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4),
(5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee or Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and

219


-----

reasonably acceptable to the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
applicable series of Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling received by the Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or based on a
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes and the rights of the Trustee, as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated
and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying
Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or
appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee for this purpose), cash in euro or
euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent
for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have
become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid
or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee (or as applicable, the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or
appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee for this purpose)) under the Indenture to apply
the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be
(subject to the next succeeding sentence) and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be an employee of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries)
each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel
may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested by the Issuer in writing to the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent (which
request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s
Certificate) no later than five business days prior to such distribution, the Trustee or Paying Agent (or such other
entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, acting for the
Trustee for this purpose) shall distribute any amount deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity
or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders
prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break cost or any additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a
global note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding
interests as a participant of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing

220


-----

system. No Trustee, Paying Agent or other applicable party shall be required to incur any costs, fees or expenses
(except as expressly agreed in writing) in relation to such distribution.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, Holdco or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, of which the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use
the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer,
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes
incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become
effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or expenses
Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summons and other communications to the Holders of the Notes from the Trustee shall be sent
via Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) with a copy to the Issuer and the Authority (if the Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Exchange and to the extent required by the rules of the Authority). Any such notice or
communication shall be deemed to be given or made when sent from Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable).
The Issuer’s written notifications to the Holders of Notes shall be sent through Euroclear or Clearstream (as
applicable) with a copy to the Trustee and the Authority (if the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and to the extent required by the rules of the Authority).

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of EUR-Denominated Restrictions**

The EUR is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees including damages. Any amount received or
recovered in a currency other than EUR (in the case of the Notes), whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a

221


-----

judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or
otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the EUR
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is practicable to do so).

If that EUR amount is less than the EUR amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee
as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision,
it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in
making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s
and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities
set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any EUR
denominated restriction herein, the EUR Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency
other than EUR shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-EUR amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (formerly The
Channel Islands Securities Exchange) (the “Exchange”) and for permission to be granted to deal in the Notes on
the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement

guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior

determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer), including in respect of
anticipated expense and cost reduction and other run rate synergies, to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee,
repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds

to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
or (ii) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the
proceeds of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain

Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be

(taking into account anticipated expense and cost reduction and other run rate synergies resulting from
such disposition, as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the
Issuer);

(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and
operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will
be excluded, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The
Notes sold to persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global
**Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the**
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in
their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, the Notes will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by
Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Book-Entry Interests for the Senior Secured Notes will be issued
only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own,
transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry
Interests will not have the Notes registered in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes in
certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” of Notes under the Indenture for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as
applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, nor any of our or their agents will
have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records, or for payments made, relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect
of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents or
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves the right
to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered
**Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.**

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.

256


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or
causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the
owner who made the initial request.

In such an event described in clauses (1) and (2), the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered
in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear,
Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not
required by the Indenture or applicable law.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent
appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the
Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the
Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss
which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture,
the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such
Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

To the extent permitted by law, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Registrar, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of
15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for
redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. The Issuer is also
not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has
tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition
Offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee and the Transfer Agent may
require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in
the Indenture. The Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted
by the Indenture and the Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their
respective nominees, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note
from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable
in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of its
Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; _provided,_ _however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be_
redeemed in part.

257


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn make
said payments to or to the order of the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear
and/or Clearstream will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective customary
procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except
as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional
_Amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under_
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts” above, the Issuer will pay additional amounts
as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of
Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner
would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent
such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices
will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agent and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agent and the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

  - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the relevant Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable clearing
system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective
agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or
expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any
such payment.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require
physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in
the relevant Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

258


-----

Through and including the 40th day after the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the issue date
of the Notes, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws
of any other jurisdiction. After the expiration of such 40-day period, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest without compliance
with these certification requirements.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such interest to persons
or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants.
Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the

259


-----

Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only
through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Exchange. The Notes have been
accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international securities
identification numbers and common code numbers for the Notes are set out under “Listing and General
_Information.” Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be_
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent,
nor any of their respective agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or
their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business
day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can
be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business. In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish
to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day,
may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is
used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**Clearing Information**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream.
The international securities identification numbers, common codes and CUSIP numbers for the Senior Secured
Notes are set out under “Listing and General Information.”

-----

**TAXATION**

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal
of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be
relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances
that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force
and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive
or retrospective effect. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should be aware that (i) the tax treatment of payments
in respect of the Notes may be different (and in some cases significantly different) from that set out below, and
(ii) tax laws and regulations and their application or interpretation by the relevant taxation authorities or courts
may change from time to time (including the flat tax regime described below which has been submitted as
unconstitutional by a fiscal court to the Federal Constitutional Court for review). Accordingly, it is not possible
to predict the precise tax treatment of the Notes which will apply to a particular investor at any given time.

**PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX**
**ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL**
**OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR CHURCH TAXES,**
**UNDER THE TAX LAWS OF GERMANY AND ANY COUNTRY OF WHICH THEY ARE RESIDENT**
**OR WHOSE TAX LAWS APPLY TO THEM FOR OTHER REASONS.**

**_Withholding Tax_**

For German tax residents (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective
management and control is located in Germany), interest payments will be subject to German withholding tax
(Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are held in custody with or administrated by (a) a German branch of a German
or non-German credit or financial services institution, (b) or a German securities institution or (c) – if no German
branch of a German or non-German credit or financial services institution or German securities institution is the
Disbursing Agent – the Issuer (each, a “Disbursing Agent,” auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate is 25%
(plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%; with respect to the
solidarity surcharge see “—Partial Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge”). For individual holders of Notes subject
to church tax, an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes applies, with the effect that
church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking
notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case
the holders will be assessed for church tax.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption
,repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,”
_Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period_
_provided that the Notes have been held in custody with or administrated by the same Disbursing Agent since the_
time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes),
the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same also applies to proceeds from the
redemption of interest coupons or collection of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing
Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding
tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless
the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the
previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a credit, financial services or security institution within the
European Union, the European Economic Area or in certain other countries/territories (e.g., the Swiss
Confederation or the Principality of Andorra). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the
actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the
disposal proceeds must, also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent generally deducts from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing
Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other capital investments with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent

261


-----

also deducts Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective
security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing
Agent credits foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by
the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the
Disbursing Agent will take up to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene
_Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross_
payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has
submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by
the competent tax authorities.

Subject to further (procedural) requirements being met, German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains
from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes (i) held (directly or indirectly via a commercial
partnership) by a corporate holder who is a German resident or (ii) forming part of a trade or business (of an
individual or a commercial partnership) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to
withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred).

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the
solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined
below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are kept or
administered in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain
circumstances. The withholding tax may be (partially) refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an
applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

Furthermore, payments made to a holder resident in a so-called “non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives
_Steuerhoheitsgebiet) may be subject to a tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a rate of 15% (plus solidarity_
surcharge) of the gross payment pursuant to the Defence against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur Abwehr von
_Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze – “StAbwG”). However,_
pursuant to recently introduced legislation, no withholding tax will be levied if bearer notes
(Inhaberschuldverschreibungen) which are represented by a global note (Sammelurkunde), are held in a collective
safe custody (Girosammelverwahrung) with a central depositary or similar instrument are tradable on a recognized
stock exchange. The exact scope of this new exemption, in particular the application to registered notes
(Namensschuldverschreinbungen), is however, unclear.

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

**_Tax Residents_**

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in
Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church
tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen).
Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance
(Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered
partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred
higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital
investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—Withholding
_Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody_
abroad or of no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the
actual gain), the individual holder must, or in case the actual gain is lower than 30% of the disposal proceeds, may
include his or her interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his or her annual tax return and will
then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further,
an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax

262


-----

rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction
of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted.

Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder
realized in the same or following assessment periods. However, if the losses result from the full or partial
non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Notes including a default of the Issuer or a (voluntary) waiver,
such losses together with other losses of such kind of the same year and loss carry forwards of previous years can
only be offset up to an amount of €20,000 per annum (“Limitation on Loss Deduction”). Any exceeding loss
amount can be carried forward and offset against future investment income, but again subject to the €20,000
limitation. Pursuant to the legislative reasoning, a non-recoverability shall also be assumed if, based on the overall
assessment of the facts and circumstances, it becomes apparent that the Issuer will not redeem the Notes in full,
_e.g., because the solvency risk has already materialized. Given that the Limitation on Loss Deduction will not be_
applied by the German Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding the Notes in custody, holders suffering losses
which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare such losses in their income tax
return.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting
and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability.
Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where
applicable, church tax). The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual
tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be
credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent
exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade
or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes
may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade
tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) applicable to the investor. If the holder is an individual or an individual partner
of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax
pursuant to a lump-sum tax credit.

**_Non-Tax Residents_**

This subsection ”—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in
Germany).

Where the Issuer makes a tax deduction from a payment to a holder of the Notes tax resident in a non-cooperative
jurisdiction under the StAbwG (as set forth under “—Withholding Tax”), such holder should in principle incur a
definitive tax charge.

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany are generally not subject to
German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including
a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder, (ii) the income otherwise
constitutes German source income (such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate)
or (iii) the holder of the Notes is tax resident in a non-cooperative jurisdiction as determined pursuant to the
StAbwG, and the above mentioned exemption (as described under “—Withholding Tax” above) does not apply.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift tax if
the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed to
be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany
at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless the Notes are attributable to a
German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has
been appointed in Germany. Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously
maintained a residence in Germany.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the issuance,
delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

263


-----

**_Partial Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge_**

The solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished as of the assessment period 2021 for certain individuals. The
solidarity surcharge shall, however, continue to apply for capital investment and, thus, on withholding taxes
levied. In case the individual income tax burden for an individual holder is lower than 25% the holder can apply
for his or her capital investment income being assessed at his or her individual tariff-based income tax rate in
which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

**Certain EU Tax Considerations**

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)_**

The European Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to
introduce a financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial
intermediary). In the course of 2020, the European Commission brought to the attention of the Council of the EU
and the EU Parliament the possibility to propose, by June 2024, the introduction of a reshaped EU FTT as a new
own recourse for the EU. However, in June 2023, the Commission stated that there is little expectation that there
will be an agreement on the FTT in the short term. Therefore, the timing of its potential introduction is still unclear.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the financial
transaction tax.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This discussion
is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations
issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as
in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion
is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below). This discussion does not address the
impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other
than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No
rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect
to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not
be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a U.S.
holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to U.S. holders subject to special rules, such as financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt
organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through
entities (or investors in such entities), U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a
jurisdiction outside the United States or are otherwise holding Notes in connection with a trade or business
conducted outside the United States (including any U.S. holders who hold the Notes through a foreign branch),
persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to
special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into
account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the
Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes
is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and do not own the Existing Notes that are being
redeemed in connection with the issuance of the Notes and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning
of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable
as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of
the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a
valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

264


-----

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in
such partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding
Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the U.S. federal
Medicare tax on net investment income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and
without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as
ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest generally will be income from sources outside
the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category
income or, in certain cases, general category income.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize interest
income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt,
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. holder will not
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize
exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise
is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to stated interest
in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each
taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating
such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect
to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s
taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to
which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent
of the IRS) to translate accrued stated interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual
period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of
receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that
uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date
such stated interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined
at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously
included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss,
generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for
foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable
limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit non-U.S. tax applies to all of the U.S. holder’s applicable
non-U.S. taxes for a particular tax year). In particular, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations may restrict the
availability of any foreign tax credit based on the nature of the withholding tax imposed by a non-U.S. jurisdiction.
The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s
particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax
credits.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will recognize gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to
accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance with the
U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.
The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of

265


-----

foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated at the spot rate on the
date of the taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and
if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement
date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the
IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to
the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or
loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S. holder. The cost
of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on
the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar
value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the
principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s
purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency
determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The aggregate exchange gain or loss with respect to
principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest (which will be treated as discussed above under
“—Payments of Stated Interest”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss recognized by the
U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as
ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. holder, any such gain
may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed
minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Modification of the Notes following an IPO_**

Upon certain circumstances, the issuer of the Notes may be modified as described in “—Description of the Notes—
_IPO Debt Pushdown” and “—Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—_
_Required Consents—Provisions Following an IPO.” Depending on the facts and circumstances at the time of such_
event, such modification may change the obligor of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes thereby
resulting in a deemed exchange of the outstanding Notes, which may be a taxable event for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the modification of a debt instrument is treated as
a “deemed exchange” of an old debt instrument for a new debt instrument upon which gain or loss is realized only
if such modification is “significant” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations. A change in obligor of the Notes
following an IPO Event may be treated as a significant modification depending on the facts and circumstances at
the time of such event. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of such an event.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions cover
transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the
Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain
circumstances, the receipt of interest or OID with respect to a Note, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Note to the extent that any such receipt, sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of an applicable threshold amount.

266


-----

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

In addition, certain U.S. holders who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in
section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in such assets (generally, on
IRS Form 8938). If a U.S. holder does not file IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties
and the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for
the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed.
These rules generally will apply to an interest in Notes, unless the Notes are held in an account with a
U.S. financial institution. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing
disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of stated interest, and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions (including retirements or
redemptions) of Notes paid to a U.S. holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is an
exempt recipient and, when required, establishes this exemption. In addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt
recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise
complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a
U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the appropriate
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a “foreign
financial institution” (as defined by FATCA, and including an intermediary through which Notes are held) may
be required to withhold U.S. tax at a rate of 30% on certain “foreign passthru payments” to persons that fail to
meet certain certification, reporting or related requirements, to the extent such payments are treated as attributable
to certain U.S. source payments. The term “foreign passthru payment” is not yet defined. Obligations issued on
or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are
filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, FATCA could
apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements
with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to
implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under
FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to
compensate for the withheld amount.

267


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition and holding of the Notes by
(a) any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of the United States Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I
of ERISA, (b) any “plan” as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code,
including individual retirement accounts and other arrangements, and (c) any entity whose underlying assets
include “plan assets” by reason of any such employee benefit plans or plan’s investment in the entity (pursuant to
Section 3(42) of ERISA and regulations promulgated under ERISA by the U.S. Department of Labor) (each of
the foregoing, an “ERISA Plan”). Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church
plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are
not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; however, such plans may be subject to
federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”). Any fiduciary of such a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan considering an investment in the Notes (together with ERISA Plans,
“Plans”) should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under such
laws or regulations.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit certain
transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA
and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an
ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered
to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in
accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the investment
prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any
other applicable Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction
**Parties”) is undertaking to act as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to acquire Notes and**
that the Transaction Parties have financial interests in the ERISA Plan’s acquisition and holding of the Notes,
which interests may conflict with the interest of the ERISA Plan. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to
provide investment recommendation or investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or
to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All
communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended
to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice
regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold
the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Such
transactions are referred to as “prohibited transactions” and include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect
extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property
between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the
benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties
and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes (or any interest
therein) by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the agents and our and
their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a

268


-----

direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption.

Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain church plans
and non-U.S. plans, which are not subject to ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may contain fiduciary
responsibility requirements substantially similar to those under Title I of ERISA and prohibited transaction
requirements substantially similar to those under Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.
Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should consider the impact of Similar
Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be acquired or held by a Plan or any person investing assets of any
Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition (or any interest therein) will not constitute a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws. Accordingly,
by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented, warranted
and agreed that either (i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds such Note or interest
therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Plan, and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser
or transferee to acquire or hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan, or (ii) the acquisition,
holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes (or an interest therein) will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, in the
case of a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, a violation of any Similar Laws.

Each purchaser and transferee of the Notes that is, or is acting on behalf of, an ERISA Plan, will be deemed to
represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties or any of their respective affiliates has
provided any investment recommendation or investment advice to it, or any fiduciary or other person investing
the assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), in connection with its decision to invest in the Notes, and they
are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of
the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Notes
and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be
construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation,
administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this
discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date
of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon
persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other
persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan,
consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any
Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit certain
transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA
and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an
ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered
to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in
accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Such
transactions are referred to as “prohibited transactions” and include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect

269


-----

extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property
between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the
benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA
Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to
which we, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the agents and our and their respective affiliates are considered a
party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in
accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain church plans
and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary responsibility and
prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and

Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should
consider the impact of Similar Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the
extent applicable.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any
Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. Accordingly, by
acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and agreed
that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the Notes or an
interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition by such purchaser or
transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be
construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation,
administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this
discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date
of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon
persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other
persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan,
consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any
Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the
Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. Each of the sales will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement
among, inter alios, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final Offering Memorandum
(the “Purchase Agreement”).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the
Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will
purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of
the final Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may change the
prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers
may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States.
The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in
whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our
counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments
of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial
Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by,
the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of
the Purchase Agreement until the date falling 60 days after the date of the final Offering Memorandum without
the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important
_Information” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

  - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances
in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

  - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done
by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, by
us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly,
and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any
applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation
would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering
Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors” and “Notice to Certain Other
_Investors.”_

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,

271


-----

contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the
safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application
has been made to list the Notes on the Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that
such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition,
any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the
U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be
liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be
favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for
_the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be        business days (as such term is used for
purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T +      ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in one business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the
following        business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their
own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of
the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a
broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering
transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining
the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition,
the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable
laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market
price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to
engage in these activities and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not
_be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date
on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued
at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no
later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 30 days after the date of the allotment
of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future
investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary
course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial

272


-----

Purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
will continue to be under the RCF Amendment and Restatement Agreement. UniCredit Bank GmbH, is acting as
Security Agent and Facility Agent for the Revolving Credit Facility and as Security Agent for the Notes. Deutsche
Trustee Company Limited is acting as Trustee for the Notes. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates
may also receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future
trading of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates have entered into supply chain
financing arrangements with the Group.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates, including,
potentially, the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hold Existing Notes, and therefore
may receive payment in connection with the redemption of the Existing Notes funded with the net proceeds of the
Offering. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, they may
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our affiliates in a manner consistent with their customary risk
management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering
into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in
our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such
securities and instruments.

Each Initial Purchaser has acknowledged that:

  - no prospectus has been filed with any securities commission or similar regulatory authority in Canada in
connection with the offer and sale of the Notes, the Notes have not been, and will not be, qualified for
sale under the securities laws of Canada or any province or territory thereof and no securities commission
or similar regulatory authority in Canada has reviewed or in any way passed upon the Offering
Memorandum or the merits of the Notes and any representation to the contrary is an offence.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that:

  - it has not offered, sold or distributed and will not offer, sell or distribute any Notes, directly or indirectly,
in Canada or to or for the benefit of any resident of Canada, other than in compliance with applicable
securities laws and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(a) any offer or sale of the Notes in Canada will be made only to purchasers that are “accredited
investors” (as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 _Prospectus_
_Exemptions_ (“NI 45-106”) or, in Ontario, as such term is defined in section 73.3(1) of the
_Securities Act (Ontario)), that are also “permitted clients” (as such term is defined in section 1.1_
of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant
_Obligations), that are purchasing as principal, or are deemed to be purchasing as principal in_
accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, and that are not a person created or used
solely to purchase or hold the Notes as an "accredited investor" as described in paragraph (m)
of the definition of "accredited investor" in section 1.1 of NI 45-106;

(b) it is either (I) appropriately registered under applicable Canadian securities laws in each relevant
province or territory to sell and deliver the Notes, (II) such sale and delivery will be made
through an affiliate of it that is so registered if the affiliate is registered in a category that permits
such sale and has agreed to make such sale and delivery in compliance with the representations,
warranties and agreements set out herein, or (III) it is relying on an exemption from the dealer
registration requirements under applicable Canadian securities laws and has complied with the
requirements of that exemption; and

(c) it has not and will not distribute or deliver any offering memorandum, or any other offering
material in connection with any offering of the Notes, in or to a resident of Canada except in
compliance with applicable Canadian securities laws.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes and the Note Guarantees offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees are subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below. By purchasing
Notes, you will be deemed to have made the following acknowledgments, representations to and agreements with
the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that:

(a) the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
any other securities laws and are being offered for resale in transactions that do not require
registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws; and

(b) unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except under
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and in each case in compliance with
the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 below.

(2) You acknowledge that this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and may not comply in important
respects with SEC rules that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering of
securities.

Issuer, that you are not acting on our behalf and that either:

(a) you are a QIB (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) and are purchasing Notes
for your own account or for the account of another QIB, and you are aware that the Initial

(4) You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers or any person
representing the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers has made any representation to you with
respect to the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Offering, other than the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum. Accordingly, you acknowledge that no representation or warranty is made by the Initial
Purchasers or any person representing the Initial Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such
materials. You represent that you are relying only on this Offering Memorandum in making your
investment decision with respect to the Notes. You agree that you have had access to such financial and
other information concerning the BestSecret Group and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in
connection with your decision to purchase Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request
information from the Group and the Initial Purchasers.

(5) You represent that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution of the Notes in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of
that investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their
ability to resell the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption from registration under
the U.S. Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which
you are purchasing Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance of the Notes will
agree, that until the end of the Resale Restriction Period (as defined below), the Notes may be offered,
sold or otherwise transferred only:

(a) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiaries thereof;

subject in each of the above cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s property
or the property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s control
and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global note, the
Resale Restriction Period (as defined below) may continue until one year after the Issuer, or any affiliate
of the Issuer, was the owner of such Note or an interest in such Global Note, and so may continue
indefinitely.

(6) You also acknowledge that:

(a) the above restrictions on resale will apply from the Issue Date until the date that is one year (in
the case of Rule 144A Notes) after the later of the Issue Date, the closing date of the issuance
of any additional Notes and the last date that we or any of our affiliates was the owner of the
Notes or any predecessor of the Notes (the “Resale Restriction Period”), and will not apply
after the Resale Restriction Period ends;

(b) if a holder of Notes proposes to resell or transfer Notes under clause (5)(e) above before the
Resale Restriction Period ends, the seller must deliver to the Issuer and the Trustee a letter from
the purchaser in the form set forth in the Indenture which must provide, among other things,

sale or other transfer of Notes under clauses (5)(c), (d) and (e) above the delivery of an opinion
of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to the Issuer, the Registrar and
the Trustee; and

(d) each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) established under the laws
of the Federal Republic of Germany. None of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ managing directors, officers and
other executives are residents or citizens of the United States. Furthermore, the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets
are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon such persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors or to enforce against them, the Issuer or
the Guarantors judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors have
appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible for investors to
effect service of process in certain jurisdictions provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and any relevant
rules of court applicable in such jurisdictions are complied with.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action
to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments,
other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given
by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive
judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action
before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of
the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the
U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

  - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

  - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely
manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such requirement, (i) the
defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the proceedings;

  - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court
or (ii) any judgment which became _res judicata_ rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in
Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict any such judgment
under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

  - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law (ordre public),
including, without limitation, fundamental rights guaranteed by virtue of the constitution of the Federal
Republic of Germany (Grundrechte).

  - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

  - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having
received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject
to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable.
Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or
moratorium laws as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful
whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely
upon U.S. federal securities laws.

German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of penal or punitive damages. Moreover, a German
court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that
they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

282


-----

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With
respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings
may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery
process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered but not recognized in Germany brings a new lawsuit
in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the
United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be
regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A
German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered
by a federal or state court of the United States (to the extent such judgment is not enforceable in Germany).

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within
Germany upon the Issuer under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents
in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such
service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated
the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the
German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held
in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive
damages. On March 2, 2022 and December 2, 2021, respectively, the United States and Germany (as a Member
State of the European Union) became signatories to the Hague Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters. Although ratified in Germany, the treaty has
not yet been ratified in the U.S. However, this may change in the future and could then impact the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in certain civil and commercial matters.

**CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES**

**AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The validity and enforceability of the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited under applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. The_
_following is a brief description of limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the_
_Collateral and of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which Note Guarantees or_
_Collateral are being provided. The descriptions below do not purport to be complete or discuss all of the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the Notes, the Note Guarantees or other security interests._
_Proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the_
_jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple_
_jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your_
_ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the security_
_interest in the Collateral. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect_
_to such limitations and considerations. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the_
_Financing,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial_
_Profile.” If additional collateral is required to be granted in the future pursuant to the Indenture, such collateral_
_will also be subject to limitations and enforceability and validity, which may differ from those discussed below._

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of member states of the European Union (“EU
**Member State”).**

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to
insolvencies which commence after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions).

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the
company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its
“center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have
differing and conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for
the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of
the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is
presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That
presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU Member State within the
three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption
of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s
central administration is located in an EU Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and
where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third
parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its
interests is located in that other EU Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into
consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are
held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the
company’s operations.

If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU
Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU Member State have jurisdiction to open main
insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency
proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the
Insolvency Regulation.

If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2)
of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction
(subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only
if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency
Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency
proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary

284


-----

proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is
defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month
period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU Member State are restricted
to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which
the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only
be opened in another EU Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency
proceedings cannot be opened in the EU Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated
under that EU Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a
creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request
the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori
_concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency_
proceedings of the debtor.

The court of an EU Member State with which a request to open main insolvency proceedings has been lodged
retains exclusive jurisdiction to open such proceedings where the center of the debtor’s main interests is moved
to another EU Member State after that request has been lodged, but before that court has delivered a decision on
it.

The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main
proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant
EU Member State so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder
appointed by a court in a EU Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers
conferred on him by the law of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such as to remove assets of
the company from that other EU Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in that other EU Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary
further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the company has assets.

The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the
commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to
facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation
with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of
companies in one or more EU Member States (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency
Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the
insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the
coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the
Issuer.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex_
_officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings_
(Antrag auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor and can
be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that, according to German case law, the debtor is unable to pay 10%
or more of its debts as and when they fall due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks.

A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values)
unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend
_wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve months (positive Fortführungsprognose)._

285


-----

A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debt when they fall due. In addition, only the debtor
can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being unable to pay its debt as and when_
they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor
to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a European
stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as a
personally liable shareholder or partner gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing
director(s) or under certain circumstances the shareholders of such company must file a petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings without undue delay; however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three weeks
after illiquidity occurred and in the case of over- indebtedness at the latest six weeks after over-indebtedness
occurred. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event
that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able_
to service its payments obligations but will presumably (predominant likelihood) not be able to continue to do so
at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, in the
case of imminent illiquidity only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings.

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung), if, in
general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turnaround plan to be implemented by way
of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that indicate that
key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent
illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren)
unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case
and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and
prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other
preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that
period of either preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung) or the preliminary
protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be
implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings
have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court
may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual
claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. Unless the debtor has applied for debtorin possession-proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary
trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency
court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The
rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary
administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the
debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision
of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the
preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called debtor-inpossession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary custodian
(vorläufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. During preliminary
insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be
appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements:

  - a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over-indebted);

  - revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the fiscal year preceding the
filing; and/or

  - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis.

The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other
group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions

taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the
following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter). The court opens_
formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not
limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at
least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the
insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the
costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will
usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is usually
appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in- possession status,
the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the
insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the
individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_
of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the
proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business- experienced and impartial.
The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the
debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the debtor. Satisfaction of these liabilities as
preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by
the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings
against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

  - Unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and
dispose of assets of the German subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

  - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by
management of a German subsidiary of the Issuer, such Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening
of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law;

  - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor
in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of
the Issuer’s, such Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form
part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening
of formal insolvency proceedings; and

  - claims against the Issuer or its German subsidiaries may generally only be pursued in accordance with
the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

  - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency
petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one
party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons
justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln)
may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the
contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law.
This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute
part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must
be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to
assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement
action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is—in principle— subject to an automatic stay once the
insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency
petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims
in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a _pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent_
sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of
their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their
security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the
sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of
insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security.

The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession
which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte)) as well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements
(Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement
proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten)
and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the
gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in
the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve
to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the
insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after
commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all
other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be
satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse).
A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can
be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to
certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules.

According to recent case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), secured creditors are
entitled to realize pledges over uncertificated shares or other rights like intellectual property on their own. That
having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) viewed in an older decision the
insolvency administrator competent to realize pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated
(verbrieft) and are hold in a custodian account (Depot) in Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in
the issued share capital of the pledged company. This decision was not explicitly set aside in the more recent
decision. However, even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described
above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its
secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after
deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain
preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their
claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary
or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the
holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The
proceeds resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient
to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Note Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after satisfaction
of such secured creditors.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however,
must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an
insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement
proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the

288


-----

insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of
creditors in accordance with specific majority rules.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the Issuer’s, any German Guarantor’s or any of their
relevant subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the
entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken
based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the Issuer, such
Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor canunder certain circumstances-be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case
may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred
to third parties, including a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. However, it will not
be possible to force a creditor into a debt-for-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it
does not consent to such swap.

Importantly, under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law
point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency
law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but
rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently a new insolvency law on group
of companies has entered into force on April 21, 2018 to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz
_zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), mainly intended to provide for a better coordination_
of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. It does not provide for a consolidation
of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of
a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key
amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings
(Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group
companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator”

(Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and
until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

**_Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and other Security_**

Any guarantee or other security granted by a German Guarantor incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited
liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or GmbH) (“GmbH”) is subject to certain provision of
the Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbHG)
(“GmbHG”).

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its
assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in
accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities
and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount
of its stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any other security
granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered
disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities
of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect
management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees
and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in
Germany in the legal form of a GmbH. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees
or security interest agree to enforce the guarantees or security interest against the German subsidiary only to the
extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s net assets falling below, or increasing an existing
shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to
certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and Guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect)
subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH (incorporated or established in Germany) will contain such

289


-----

limitation language in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or
security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all.

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder
deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations)
may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German
(direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement
process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof), inter alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract
if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only
be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out
that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German
Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the
grantor of the subsidiary guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances.
The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the
creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor
in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the_
beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close
to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law.
Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the
form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuer
to make payment on the Notes, of the subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured parties to
enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees.

Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Note Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
Issuer should, as of today, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor, the
enforcement of the Note Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded,
according to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions (höchstrichterliche
_Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice_
(Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an
affiliated company within the meaning of Section 15 AktG of such guarantor and/or security grantor (other than
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of the enforcement
of such guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing
directors pursuant to former section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG, now contained in section 15b paragraph of the
Germany Insolvency Code (Insolvenzverordnung).

The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German Guarantor
incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a general
partner (Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or
(ii) an entrepreneurs company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation
to such general partner (Komplementär).

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee
and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of
a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from
time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to
time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder
of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the
Indenture (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively
(to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations
under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the security providers under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge
the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will
discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel

290


-----

debt, a claim against the Issuer and the security providers for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no
published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under
German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such
pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition,
holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of
the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting
the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice
requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the
Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on
and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests
only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization
of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay
on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a company, which would be based on and governed by the
insolvency laws of Germany, the security interests granted as well as a guarantee provided by that entity could be
subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance
as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings, subject to specific periods. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders
of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to
challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior
to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security were avoided,
holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their
original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received by
the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security interest.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision
of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

  - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain,
security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was
illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity
(or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after
the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s
illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity
or filing);

  - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain
security (or guarantees) (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was
not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor
was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to
the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was
taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at
such time, or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such
act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that
imperatively suggested such detrimental effect);

  - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by
which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a
debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of

291


-----

such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (ii) after
the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;

  - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants
security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted or paid
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings;

  - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intent
to prejudice its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary knew
of such intention at the time of such act; in the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a
creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to four years.
“Knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew
that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the other party act
disadvantaged the other creditors. In case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to
obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the
“knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually
illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors;
The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments shall
establish the rebuttable presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

  - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded more than
two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no
knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term
“related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board,
shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor,
and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

  - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically equivalent claim if (i) in case of the
provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction,
the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or

  - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically
equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate
the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debt generally as they fell due, that a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice,
the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case
may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor,
or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction
(kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the
preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency
creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred
payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency
creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a “related
party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from
transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.

292


-----

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and
may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg).

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an
enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of
execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and
the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for
avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under
the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its
rights of avoidance in the courts.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to ensure
that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial distress to
solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European
Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and
disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency
and discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of
the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of
the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises
(Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und –restrukturierungsgesetz) (“Company Stabilization and Restructuring
**Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany.**
Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated
through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige
_des Restrukturierungsvorhabens)._

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the
occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the
debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months.
The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring
Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements
are met.

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s
liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes or the Note Guarantees), or only
selected liabilities. In addition, and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal
tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent
restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can — under certain circumstances — even be used
without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the
Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity
separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by
entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization
and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies.

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a
debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest
rates or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., are lease of)
collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister
companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved
by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes.
The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the
voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the
security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However,
if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if

-----

creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court
confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so
as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a
stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such
stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially
be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order
up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries would be the following:

  - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only
limited review or supervision by a court; restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions
for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order;

  - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the
restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral
and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security
right);

  - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring
Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

  - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the
Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any
EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being
included as a reorganized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the
restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor
on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below
the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts
if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors
from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors
due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines,
as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay
money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for restitution of a
shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan.

# Condensed notes to the consolidated interim financial statements

### 1. Company information

###### The interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended 31 March 2024 of PrestigeBidCo GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Group” or the “Best Secret Group”) were authorized by the management board by the signed financial statements dated 22 May 2024. The registered office of PrestigeBidCo GmbH (the parent) is located at Margaretha-Ley-Ring 27, Aschheim, Germany. The Company is registered with Munich Local Court (HRB 227078).

 The Group operates as a leading European members-only destination for off-price fashion with attractive discount rates represented by the online platform BestSecret.


-----

### 2. Basis of preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements

##### 2.1. General information and application of IFRS

###### The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended 31 March 2024 have been prepared based on IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The Group has prepared the financial statements on the basis that it will continue to operate as a going concern. The management considers that there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over this assumption. They have formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and not less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period.

 The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (EUR k), unless otherwise indicated. Due to rounding, it is possible that figures may not add up exactly to the total stated, and the percentages presented may not precisely reflect the figures they correspond to.


-----

##### 2.2. Amended standards and interpretations

###### The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2024. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

 Several amendments apply for the first time in 2024, but do not have an impact on the  condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group.


**Standards / Interpretations** **Impending change** **Valid / EU**
**endorsement*)**


**Anticipated effects**



- For standards and amendments to standards not yet endorsed by the EU, the date of first-time adoption scheduled by the IASB is assumed for
the time being as the likely date of first-time adoption.

### 3. Condensed notes to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income

##### 3.1. Revenue

###### Revenue is generated from the sale of merchandise. The Group’s revenue from merchandise is point in time revenue.

**Geographical markets**

Germany 184,520 159,354

International 143,532 104,185

**Total revenue from contracts with customers** **328,052** **263,539**

###### There are no contracts with customers with duration longer than one year. Consequently, no disclosure of the transaction price is necessary, since the entity elects to apply the practical expedient in IFRS 15.121(a).

 Seasonality of operations

 The Group´s business is seasonal, which is typical for retailers in the fashion industry. For example, we typically experience an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of the year due to several special sales events.

 Customer Acquisition Costs

 The Group issues vouchers in connection with the "friends recommend friends" program. According to IFRS 15, vouchers issued to existing customers for the acquisition of new customers represent consideration payable to a customer. The consideration paid to the customer for the customer referral received is a payment for a distinct service. Accordingly, the Group shall account for the procurement of the service in the same way as it accounts for purchases from its suppliers according to IFRS 15.71. The customer referral service has to be measured at fair value (or the lower transaction price). If the consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of the customer referral arrangement, the Group shall recognise the difference as a reduction of the transaction price. In case that the fair value of the referral service cannot be


-----

###### estimated reasonably, the entire consideration payable to the customer shall be recognised as a reduction in revenue.

 As from 1 January 2023 the Group is able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the referral fee. Consequently, the Group capitalizes the corresponding customer acquisition costs as costs for obtaining a contract according to IFRS 15.71 in conjunction with IFRS 15.91-15.94.

 For the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended 31 March 2024, revenue contribution was EUR 3,191k (March 31, 2023: 2,238k). This amount is reported in the cash flow statement under Cash flow from operating activities as “Other non-cash transactions“. Other intangible assets as “customer acquisition costs” and current non-financial liabilities as the corresponding “contract liability” increased by EUR 4,737k (March 31, 2023: 3,860k). The intangible asset “customer acquisition costs” is amortized over seven years reflecting the customer life cycle.

##### 3.2. Financial income


**01.01.2023 -**
**31.03.2023**


in EUR k


**01.01.2024 -**
**31.03.2024**

|Credit Interest 1,356|158|

Interest income from affiliated companies 135 223

Valuation of embedded derivatives 0 5,328

Other 1 3

**Total** **2,036** **5,712**

###### Due to the addition of the item “Credit Interest", there is a change in the prior period figures for the item “Other”. EUR 158k was reclassified from “Other” to “Credit Interest”. The decrease in credit interest income primarily results from changed market conditions compared to the prior period and is based on short-term investment transactions.

 In the three months ended 31 March 2024, no financial income is recognized for “Valuation of embedded derivatives” (prior period: financial income EUR 5,328k). For a detailed explanation, further information is provided under note 3.3. Financial expense.


-----

##### 3.3. Financial Expenses

###### Financial expenses mainly consist of costs for the Senior Secured Notes and lease liabilities.

**01.01.2024 -** **01.01.2023 -**

in EUR k **31.03.2024** **31.03.2023**

Senior Secured Notes and RCF (12,819) (9,444)

Lease liabilities (2,815) (2,160)

Interest expense on short-term liabilities (1,907) (499)

Valuation of embedded derivatives (1,635) 0

Hedge ineffectiveness interest expense (193) (186)

Other (56) (21)

**Total financial expenses** **(19,425)** **(12,310)**

###### The increase in the financial expenses is mainly due to increased costs for the Senior Secured Notes and an increase in interest expenses for current liabilities in connection with Supply Chain Financing as a result of increased volume.

 Due to the addition of the item “Interest expense on short-term liabilities", there is a change in the prior period figures for the item “Lease liabilities”. EUR 499k was reclassified from “Lease liabilities” to “Interest expense on short-term liabilities”.

 The Senior Secured Notes issued in fiscal year 2022 include an embedded derivative. As of 31 March 2024, a negative change in fair value resulted in a financial expense of EUR 1,635k (prior period: financial income EUR 5,328k), reported as “Valuation of embedded derivatives”.

##### 3.4. Taxes

###### The Group calculates the period income tax expense using the tax rate that would be applicable to the expected total annual earnings. For the three months ended 31 March 2024 and 2023, respectively, the following main items were recognized as income tax in the consolidated income statement:

in EUR k **2024** **2023**
Current income taxes (4,979) (39)

###### Management measures the performance of the segments on the basis of revenues and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income/loss for the period before interest and similar expenses, tax and depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and the reversal of impairment losses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding exceptional items and including pro forma synergies. Therefore, the reconciliation from EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA includes non-recurring, extraordinary and other non-operational items as well as run rate cost synergies from fulfillment center network expansion. The Group intends to achieve meaningful cost synergies from the expansion of its fulfillment operations. The expected cost synergies result from improved unit economics on the basis of capacity optimization (reduction of utilization rate

**Total current financial assets** **17,905** **18,828**

###### Identical to the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023, there are no receivables from subleasing with a term of more than five years.

 The financing fees (transaction costs) incurred for revolving credit facilities in the amount of EUR 1,201k are reported under financial assets as the revolving credit facility has not been drawn by the reporting date.

 Loans to affiliated companies include a loan made in amount of EUR 3,296k to PTGMidco S.à.r.l. located in Luxembourg, granted in December 2022.

 In January 2023, PrestigeBidCo GmbH entered into two hedging agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risks arising from the Senior Secured Notes. The group applies hedge accounting and recognizes the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in line item. Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.


-----

###### The agreements of the hedging instruments were conducted on 23 January 2023 and 25 January, respectively, and have both the maturity date on 15 January 2026. The total nominal value is EUR 200,000k. The hedging instruments are contracted to achieve a 1:1 hedge ratio on an economic basis to ensure an economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. For accounting purposes certain ineffectiveness may result as the derivates and the underlying are not totally consistent. The maturity date of the hedged item is on 15 July 2027. This implies that the major part of the hedged item’s duration has been hedged. Under the hedge agreements, the Group receives variable rates of EURIBOR on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 and pays fixed rates of interest of 3.066% and 3.089%, respectively, on the same periods.

 The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.

###### The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, financial assets (current and non-current), bank balances and cash as well as trade and other payables and financial liabilities (current) equal their fair values, as they are mainly short term.

 Other financial liabilities mainly contain liabilities from supply chain financing and refund liabilities.

 The change in lease liabilities compared to the prior year mainly results from new leasing agreements in connection with the fulfillment center network expansion. This also lead to an increase in right of use assets of an amount of EUR 12,160k.

 The fair value of the interest bearing loans and borrowings (Senior Secured Notes) and the derivative financial instrument are disclosed separately in the table below.

 The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair values. Financial instruments with fair value measurement based on quoted prices in active markets are disclosed in Level 1. In Level 2, determination of fair values is based on observable inputs, e.g., foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Level 3 comprises financial instruments for which the fair value measurement is based on unobservable inputs.

Interest accrues at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the sum of the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) (which is subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 6.0%. Interest payment dates are quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. On June 6, 2023, PrestigeBidCo GmbH successfully agreed with investors to issue an additional EUR 50,000k through a private placement, thereby increasing the already existing Senior Secured Notes in the amount of EUR 350,000k to a total volume of EUR 400,000k. The private placement had an issue price of 99% with an initial interest rate of 9.177% (EURIBOR plus 6% margin).

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

### 1. Company information

###### The consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2023 of PrestigeBidCo GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Group” or the “BestSecret Group”) were authorized by the Management Board by the signed financial statements dated 8 March 2024. The registered office of PrestigeBidCo GmbH (the parent) is located at Margaretha- Ley-Ring 27, Aschheim, Germany. The Company is registered with Munich Local Court (HRB 227078).

 PrestigeBidCo GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Secret Group SE (former Best Secret Group AG). PrestigeBidCo GmbH publishes consolidated financial statements in accordance with Sec. 291 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and voluntarily in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).


-----

### 2. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements

##### 2.1. General information and application of IFRS

###### The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted in the European Union (EU). A Group management report and the obligatory disclosures to be made under German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB were added to the consolidated financial statements.

 To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of comprehensive income have been aggregated. These items are shown and explained separately in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 The presentation and the components of the consolidated financial statements comply with the rules in IAS 1.10. The consolidated statement of comprehensive income is prepared based on the function of expense method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared based on IAS 7.

 With the exception of certain items, which are measured at fair value (See 2.17.), the consolidated financial statements are prepared mainly based on historical costs on the reporting date, 31 December 2023. Historical costs are generally based on the fair value of the consideration transferred in exchange for the asset. The fair value is the price that would be received in orderly transactions between market participants on the measurement date for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of liabilities. This applies regardless of whether the price can be directly observed or is estimated using a measurement method.

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (EUR k), unless otherwise indicated. Due to rounding, it is possible that figures may not add up exactly to the total stated, and the percentages presented may not precisely reflect the figures they correspond to.

 The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year. The fiscal year of the consolidated entities also corresponds to the calendar year.

 The management prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.


-----

##### 2.2. Amended standards and interpretations

###### 2.2.1 New or amended IFRS applied in the fiscal year

 The Group applied all standards and interpretations (including amendments) as adopted by the EU in its consolidated financial statements which are mandatory for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2023.

 Amendments to standards that were mandatory from 1 January 2023 relate to amendments to IAS 1 (Clarifications to Accounting Policies), IAS 8 (Accounting Estimates), IAS 12 (Income Taxes - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a single transaction and Amendment for IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules) as well as IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts).

 The Group capitalizes customer acquisition costs beginning on 1 January 2023. For more information on customer acqusition costs, see note 2.4.11 and 4.1..

 The presentation of liabilities from supply chain financing has been changed in the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, in order to provide better and more reliable information. Previously, these liabilities were reported under "Trade and other payables". For further detail, refer to note 2.4.12 and 5.14..

 Application of the amendments did not have any effect on the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023.

 2.2.2 New or amended IFRS not yet applied

 The following accounting standards relevant for the Group had already been issued by the IASB before the consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue, but their adoption is not yet mandatory and they have not yet been adopted by the Group and do not have any material impact on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position and performance.

##### 2.3. Principles of consolidation

###### 2.3.1 Basis of consolidation and group information

 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as of 31 December 2023. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those


-----

###### returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, it has:

 • Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)

 • Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee

 • The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

 Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

 • The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee

 • Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

 • The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

 The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

 As a general rule, subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements by way of full consolidation from the time when the Group obtained control over or the ability to control the subsidiary. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other


-----

###### components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.

 The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the parent company PrestigeBidCo GmbH and its fully consolidated subsidiaries summarized in the following table:

**Shareholding in %**

**Company name** **Location** **31 Dec 2023**

PrestigeBidCo GmbH (Germany) Aschheim

**Best Secret S.r.l. (Italy)** **Milano** 100

###### In the context of the Group’s continued growth and internationalization Best Secret S.r.l. was established on 27 July 2023. The entity will mainly provide technical and commercial support services in the textile and fashion retail sector, in particular purchasing activities.

 Swiss Online Shopping AG i.L. is in liquidation.

##### The holding company

###### The next-senior holding company of PrestigeBidCo GmbH is Best Secret Group SE (Aschheim).  The consolidated financial statements of Best Secret Group SE (smallest and largest consolidated group) are published in the electronic German Federal Gazette (“Bundesanzeiger”). The ultimate holding company of Best Secret Group SE is Permira Holdings Limited (St. Peter Port, Guernsey).

 2.3.2 Consolidation methods

 Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the acquisition costs against the Group share of the fair value of the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries at the time of acquisition. At this juncture, the acquisition method is used. Receivables and corresponding liabilities of Group entities were offset against each other. Significant intercompany results from intra-Group service transactions were eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Sales and other income


-----

###### from intra-Group supply and service relationships were offset against the corresponding expenses. The financial statements of all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared as of 31 December 2023.

##### 2.4. Use of estimates and assumptions

###### The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that have effects on the amounts carried and the related disclosures. Although these estimates are based on the current events and measures to the best of management’s knowledge, there may be deviations between estimated and actual results. Significant estimates and assumptions have been used for the following matters in particular:

 • Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts)

 • Determination and assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes

 • Assumptions for the calculation of returns and unredeemed coupons

 • Inventory valuation

 • Segment reporting

 • Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables

 • Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16

 • Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16

 • Assumptions with regards to notes measurement including separation of embedded derivatives

 • Assumptions with regards to fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments

 • Customer acquisition costs


-----

###### • Presentation of amounts related to supply chain financing

 • Factoring agreements

 These key forward-looking assumptions and estimates, which involve a significant risk of changing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year, are discussed below.

 2.4.1 Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and the war in Ukraine)

 All non-financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are tested for impairment if there are indicators that the asset may be impaired. Regardless of indicators of impairment, goodwill acquired in business combinations is tested for impairment once a year at the level of the cash- generating unit to which the asset belongs.

 This assessment implies significant judgment and estimates, in particular in light of the uncertainties in connection with the ongoing war in Ukraine. The ongoing war in Ukraine has been a source of continuous disruptions in global supply chains, leading to inflationary pressures on the supply, shipping, and fulfillment processes of the online market business in general. This was taken into account during the impairment testing for goodwill and the review of useful lives for the intangible assets recognized by using the purchase method in compliance with IFRS 3. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. This is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model that is the basis for the calculation of the value in use used as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant to goodwill. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 5.1.

 2.4.2 Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes

 Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for prior years. Various factors such as past experience with tax field audits and different treatment of tax regulations by tax authorities are considered.

 Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profit. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainty. Consequently, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of


-----

###### deferred tax assets recognized at the reporting date. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the income statement.

 2.4.3 Calculation of returns and unredeemed gift vouchers

 Returns

 For transactions with a statutory 14-day or longer refund policy, the Group calculates the amount of the expected returns as of the reporting date based on historical return rates under consideration of the actual returns until the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements, which are taken into account in order to reduce revenue. As of 31 December 2023, deferred revenues amounted to EUR 49,005k (prior year: EUR 37,952k). The right to recover possession of expected returns is reported under other current non-financial assets.

 Unredeemed gift vouchers

 The acquiring customer has a claim from the sale of vouchers for fulfillment up to a period of three years. If vouchers sold are not redeemed within this period, the Group realizes the revenue from the voucher sale. Liabilities from the sale of gift vouchers are recognized under other liabilities and amounted as of 31 December 2023 to EUR 1,617k (prior year: EUR 2,036k).

 2.4.4 Inventory valuation

 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary costs to make the sale. Estimates are necessary to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. Further details are given in note 5.6.

 2.4.5 Segment reporting

 IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) of the Group for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the respective segments. Since fiscal year 2021, the Group segments are “Germany” and “International”. Primary emphasis is placed on the key performance indicators, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The group defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA


-----

###### excluding exceptional items and including pro forma synergies. Therefore, the reconciliation from EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA includes non-recurring, extraordinary and other non-operational items as well as run rate cost synergies from the fulfillment center network expansion (calculated as percentage of revenue). The recognition and measurement methods of the reportable segments correspond to the consolidated recognition and measurement methods described in note 6.3.

 2.4.6 Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables

 The determination of the necessity and amount of valuation allowances on receivables requires assumptions and estimates regarding the credit risk and underlying time intervals. In the case of a return debit, the Company informs the customer and defines a period for payment. When the defined time period has elapsed, written warnings are sent to the customers. Further details are given in note 5.7. and note 5.17.

 The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due and the Group’s historical default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on expectations as to the collectability of the receivables.

 2.4.7 Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16

 The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering the debt structure of the Group and the useful life of the leased assets. To measure lease liabilities the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group estimates the incremental borrowing rate by using observable input factors.

 2.4.8 Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16

 The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering the overall business development as well as the term of existing leases.

 2.4.9 Assumptions with regards to notes measurement including separation of embedded derivatives

 The embedded redemption option for the note issued in 2022 is considered to be not closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9, neither the option’s exercise price is equal to the


-----

###### carrying amount of the host contract on each exercise date, nor the lender is reimbursed for an amount up to the present value of lost interest for the remaining term of the host contract. Since both, the prepayment option and the interest rate floor relate to the interest risk, both derivatives are treated as a single compound embedded derivative.

 The methodology used to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives is based on the approach of a Monte Carlo simulation. The refinancing rate is divided into a risk-free component and a credit risk component in the form of a credit spread. The simulation of the risk-free rate is based on a Hull/White 1-factor model and the simulation of the credit spread is based on a standard Wiener process. The optimal trade-off is determined on the basis of the Longstaff/ Schwartz approach. The starting point for the floor component is the simulated risk-free interest rates. Based on the simulated interest rates, floorlets are formed for each individual quarter during the term of the notes, which are then valued using the Black76 approach. The floorlet component is valued taking into account any exercise of the call option during the simulation.

 2.4.10 Assumptions with regards to fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments

 The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Estimates of future floating-rate cash flows are based on quoted swap rates, futures prices and interbank borrowing rates. Estimated cash flows are discounted using a yield curve constructed for hypothetical zero coupon bonds due on the date of each future net settlement of the swap. The fair value estimate is subject to a credit risk adjustment that reflects the credit risk of the Group and of the counterparty, this is calculated based on credit spreads derived from current credit default swap or bond prices.

 2.4.11 Customer acquisition costs

 The Group issues vouchers in connection with the "friends recommend friends" program. For the fair value estimation of the customer referral service, the group implements a portfolio-based derivation as an average value of the commission payments actually made (i.e. taking into account the actual redemption rates of the vouchers). By applying the portfolio approach, an estimated value is determined, that has been raised on the basis of a large population. Due to the fact that management performs very detailed customer-related evaluations of the consideration paid, it can be assumed that this is an appropriate consideration for the customer referral services received.


-----

###### The Group capitalizes customer acquisition costs beginning on 1 January 2023 since a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the referral fee was not possible before, for further details see note  4.1.

 2.4.12 Presentation of amounts related to supply chain financing

 The Group uses reverse factoring to enable efficient payment processing of supplier invoices which result in derecognition of the original trade payables as a debt-discharging payment is made by the financing partner to settle the corresponding trade payables. As a discretionary management decision in respect of supply chain financing, the liabilities covered by the reverse factoring program are considered to be a component of working capital and the payments to the factoring service provider continue to be included in cash flows from operating activities because they remain part of the Group’s normal operating cycle and their key character remains operational, i.e., indirect payments for the purchase of goods and services. Payment terms under this program are modified to an extent customary in the retail industry. The liabilities to the factor are recognized under other current financial liabilities (see note 5.14.), the interest expenses on the liabilities under financial expenses (see note 4.5.)

 2.4.13 Factoring agreements

 The Group engages in factoring and regularly sells receivables to third parties. The contractual rights to receive the cashflow of the financial assets are transferred to the factor. In accordance with IFRS 9, receivables are derecognized because the Group loses control over the receivables.  The derecognized receivables are no longer reported in the Group’s balance sheet.

##### 2.5. Business combinations and goodwill

###### Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquire at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

 When the Group acquirees a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date.


-----

###### Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

 After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. In case of any structural changes of the respective CGUs within the Group, an impairment review and potential reallocation of the Goodwill according to IAS 36 is performed. More detailed information on impairment testing can be found in note 5.1.

##### 2.6. Current and non-current portions

###### The Group classifies its assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position as current and non-current assets or liabilities.

 An asset is classified as current when:

 • it is expected to be realized, or intended to be sold or consumed, within the normal operating cycle,

 • it is expected to be realized within 12 months after the reporting period or

 • it is cash or a cash equivalent, unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for a period of at least 12 months.

 All other assets are classified as non-current.

 A liability is classified as current if:

 • it is expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle,

 • it is expected to be realized within 12 months of the end of the reporting period or

 • the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

 All other liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current assets or liabilities.


-----

##### 2.7. Fair value measurement

###### The Group applies measurement techniques that are appropriate under the respective circumstances and for which sufficient data is available for fair value measurement. In the process, observable market inputs are to be preferred to non-observable inputs.

 Assets and liabilities measured or presented at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are classified on the basis of the following fair value hierarchy. The classification uses the input parameters of the lowest category that is material to the fair value measurement.

 • Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

 • Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly

 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the assets and liabilities

##### 2.8. Revenue recognition

###### The Group recognizes revenue according to IFRS 15 at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods to the customers, net of taxes and duties, and taking into account agreed payment terms. Revenue is reported net of discounts, rebates, taxes and returns. Since the Group has price discretion in its sales transactions and also bears the inventory and credit risk, the Group generally acts as a principal and is therefore the principal party of all sales transactions.

 In addition, the Group purchases some products, such as jewelry, on a commission basis. In this case, the Group is acting as an agent, but is free in the setting of prices. Moreover, the Group enables selected partners to sell goods directly to BestSecret’s closed customer community over its Curated Platform. In both cases, revenue is earned in the amount of the commission received. The amount remains immaterial for 2023.

 Revenue recognition requires the fulfillment of the following recognition criteria:

##### Sale of goods and products

###### The Group’s contracts with customers for the sale of merchandise generally include a single performance obligation. The Group has concluded that revenue from the sale of merchandise should be recognized at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the


-----

###### customer. In the stationary retail business, revenue is therefore recognized upon handing over the goods and in online trading upon delivery of the goods to the customer.

 The Group enables selected partners to sell goods directly to BestSecret's closed customer community over its Curated Platform. The revenue is recognized in the amount of the commissions expected to be received from partners as the group acts as agent.

##### Accounting treatment of returns in the online business

###### Under IFRS 15, the consideration received from the customer is variable because the contract allows the customer to return the products. The Group uses the expected value method to estimate the merchandise that will be returned, because this method predicts most accurately the amount of variable consideration to which the Group will be entitled. The Group applies the requirements in IFRS 15 on constraining estimates of variable consideration such as return rate to determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. The Group presents a refund liability (other current financial liabilities) and an asset (other current non- financial assets) for the right to recover possession of goods from a customer separately in the statement of financial position, taking into account the costs incurred for processing the return and the losses resulting from disposing of these goods. The Group presents the expected returns of goods on a gross basis in the statement of comprehensive income and reduces revenue by the full amount of sales that it estimates to be returned. The dispatch of goods that is recorded in full when they are shipped is then corrected by the estimated value of the returns. Generally, the Group allows goods to be returned within a period of 14 days of receipt. Longer periods may be agreed upon contractually.

##### Friends recommend friends – customer acquisition program

###### The Group has implemented a recommendation program for customers. The first time the invitee (recommended customer) places an order and does not return it in full, the inviting customer (inviter) receives a one-time commission voucher of 10% to 20%. The inviter also receives a 5% to 7% voucher based on the total purchases of the invitee within a period of 12 months. According to IFRS 15, both vouchers represent payments to the inviting customer under IFRS 15 as costs to initiate a contract with a new customer (invitee). The purchase of the service is to be accounted for in the same way as purchases from suppliers (IFRS 15.71). The customer referral service is to be measured at fair value (or the lower transaction price). If the consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of the customer referral service, the difference is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price. In the event that the fair value of the customer referral service cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability, the entire consideration payable to the customer is to be recognized as a reduction of revenue.


-----

##### 2.9. Taxes

 Current income taxes

###### Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

 For the purpose of measuring current German taxes, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15% is applied to distributed and retained earnings and a solidarity surcharge rate of 5.5% is applied to that amount. That yields a tax rate of 15.83%. In addition, German trade tax is imposed on profits earned in Germany. The trade tax is based on the assessment rates of the various municipalities and the basic federal rate, which has been a flat rate of 3.5% according to Sec. 11 (2) GewStG (“Gewerbesteuergesetz”: German Trade Tax Act) since the corporate tax reform in 2008. The trade tax varies depending on the different assessment rates of the municipalities, but a flat rate of 11.38% is applied in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

 The profits earned by the non-German Group companies are calculated on the basis of the national tax laws applicable in each country and taxed at the tax rates in effect in those countries. The country- specific tax rates range from 19% to 28%. The Group tax rate is 27.21% (2022: 27.12%). Current tax expenses are calculated on the basis of the taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs from the net profit presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a result of the expenses and income that will not be taxable or that become tax-exempt in later years. The Group’s liability for current taxes is calculated on the basis of the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted in the near future.

##### Deferred taxes

###### Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

 Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:


-----

###### • Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 • In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

 The initial recognition exemption to leases is not applied, IAS 12 amendments on deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction have no effect on the financial statement.

 The Amendments to IAS 12 "International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules" with their publication on May 23, 2023 provide for a temporary exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes for the top-up tax, which are in principle applicable retrospectively for the prior fiscal year as a result of the adoption by the EU on November 8, 2023. The Group is affected by the scope of the OECD rules on international minimum taxation (Pillar Two), which are effective from January 1, 2024 and may increase income tax expenses in future. Tax effects that may result from the future application of the rules on global minimum taxation are not taken into account in determining deferred taxes.

 Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:

 • Where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the pre-tax accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 • In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

 The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized


-----

###### deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the end of the reporting period.

 Deferred income tax relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and not in the profit or loss.

 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

 Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in profit or loss.

##### Value added tax

###### Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of value added tax (VAT) except:

 • If VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case VAT is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as applicable; and

 • Where receivables, payables and finance lease liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

 The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

##### 2.10. Foreign currencies

###### Generally, foreign currency transactions in the single-entity financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries included in the basis of consolidation are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Therefore, foreign currency monetary items are recognized at the closing date in the balance sheet. The differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss.

 Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

 Thus, in the event of a discrepancy between the local and functional currency, financial statements of subsidiaries and associates in currencies outside the eurozone are translated using the functional currency method.

##### Foreign currency transactions and balances

###### Generally, foreign currency transactions in the single-entity financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Therefore, foreign currency monetary items are recognized at the closing date in the balance sheet. The differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss.

 Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

 Thus, in the event of a discrepancy between the local and functional currency, financial statements of subsidiaries and associates in currencies outside the eurozone are translated using the functional currency method.

##### Foreign operations

###### The Group has analyzed the Group companies and concluded that for each company the currency of origin represents the functional currency. During consolidation, all assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the closing rate. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the respective reporting date, while equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognized in

##### 2.11. Intangible assets

###### Intangible assets acquired in the context of a business combination under IFRS 3 are recognized separately from goodwill and measured at fair value at the acquisition date. This includes customer bases and brand names. These are recognized as an intangible asset according to IAS 38, measured at fair value and amortized over their expected useful lives.

 An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.

 Intangible assets which are not acquired as part of a business combination but as purchased licenses are initially recognized at cost.

 Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful life. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indications of impairment at the reporting date. The remaining useful life and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of a reporting period. If the reasons for impairment have been eliminated, a reversal to a maximum of the historical cost is set as the upper limit. Required changes in the amortization period and method are treated as changes in estimates. Impairment losses on intangible assets, e.g., customer base and brand names, with finite useful lives are included in amortization within selling expenses.

*The total useful life of the customer base “Schustermann & Borenstein” was reduced from 20 years to 14 years. Reviewing the useful lives at the
end of 2021 showed the need for prospective alignment of the remaining useful life of the respective customer bases to 3 years from the 2022
reporting period onwards. This reduces the total useful life for the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base accordingly to 8 years.

###### In the case of internally generated intangible assets, IAS 38 makes a distinction between the research phase and the development phase. Costs incurred during the research phase cannot be capitalized; instead they must be recognized as an expense. Though, development costs are capitalized, if the development costs can be reliably measured, the product or process is technically and commercially appropriate, a future commercial benefit is probable, and the Group intends and has adequate resources to complete the development and use or sell the asset. The Group primarily develops key components of software (BestSecret website and the BestSecret app as well as expenses for the Group’s other IT-systems and infrastructure) used by the Group. A useful life of 4 to 5 years is assumed for development activities in connection with the software.

##### 2.12. Property, plant and equipment

###### Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost and depreciated in accordance with their expected useful life using the straight-line method. The Group treats changes in the residual values or useful lives that arise during use as a change in estimates. Depreciation is charged over the following useful lives.

**Total useful life in years**

Land, property rights and buildings including buildings on third-party land 5-20

Plant and machinery 11-13

Other equipment 3-23

###### An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.

 The residual values, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. If the carrying amount of a tangible asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized, in addition to systematic depreciation, in order to lower the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (net selling price) and the present value of the net cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset. Whenever possible, the net selling price is derived from the most recently observed market transactions.


-----

##### 2.13. Inventories

###### Merchandise accounted for as inventories is recognized at cost pursuant to IAS 2. Cost is calculated on the basis of an item-by-item measurement, factoring in the additions from the point of view of the sourcing market or on the basis of the moving average price of the goods. Incidental acquisition costs are generally measured on a monthly basis. Supplier payments that are to be classified as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of inventories. Consumption of inventories is recognized within the cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.

 Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The net realizable value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. Adequate write-downs to net realizable value were made to consider all risks due to slow-moving goods and/or reduced salability. When the circumstances that previously caused merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist, the write-down is reversed.

##### 2.14. Impairment of non-financial assets

###### The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset reported in the statement of financial position may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing is required, the Group carries out an impairment test. Further details are given in note 5.1.

##### 2.15. Cash and cash equivalents

###### Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. The “Cash and cash equivalents” item in the consolidated statement of financial position comprises cash, bank balances and credit balances with Payment Service Providers with a banking license (cash in transit). Credit balances with Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license are reported as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the consolidated statement of financial position. The cash in transit balances are presented as cash equivalents as these balances are immediately credited to the bank account with the payment service providers over which the company has direct power of disposal.

 For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the cash and cash equivalents defined above are presented less overdraft facilities that have been drawn, as these are an integral part of the Group’s available cash.


-----

##### 2.16. Leases

 The Group as a lessee

###### The Group leases various properties, equipment and vehicles. Leases are typically entered into for periods of 2 to 20 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

 Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is broken down into an interest component and a principal repayment. Interest is recognized in the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for the reporting period (effective interest method). It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

 The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. When the term of the lease liability is reassessed, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

 Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

 • fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable

 • lease payments covering renewal periods considered in the determination of the lease term

 • variable lease payments that are based on an index or an (interest) rate to the extent that a change in the index or rate has actually triggered a change in the lease payments

 • amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees

 • the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and


-----

###### • payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

 The lease payments are discounted using the the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

 Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

 • the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability

 • any lease payments made at or before the commencement date

 • any initial direct costs, and

 • restoration costs.

 Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low- value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.

##### The Group as lessor

###### The Group sub-lets office and retail space.

 When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

 In case of finance leases, rental income is recognized using the effective interest method over the term of the subleases and reported in interest income. Payments received from operating subleases are recognized within other operating income.

##### 2.17. Financial instruments

###### Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.


-----

##### Financial assets

###### Financial assets (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) are measured at fair value on initial recognition plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The fair values recognized in the balance sheet generally correspond to the market prices of the financial assets and liabilities. If these are not directly available, they are calculated using recognized valuation models and current market parameters. Trade receivables without a significant financing component are initially measured at transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15.

 On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at: Amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) – debt investment, FVOCI – equity  investment or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The Group assesses the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at portfolio level.

 For the "held to collect" business model and the "held to collect and to sell" business model, the prerequisite is that the cash flows of the financial instrument consist exclusively of interest payments and repayments (Solely Payment of Principal and Interest - SPPI). Instruments that meet the SPPI test must be measured at amortized cost in the "held to collect" business model and at FVOCI in the "held to collect and to sell" business model, subject to the continued possibility of exercising the fair value option under certain conditions. Financial instruments that do not pass the SPPI test must be classified and measured at FVTPL under the "Held for trading" business model. No financial assets are allocated to the category “held to collect and sell” in financial year 2023.

 Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is usually the original invoice value less a loss allowance for expected impairment losses. The loss allowance for trade receivables is determined based on lifetime expected credit losses, which are calculated as the present value of expected cash shortfalls. Changes are recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For its online customers, the Group offers the option to purchase on account. In connection with this payment option, the Group works with a factoring provider, transferring substantially all risks and rewards resulting from the receivables to the factoring company and derecognizing receivables in the statement of financial position. Credit balances with Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license are reported as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the consolidated statement of financial position.


-----

###### Within the senior secured notes, the Group identified an embedded derivative, which is recognized separately and measured at fair value through profit or loss. The embedded redemption option for the note is considered to be not closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. The redemption option and the interest rate floor of the host contract are treated as a single compound embedded derivative, see note 2.4.10.

 Other financial assets are classified as “at amortized cost”, see note 5.5.

 Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount, are measured “at amortized cost”. A gain or loss on such an instrument subsequently measured at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is sold or impaired. Interest income from this type of financial asset is included in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.

 Credit risks related to debt instruments at amortized cost held by the Group at the reporting date are considered to be low. Therefore, the regular approach in accordance with IFRS 9 requires the Group to determine, at inception as well as on an ongoing basis during the lifetime of the debt instrument, the allowance as the credit losses expected in the next 12 months. If the credit risk were to increase and no longer be regarded as low-risk, lifetime expected credit losses would have to be recognized. The Group considers credit risk as significantly increased if debt instruments are past due for more than 30 days. For trade receivables, a separate approach is applied for measuring impairment, see note 5.7. and 5.17.

 Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets.

##### Financial liabilities

###### Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the duration of the obligation using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount upon initial recognition.


-----

###### Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade and other payables and other liabilities, are measured at amortized cost, see note 5.12. and 5.17. Trade and other payables are amounts owed as consideration for goods or services provided to the Group in the normal course of business including amounts owed to a payment service provider governing the settlement of supplier liabilities. In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are therefore classified as current; otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities, see note 5.14. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or nominal value.

 The Group derecognizes a financial liability when the related obligation has been paid, canceled or has expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized financial liability and the consideration received or due is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

##### Derivative financial instruments

###### The Group uses derivative financial instruments only for hedging purposes in order to reduce interest rate risks from the senior secured notes. Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted separately as derivatives, see note 5.17.

 Derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet on the trade date and are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss or under certain criteria with no effect on income. Positive fair values lead to the recognition of a financial asset, negative fair values to the recognition of a financial liability.

 The Group applies cash flow hedges as of the reporting date.

 When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognized in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss.


-----

###### i

##### 2.18. Provisions

###### Provisions are recognized in accordance with IAS 37 when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

 A best estimate is made of the amount of the provisions, taking into consideration all the discernible risks arising from the obligation. This refers to the amount that is most likely needed to settle the liability. Provisions with a residual term of more than one year are discounted on the reporting date.

##### 2.19. Share-based payment

###### Certain executives and executive management (managers) were given the opportunity to invest in different German limited partnerships, which indirectly own interests of approximately 5% in the Group. The subscription price for the partnership interests subscribed by the managers in the limited partnership corresponded to their fair value at grant date.

 The acquisition qualifies as a share-based payment under IFRS 2, and the managers’ interests in the limited partnership are recognized as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement in the financial statements. As the investments in the partnership were acquired at fair value, no expense is recognized as a result of this transaction. The participation rights in form of partnership interests were acquired from an entity outside the Group, and the Group has no obligation to make any payments on the partnership interests to the managers. The share-based payment arrangements are fully vested at grant date. The sales constitute a performance vesting condition that is considered a non-market performance condition. If the service condition is met, then the manager can exercise his or her option at the market value per share. The investment program provides for various industry-standard cancellation and settlement events. There was no change in the year 2023.


-----

### 3. Capital management

###### The Group analyses its capital based on the equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, including all components of equity as shown on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximize the value of the Group.

 It is the objective of the capital management of the Group to ensure amongst other things that it meets the financial covenants, which define leverage ratio thresholds. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the RCF banks to call any drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions. The Group monitors capital using both, a senior secured leverage ratio and an interest ratio, which is Senior Secured Net Debt*/Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA/ Interest Expense respectively as of particular effective date. The Group’s policy is to keep the leverage ratio well below the level 4,75:1 and the interest ratio above 2:1 and to reduce net debt over time. The Group achieved these targets in 2023.

 No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the reporting period ended 31 December 2023.

- Senior Secured Net Debt consists of the Senior Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility less cash and cash equivalents.

### 4. Notes to the statement of comprehensive income

##### 4.1. Revenue

###### In fiscal year 2023 the Group recognized revenue of EUR 1,225,999k (prior year: EUR 1,051,027k). The Group operates based on the internal management structure with the two segments Germany and International. The Group’s strong revenue growth was driven by a further growth in the number of active customers combined with robust order economics. The international segment was the main growth driver in revenue in 2023.

###### The amount of revenue included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year is EUR 17,723k (prior year: EUR 12,580k).

 No element of financing is deemed present as the payment of the customer is completed within several days, and satisfaction of the performance obligation is within a short period of time.

 There are no contracts with customer with a duration longer than one year. Consequently, no disclosure of the transaction price is necessary, since the entity elects to apply the practical expedient in IFRS 15.121(a).

##### Change in accounting estimate

###### The Group issues vouchers in connection with the "friends recommend friends" program. According to IFRS 15, vouchers issued to existing customers for the acquisition of new customers represent consideration payable to a customer. The consideration paid to the customer for the customer referral received is a payment for a distinct service. Accordingly, the Group shall account for the procurement of the service in the same way as it accounts for purchases from its suppliers according to IFRS 15.71. The customer referral service has to be measured at fair value (or the lower transaction price). If the consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair

###### value of the customer referral arrangement, the Group shall recognise the difference as a reduction of the transaction price. In case that the fair value of the referral service cannot be estimated reasonably, the entire consideration payable to the customer shall be recognised as a reduction in revenue. In the past, the Group was unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of the referral fee, and consequently the consideration payable to the customer was recognised as a reduction of revenue when the customer redeems it.

 As from 1 January 2023 the Group is able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the referral fee. Consequently, the Group capitalizes the corresponding customer acquisition costs as costs for obtaining a contract according to IFRS 15.71 in conjunction with IFRS 15.91-15.94.

 The change is a change in accounting estimate and shall be recorded prospectively according to IAS 8. For the consolidated financial statements for 2023 revenue contribution due to the change in accounting estimate was EUR 11,174k. This amount is reported in the cashflow statement under net cashflow from operating activities as ‘other non-cash transactions’. As a consequence of the change, other intangible assets as “customer acquisition costs” and current non-financial liabilities as the corresponding “contract liability” increased by EUR 15,758k and EUR 5,809k due to the change in accounting estimate. The intangible asset “customer acquisition costs” is amortized over seven years reflecting the customer life cycle.

 The changes in Customer Acquisition costs are described in 2.4.11.

###### Selling and distribution expenses amounted to EUR 358,958k (prior year: EUR 313,942k). These mainly contain fulfillment expenses of EUR 221,518k (prior year: EUR 188,937k), marketing expenses of EUR 21,130k (prior year: EUR 20,277k), selling expenses of EUR 37,210k (prior year: EUR 33,226k) and amortization, depreciation and impairment expenses of EUR 79,100 (prior year: EUR 71,502).

 The Group carried out development work to create software and app solutions. All non- capitalizable development costs are recognized as administrative expenses in the reporting period in which they are incurred. In 2023, this expense amounted to EUR 13,181k (prior year: EUR 16,284k).

 The state financial support related to COVID-19, in particular government-subsidized short-term work allowances, reduced personnel expenses by EUR 0k in the 2023 reporting period (prior year: EUR 37k).

 The "Other expenses" item contains shipping costs of EUR 67,273k (prior year: EUR 56,977k) as well as shipping costs for returns in the amount of EUR 29,077k (prior year: EUR 23,720k). Also included are advertising costs of EUR 21,130k (prior year: EUR 20,277k) and costs for means of payment in the amount of EUR 16,230k (prior year: EUR 14,163k). Further expenses, which are included in "Other expenses" are general administrative expenses amounting to EUR 10,250k (prior year: EUR 9,849k). Further are consulting fees of EUR 6,748k (prior year: EUR 9,774k), insurance costs for outgoing freight of EUR 3,304k (prior year: EUR 1,973k) and general administrative expenses from affiliated companies amounting to EUR 9,749k (prior year: EUR 0k)

in EUR k **Germany** **International** **Total**
Goodwill 172,956 30,592 203,548

###### Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year by comparing the carrying amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated with their recoverable amount. The value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method based on the current midterm plan for the CGU concerned.

 The major planning assumptions are:

 • Revenue/EBITDA margin

 • Discount rates

 • Growth rates used for the extrapolation of the cash flow forecasts beyond the financial planning period

###### Revenue/EBITDA margin – The budgeted revenues and earnings for each CGU are based on freely available economic and industry-specific data and take into account past trends and events alongside current market forecasts.

 Discount rates – The underlying discount rates reflect the current market forecasts with regards to the CGU-specific risks, including interest rate and asset-specific risks for which no adjustments regarding the forecast future cash flows were performed.

 The assumptions underlying the impairment test performed are stated for the CGUs Germany and International in the table below.

**Germany 2023** **International 2023**
Weighted average cost of capital after taxes 9.8 % 10.9 %

Long-term growth rate 2.0 % 3.0 %

Revenue growth Solid growth Solid growth

EBIT growth Solid growth Solid growth

**Germany 2022** **International 2022**
Weighted average cost of capital after taxes 9.1 % 10.1 %

Long-term growth rate 2.0 % 2.5 %

Revenue growth Solid growth Solid growth

EBIT growth Solid growth Solid growth

###### To conduct the impairment test, the total carrying amount of the cash-generating units is compared against the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the value in use, based on discounted future cash flows. Expected cash flows are determined based on a suitable planning process. Internal information and external macroeconomic indicators are taken into consideration. The current detailed planning period covers four years. Generally, a long-term growth rate of 2.0% to 3.0% (see table above) is applied. As a general rule, the discount factor is calculated as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) applying the capital asset pricing model. For this purpose, a peer group is used for all groups of cash-generating units operating in the same business segment. The beta factor is calculated annually based on freely available market data. For both CGUs the same beta factor was applied. A country risk premium was applied for the CGU International in addition.

 Furthermore, the discount factors are determined on the basis of the following assumptions: a base interest rate of 2.75% (prior year: 2.00%) and a market risk premium of 7.0% (prior year:


-----

###### 7.5%) as of 31 December 2023 for Germany. Country-specific risk premiums are applied to both the equity capital cost rate and the debt capital cost rate, based on the credit rating of the respective country.

 The corresponding pre-tax WACC amount to 12.8% (prior year: 11.6%) for the CGU Germany and 13.5% (prior year: 12.6%) for the CGU International.

 For the purposes of estimating the development of sustainable revenues, specific long-term growth rates were assumed in conducting the impairment test of the respective CGUs. Furthermore, customary market based EBITDA margins were assumed for calculating sustainable earnings.

 The company is not directly affected by the consequences of the war in Ukraine. There have been indirect effects, driven by the continuing inflationary pressure on supply, shipping and fulfillment in the short-term, which led to temporary negative EBITDA margin effects. These aspects were taken into account in the impairment test.

 The annual impairment test as of 31 December 2023 confirmed the recoverability of the capitalized goodwill for the CGU Germany and CGU International respectively, each with substantial headroom also after performing sensitivity analysis taking into consideration reasonably possible changes of material assumptions.

###### The Group uses a provision matrix in order to measure the expected credit losses on trade receivables from individuals, which comprise a very large number of small balances. When calculating the expected credit losses, non-representative individual cases (receivables from wholesale customers) are excluded. The impairment is calculated individually for those individual cases. The table above shows both the expected credit losses from receivables from individuals and for individual cases.

 In 2022, a new process was introduced for dunning in the receivables area. Overdue receivables are tracked more precisely and are consistently adjusted or derecognized at an earlier stage.

###### corporate and working capital purposes of the Group. As of the reporting date, EUR 12,088k (prior year: EUR 4,555k) of the total facility amount were utilized by issued guarantees and reduced the available amount.

**Total** **129,415** **57,285**

###### The Group participates in a supply chain financing arrangement in form of reverse factoring. In order to improve the informative value of the consolidated financial statements and increase comparability with other companies, the presentation of liabilities from supply chain financing has been changed in the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023. Previously, these liabilities were reported under "Trade and other payables". Due to the change in presentation in the year under review, they are now reported under "Other current financial liabilities" (refer also to note 5.14.). This does not change the nature of the liabilities as a component of (net) working capital. The change in presentation also does not result in any changes in measurement. The comparative period has been adjusted accordingly.

 For explanations on the Group’s liquidity risk management processes, refer to note 5.17.

**Total** **88,745** **46,033**

###### Due to the revenue growth, the refund liabilities increased from EUR 37,952k to EUR 49,005k at the end of financial year 2023. The largest item of other current financial liabilities is attributable to the interest rate swap in the amount of EUR 1.002k (prior year: EUR 0k).

 Presentation of liabilities from supply chain financing has been changed in the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023 and are now reported under "Other current financial liabilities". Previously, these liabilities were reported under "Trade and other payables" (refer also to note 5.13.). This does not change the nature of the liabilities as a component of (net) working capital. The change in presentation also does not result in any changes in measurement. The comparative period has been adjusted accordingly. The Group recognises cash inflow from the factor in its cash flow statement from providing the payment on behalf of the Group that equals the cash outflow. This results, due to the set-off of both cash flows, in substance in a non-cash transaction. The subsequent payment by the Group to the factor is classified as a cash outflow from operating activities.

###### Contract liabilities relate to prepayments received from customers on orders. The amount of  EUR 17,723k included in contract liabilities as at 31 December 2022 has been recognized as revenue in the reporting period 2023.

 The EUR 16,166k increase in contract liabilities is due to the increased revenue in the international market, for which the delivery of goods takes longer than the deliveries of goods within Germany. Therefore the revenue cut-off effect as of year-end has been increased.

 The presentation of “Other” has been adjusted compared to the last annual financial statements. Trade and other payables due to affiliated companies EUR 26,078k (prior year: EUR 22,221k) were reported under Other in the previous year while they are now shown as separate line item.

 Liabilities from customer referrals are liabilities for referrals arising from customer acquisition costs such as "friends recommend friends". For more information on customer acquisition costs, see note 2.4.11 and 4.1.

###### The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, financial assets (current and non-current), cash and cash equivalents as well as trade and other payables and financial liabilities (current) equal their fair values, as they are mainly short term. The fair value of the interest bearing loans and borrowings (Senior Secured Notes) are disclosed separately in the table above.

 The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair values. Financial instruments with fair value measurement based on quoted prices in active markets are disclosed in Level 1. In Level 2, determination of fair values is based on observable inputs, e.g., foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Level 3 comprises financial instruments for which the fair value measurement is based on unobservable inputs.

###### Unchanged to prior year, no financial instruments were set off and no enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements are in place as of 31 December 2023.

 The Group issued Senior Secured notes due 2027 in the amount of EUR 315,000k on 25 July 2022 and EUR 35,000k on 28 July 2022 for an issue price of 85%. Interest accrues at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the sum of the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) (which is subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 6.0%. Interest payment dates are quarterly in arrears on 15 January, 15 April, 15 July and 15 October of each year. On June 6 2023 PrestigeBidCo GmbH successfully agreed with investors to issue an additional EUR 50,000k through a private placement, thereby increasing the already existing Senior Secured notes in the amount of EUR 350,000k to a total volume of EUR 400,000k. The private placement had an issue price of 99% with an initial interest rate of 9.177% (EURIBOR plus 6% margin).

 The Group identified several embedded derivatives within the senior secured floating rate notes which are accounted as one. The embedded derivative is separated and measured at fair value through profit and loss. Details on the valuation technique and the inputs used in the fair value measurement are included in note 2.4.9.

###### The following table shows net losses from financial instruments by measurement categories:

in EUR k **31 Dec 2023** **31 Dec 2022**
Financial assets at amortized cost (trade receivables and financial assets) (145) (96)

**Financial liabilities at amortized cost** (61,680) **(38,526)**

###### Net losses in “financial assets at amortized cost” and “financial liabilities at amortized cost” mainly comprise loss allowances, foreign currency effects, credit adjustments and interest based on the effective interest method. Net losses of “financial liabilities at amortized cost” are also affected by the extent of Senior Secured Notes issued in 2023.

 Net gains in “financial assets at fair value through profit and loss” are included in note 4.6.

##### Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments

###### The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise a Senior Secured Notes as well as trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables as well as cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.

 The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Group treasury oversees these risks. The Group’s senior management is supported by group treasury with advice on financial risks for the Group. The Management Board reviews and agrees processes for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.

##### Market risk

###### Market risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.

 The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as of 31 December 2023. The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net liabilities, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the liabilities and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of provisions, the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

|in EUR k|31 Dec 2023 31 Dec 2022|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortized cost (trade receivables and financial assets)|(145) (96)|
|Financial liabilities at amortized cost|(61,680) (38,526)|


-----

###### The sensitivity analyses demonstrate how profit or loss items are affected by the assumed changes in respective market risks.

 Interest rate risk

 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. As of 31 December 2023, the Senior Secured Notes are affected by floating interest rates.

 Sensitivity of Group earnings to a change in underlying interest rates by a rise of 100 basis points and a fall of 100 basis points on variable-rate loans and borrowings as well as on the present value of derivative financial instruments and interest rate swaps are evaluated. Changes in the market interest rates of interest rate derivatives have an impact on the financial result and are therefore taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.

###### Derivatives are used to manage interest risks. In January 2023, PrestigeBidCo GmbH entered into two hedging agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risks arising from the Senior Secured Notes. The group applies hedge accounting and recognizes the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income. 

 The agreements of the hedging instruments were conducted on 23 January 2023 and 25 January 2023, respectively, and have both the maturity date on 15 January 2026. The total nominal value is EUR 200,000k. The hedging instruments are contracted to achieve a 1:1 hedge ratio on an economic basis to ensure an economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. For accounting purposes certain ineffectiveness may result as the derivatives and the underlying are not totally consistent. The maturity date of the hedged item is on 15 July 2027. This implies that the major part of the hedged item’s duration has been hedged. Under the hedge agreements, the Group receives variable rates of EURIBOR on each January 15, April 15,


-----

###### July 15 and October 15 and pays fixed rates of interest of 3.066% and 3.089%, respectively, on the same periods.

 The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. The effectiveness of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument are determined based on maturities, interest rates and nominal amounts. The hypothetical derivative method is used to check whether the designated derivatives effectively hedge the cash flows of the hedged items. In the hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are the credit risk of the counterparties and changes in the timing of the hedged highly probable future transactions.

 In the 2023 financial year, cumulative effect from cash flow hedge of EUR 1,059k (2022: EUR 0) was recognized directly in equity. A gain of EUR 193k (2022: EUR 0) from hedge accounting ineffectiveness was recognized in the result for the period, as the hedging relationship was not completely effective.

 Foreign currency risk

 Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. This year's effect from currency differences on the financial statements is mainly attributable to translation of certain lease liabilities and loans into the functional currency of the Group. The exposure of this effect on the financial statements is expected to remain at this level. Other than that, the Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant.

##### Credit risk and risk concentration

###### Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

 Concentration risks arising from the delivery of goods to major customers are subject to a special credit watch. In the case of a return debit, the Group has implemented a dunning process operated by an external service provider. The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking account of any collateral, is represented by their carrying amount. The Group offers under certain conditions purchase on account. Due to the introduction of non-recourse factoring, there is no exposure to credit risk.


-----

###### The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade and other receivables, including receivables from Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group does not hold collateral as security. There were no significant credit risks or concentration of risk as of 31 December 2023.

 Financial instruments and cash deposits

 Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties, which have a long-term rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s. The restrictions are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through a counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.

##### Liquidity risk

###### The Group provides sufficient liquidity for each individual entity by cash pooling. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank loans. The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. The Group has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders. The Group has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding with no major debt maturing before 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility of EUR 110,000k was only partially utilized for trade finance related instruments (EUR 12,088k).

 The Group also participates in a supply chain financing arrangement with the principal purpose of facilitating efficient payment processing of supplier invoices. Although there is a concentration of risk because payables previously distributed among a high number of creditors are now concentrated in the financial institutions involved, the liquidity risk from supply chain financing is deemed to be low as the Group diversified the relevant financial instruments among different bank partners with an investment grade rating.

-----

###### to the above-mentioned departments Additionally, certain companies of the Group obtain key management personnel services from Best Secret Group SE.

##### Leases

###### Certain Group companies have entered into lease agreements regarding business premises from third parties. Certain such lease agreements are concluded with private partnerships in which some members of the Schustermann and Borenstein families as well as certain members of the advisory board or close family members of those related parties are partners.

 PTGMidCo S.à.r.l. holds 89.62% of PTGLUX S.à.r.l., which wholly owns the Best Secret Group SE  and is therefore a controlling party to the Group.

 During the reporting period ended 31 December 2023, the Group has not been a party to any other material transaction, or proposed transactions, in which any related party had or was to have a direct or indirect material interest. This is unchanged to prior year.

##### 6.3. Additional disclosures on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income

 Segment reporting

###### The reportable segments for fiscal year 2023, the Group segments are “Germany” and “International”.

 As of 31 December 2023, non-current assets (excluding financial assets) of EUR 511,906k (prior year: EUR 534,794k) are located in Germany and EUR 153,496k (prior year: EUR 98,316k) are located in other countries.

 Management measures the performance of the segments on the basis of revenues and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income/loss for the period before interest and similar expenses, tax and depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and the reversal of impairment losses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding exceptional items and including pro forma synergies. Therefore, the reconciliation from EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA includes non-recurring, extraordinary and other non-operational items as well as run rate cost synergies from fulfillment center network expansion (calculated as percentage of revenue). The Group intends to achieve meaningful cost synergies from the expansion of its fulfillment operations. The expected cost synergies result from improved unit economics on the basis of capacity optimization (reduction of utilization rate of existing fulfillment center and the elimination of the need to rent additional warehouse capacity) as well as from wage and automation benefits.

 There are no intersegment transactions in the internal reporting structure. No information on segment assets or liabilities is available or relevant for decision-making. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.

_International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial_
_law pursuant to Section 315e para. 1 of the HGB, as well as the group management report, prepared on the basis of the_
_HGB, of PrestigeBidCo GmbH, Aschheim, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 as a whole and not solely to the_
_consolidated financial statements presented in this Offering Memorandum on the preceding pages. The group management_
_report is not part of this Offering Memorandum._

# Independent auditor’s report

###### To PrestigeBidCo GmbH

### Opinions

###### We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PrestigeBidCo GmbH, Aschheim and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, the consolidated cash flow statement and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the Group management report of PrestigeBidCo GmbH for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.

 In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit

   - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with
###### the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, and

   - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of
###### the Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

 Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

### Basis for the opinions

###### We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report in accordance with section 317 HGB, and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer


-----

###### [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the Group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

### Other Information

###### The executive directors are responsible for the other information, which probably will be provided after the issuance of our audit opinion. The other information comprises the Annual Bond Report 2023, but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited parts of the group management report and not our audit opinion.

 Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

 In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information

 • is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

 • otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

### Responsibilities of the executive directors for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report 

###### The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial  statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB
 [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and, that the consolidated financial  statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable


-----

###### the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.

 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

 Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

### Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report

###### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

 Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) [and supplementary compliance with the ISAs] will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.


-----

###### We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

 • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

 • Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB.

 • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.


-----

###### • Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

 • Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

### 1. Company information

###### The consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2022 of PrestigeBidCo GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Group” or the “BestSecret Group”) were authorized by the Management Board by the signed financial statements dated   5 April 2023. The registered office of PrestigeBidCo GmbH (the parent) is located at Margaretha- Ley-Ring 27, Aschheim, Germany. The Company is registered with Munich Local Court (HRB 227078).

 The Group operates as a leading European members-only destination for off-price fashion with attractive discount rates represented by the online platform BestSecret.

 PrestigeBidCo GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Secret Group SE (former Best Secret Group AG). PrestigeBidCo GmbH publishes consolidated financial statements in accordance with Sec. 291 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and voluntarily in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).


-----

### 2. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements

##### 2.1. General information and application of IFRS

###### The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted in the European Union (EU). A Group management report and the obligatory disclosures to be made under German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB were added to the consolidated financial statements.

 To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of comprehensive income have been aggregated. These items are shown and explained separately in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 The presentation and the components of the consolidated financial statements comply with the rules in IAS 1.10. The consolidated statement of comprehensive income is prepared based on the function of expense method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared based on IAS 7.

 The consolidated financial statements are prepared based on historical costs on the reporting date, 31 December 2022. Historical costs are generally based on the fair value of the consideration transferred in exchange for the asset. The fair value is the price that would be received in orderly transactions between market participants on the measurement date for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of liabilities. This applies regardless of whether the price can be directly observed or is estimated using a measurement method.

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (EUR k), unless otherwise indicated. Due to rounding, it is possible that figures may not add up exactly to the total stated, and the percentages presented may not precisely reflect the figures they correspond to.

 The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year. The fiscal year of the consolidated entities also corresponds to the calendar year.

 The management prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.


-----

##### 2.2. Amended standards and interpretations

###### 2.2.1 New or amended IFRS applied in the fiscal year

 The Group applied all standards and interpretations (including amendments) as adopted by the EU in its consolidated financial statements which are mandatory for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2022.

 The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020, which are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.

 Other amendments to standards that were mandatory from 1 January 2022 relate to amendments to IFRS 16 (COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions), IAS 37 (Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract), IAS 16 and IFRS 3.

 Application of the amendments did not have any effect on the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2022.

 2.2.2 New or amended IFRS not yet applied

 The following accounting standards relevant for the Group had already been issued by the IASB before the consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue, but their adoption is not yet mandatory and they have not yet been adopted by the Group and do not have any material impact on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position and performance.

Amendments to IAS 12
Income Taxes - Deferred Tax related to

Lease Liability in a Sale and Lease Back
Transaction


The amendment clarifies, that deferred
tax must be recognized when an entity
accounts for transactions that, on initial
recognition, give rise to equal taxable
and deductible temporary differences.
The amendments clarify in particular,
the recognition of deferred tax arising
from transactions such as leases or
restoration / decommissioning
obligations.

Due to the amendments to IFRS 16,
the standard now specifies that, in
subsequently measuring the lease
liability, the seller-lessee determines
‘lease payments’ and ‘revised lease
payments’ in a way that does not result
in the seller-lessee recognising any
amount of the gain or loss that relates
to the right of use it retains.


IFRS 17 The objective of this standard is to
Insurance Contracts establish principles for the recognition,
measurement, presentation and
disclosure of insurance contracts.

Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance
Contracts: Initial Application of IFRS 17 and
IFRS 9 - Comparative Information


The amendment establishes a
supplementary transition option
relating to comparatives in the first
reporting year, which allows for the
option of a different classification
pursuant to IFRS 9 (classification
overlay) for the comparative periods in
the year of first-time application of
both standards. Under this option, for
each financial asset for which the
comparative period has not been
adjusted to IFRS 9, the classification
underlying the information available at
the date of transition may be used. In
addition, for financial assets that relate
to insurance contracts, existing
classification options under IFRS 9 can
be exercised again, if IFRS 9 was
applied prior to the first-time
application of IFRS 17.

Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance The amendment defers the first-time
Contracts application of IFRS 17 to 1 January
2023. The fundamental principles
under IFRS 17 remain unaffected. The
amendments to the standard, which
refer to specific topics, are aimed at
helping entities implement the
standard and, at the same time,
avoiding a significant loss of useful
information. The option for companies
to delay application of IFRS 9 until the
initial application of IFRS 17 has also
been extended until 1 January 2023.



- For standards and amendments to standards not yet endorsed by the EU, the date of first-time adoption scheduled by the IASB is assumed for
the time being as the likely date of first-time adoption.

##### 2.3. Principles of consolidation

###### 2.3.1 Basis of consolidation and group information

 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as of 31 December 2022. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, it has:

 • Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)


-----

###### • Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee

 • The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

 Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

 • The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee

 • Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

 • The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

 The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non- controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

 As a general rule, subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements by way of full consolidation from the time when the Group obtained control over or the ability to control the subsidiary. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.


-----

###### The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the parent company PrestigeBidCo GmbH and its fully consolidated subsidiaries summarized in the following table:

**Shareholding in %**

**Company name** **Location** **31 Dec 2022**

PrestigeBidCo GmbH Aschheim

Best Secret GmbH Aschheim 100

Lawrence Grey GmbH Aschheim 100

Best Secret Logistik GmbH Poing 100

###### In fiscal year 2022 Schustermann & Borenstein Wien GmbH was renamed Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH.

 In the context of our continued growth and internationalization, Best Secret Poland Sp. z o.o. was established on 18 February 2022. The entity will operate an additional fulfillment center for the Best Secret Group. In addition, Best Secret Hellas S.M. S.A. was established on 15 March 2022. The company will mainly be used as a tech hub. In fiscal year 2022, Best Secret Hellas S.M. S.A.  and Best Secret Poland sp. z o.o. have been fully consolidated with economic effect as of 1 January 2022.

 Swiss Online Shopping AG is in liquidation.

##### The holding company

###### The next-senior holding company of PrestigeBidCo GmbH is Best Secret Group SE (Aschheim). Best Secret Group SE is the result of a merger of Best Secret Group AG and Best Secret Beteiligungsverwaltung AG in fiscal year 2022. The consolidated financial statements of Best Secret Group SE (smallest and largest consolidated group) are published in the electronic German Federal Gazette (“Bundesanzeiger”). The ultimate holding company of Best Secret Group SE is Permira Holdings Limited (St. Peter Port, Guernsey).


-----

###### 2.3.2 Consolidation methods

 Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the acquisition costs against the Group share of the fair value of the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries at the time of acquisition. At this juncture, the acquisition method is used. Receivables and corresponding liabilities of Group entities were offset against each other. Significant intercompany results from intra-Group service transactions were eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Sales and other income from intra-Group supply and service relationships were offset against the corresponding expenses. The financial statements of all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared as of 31 December 2022.

##### 2.4. Use of estimates and assumptions

###### The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that have effects on the amounts carried and the related disclosures. Although these estimates are based on the current events and measures to the best of management’s knowledge, there may be deviations between estimated and actual results. Significant estimates and assumptions have been used for the following matters in particular:

 • Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts)

 • Determination and assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes

 • The determination of provisions for restoration expenses and other provisions

 • Assumptions for the calculation of returns and unredeemed coupons

 • Inventory valuation

 • Segment reporting

 • Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables

 • Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16


-----

###### • Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16

 • Assumptions with regards to notes measurement including separation of embedded derivatives

 These key forward-looking assumptions and estimates, which involve a significant risk of changing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year, are discussed below.

 2.4.1 Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and the war in Ukraine)

 All non-financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are tested for impairment if there are indicators that the asset may be impaired. Regardless of indicators of impairment, goodwill acquired in business combinations is tested for impairment once a year at the level of the cash- generating unit to which the asset belongs.

 This assessment implies significant judgment and estimates, in particular in light of the uncertainties in connection with the ongoing war in Ukraine. The ongoing war in Ukraine has been a source of continuous disruptions in global supply chains, leading to inflationary pressures on the supply, shipping, and fulfillment processes of the online market business in general.This was taken into account during the impairment testing for goodwill and the review of useful lives for the intangible assets recognized by using the purchase method in compliance with IFRS 3. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. This is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model that is the basis for the calculation of the value in use used as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant to goodwill. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 5.1.

 2.4.2 Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes

 Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for prior years. Various factors such as past experience with tax field audits and different treatment of tax regulations by tax authorities are considered.

 Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profit. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows.


-----

###### These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainty. Consequently, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets recognized at the reporting date. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the income statement.

 2.4.3 Determination of provisions for restorations expenses and other provisions

 The determination of provisions for restoration expenses requires assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rates, expected costs and timing of these costs. If the interest effect resulting from the discounting is significant, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.

 Provisions mainly comprise provisions for restoration expenses and provisions for restructuring. Whether a present obligation is probable or not requires judgment. The nature and type of risks for these provisions differ, and management’s judgment is applied regarding the nature and extent of obligations in deciding if an outflow of resources is probable or not.

 2.4.4 Calculation of returns and unredeemed gift vouchers

 Returns

 For transactions with a statutory 14-day or longer refund policy, the Group calculates the amount of the expected returns as of the reporting date based on historical return rates under consideration of the actual returns until the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements, which are taken into account in order to reduce revenue. As of 31 December 2022, deferred sales amounted to EUR 37,952k (prior year: EUR 39,666k). The right to recover possession of expected returns is reported under other current non-financial assets.

 Unredeemed gift vouchers

 The acquiring customer has a claim from the sale of vouchers for fulfillment up to a period of three years. If vouchers sold are not redeemed within this period, the Group realizes the revenue from the voucher sale. Liabilities from the sale of gift vouchers are recognized under other liabilities and amounted as of 31 December 2022 to EUR 2,036k (prior year: EUR 1,983k).


-----

###### 2.4.5 Inventory valuation

 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary costs to make the sale. Estimates are necessary to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. Further details are given in note 5.6.

 2.4.6 Segment reporting

 IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) of the Group for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the respective segments. Since fiscal year 2021, the Group segments are “Germany” and “International”. Primary emphasis is placed on the key performance indicators, revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The recognition and measurement methods of the reportable segments correspond to the consolidated recognition and measurement methods described in note 6.3.

 2.4.7 Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables

 The determination of the necessity and amount of valuation allowances on receivables requires assumptions and estimates regarding the credit risk and underlying time intervals. In the case of a return debit, the Company informs the customer and defines a period for payment. When the defined time period has elapsed, written warnings are sent to the customers. Further details are given in note 5.7. and note 5.17.

 The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due and the Group’s historical default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on expectations as to the collectability of the receivables.

 2.4.8 Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16

 The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering the debt structure of the Group and the useful life of the leased assets. To measure lease liabilities the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group estimates the incremental borrowing rate by using observable input factors.


-----

###### 2.4.9 Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16

 The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering the overall business development as well as the term of existing leases.

 2.4.10 Assumptions with regards to notes measurement including separation of embedded derivatives

 The embedded redemption option for the note issued in 2022 is considered to be not closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9, neither the option’s exercise price is equal to the carrying amount of the host contract on each exercise date, nor the lender is reimbursed for an amount up to the present value of lost interest for the remaining term of the host contract. Since both, the prepayment option and the interest rate floor relate to the interest risk, both derivatives are treated as a single compound embedded derivative.

 The methodology used to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives is based on the approach of a Monte Carlo simulation. The refinancing rate is divided into a risk-free component and a credit risk component in the form of a credit spread. The simulation of the risk-free rate is based on a Hull/White 1-factor model and the simulation of the credit spread is based on a standard Wiener process. The optimal trade-off is determined on the basis of the Longstaff/ Schwart approach. The starting point for the floor component is the simulated risk-free interest rates. Based on the simulated interest rates, floorlets are formed for each individual quarter during the term of the notes, which are then valued using the Black76 approach. The floorlet component is valued taking into account any exercise of the call option during the simulation.

##### 2.5. Business combinations and goodwill

###### Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquire at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.


-----

###### When the Group acquirees a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date.

 Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

 After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. In case of any structural changes of the respective CGUs within the Group, an impairment review and potential reallocation of the Goodwill according to IAS 36 is performed. More detailed information on impairment testing can be found in note 5.1.

##### 2.6. Current and non-current portions

###### The Group classifies its assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position as current and non- current assets or liabilities.

 An asset is classified as current when:

 • it is expected to be realized, or intended to be sold or consumed, within the normal operating cycle,

 • it is expected to be realized within 12 months after the reporting period or

 • it is cash or a cash equivalent, unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for a period of at least 12 months.

 All other assets are classified as non-current.

 A liability is classified as current if:

 • it is expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle,

 • it is expected to be realized within 12 months of the end of the reporting period or

 • the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.


-----

###### All other liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

##### 2.7. Fair value measurement

###### The Group applies measurement techniques that are appropriate under the respective circumstances and for which sufficient data is available for fair value measurement. In the process, observable market inputs are to be preferred to non-observable inputs.

 Assets and liabilities measured or presented at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are classified on the basis of the following fair value hierarchy. The classification uses the input parameters of the lowest category that is material to the fair value measurement.

 • Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

 • Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly

 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the assets and liabilities

##### 2.8. Revenue recognition

###### The Group recognizes revenue according to IFRS 15 at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods to the customers, net of taxes and duties, and taking into account agreed payment terms. Revenue is reported net of discounts, rebates, taxes and returns. Since the Group has price discretion in its sales transactions and also bears the inventory and credit risk, the Group generally acts as a principal and is therefore the principal party of all sales transactions.

 In addition, the Group purchases some products, such as jewelry, on a commission basis. In this case, the Group is acting as an agent, but is free in the setting of prices. Revenue is recognized net of commissions earned.

 Revenue recognition requires the fulfillment of the following recognition criteria:

##### Sale of goods and products

###### The Group’s contracts with customers for the sale of merchandise generally include a single performance obligation. The Group has concluded that revenue from the sale of merchandise


-----

###### should be recognized at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. In the stationary retail business, revenue is therefore recognized upon handing over the goods and in online trading upon delivery of the goods to the customer.

##### Accounting treatment of returns in the online business

###### Under IFRS 15, the consideration received from the customer is variable because the contract allows the customer to return the products. The Group uses the expected value method to estimate the merchandise that will be returned, because this method predicts most accurately the amount of variable consideration to which the Group will be entitled. The Group applies the requirements in IFRS 15 on constraining estimates of variable consideration such as return rate to determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. The Group presents a refund liability (other current financial liabilities) and an asset (other current non- financial assets) for the right to recover possession of goods from a customer separately in the statement of financial position, taking into account the costs incurred for processing the return and the losses resulting from disposing of these goods. The Group presents the expected returns of goods on a gross basis in the statement of comprehensive income and reduces revenue by the full amount of sales that it estimates to be returned. The dispatch of goods that is recorded in full when they are shipped is then corrected by the estimated value of the returns. Generally, the Group allows goods to be returned within a period of 14 days of receipt. Longer periods may be agreed upon contractually.

##### Friends recommend friends – customer acquisition program

###### The Group has implemented a recommendation program for customers. Every time the invitee (recommended customer) places an order, the inviting customer (inviter) receives a one-time commission voucher of 10% to 20%. The inviter also receives a 5% to 7% voucher based on the total purchases of the invitee within a period of 12 months. According to IFRS 15, both vouchers represent payments to the inviting customer under IFRS 15 as costs to initiate a contract with a new customer (invitee). The purchase of the service is to be accounted for in the same way as purchases from suppliers (IFRS 15.71). The customer referral service is to be measured at fair value (or the lower transaction price). If the consideration payable to the customer exceeds the fair value of the customer referral service, the difference is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price. In the event that the fair value of the customer referral service cannot be estimated with sufficient reliability, the entire consideration payable to the customer is to be recognized as a reduction of revenue. The Group is currently unable to estimate the fair value of the customer referral service with sufficient reliability, so the consideration payable to customers is to be recognized as a reduction of revenue when the customer redeems it.


-----

##### 2.9. Government grants

###### Government grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the conditions for the grants are met and the grants will actually be received. Grants that relate to income and future periods must be recognized in the correct period in line with the corresponding expenses. Grants related to income that have already been received for subsequent periods must be recognized under liabilities and released on a pro rata basis in subsequent periods. Grants that accrue to the employees must be shown as a flow-through item.

##### 2.10. Taxes

 Current income taxes

###### Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

 For the purpose of measuring current German taxes, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15% is applied to distributed and retained earnings and a solidarity surcharge rate of 5.5% is applied to that amount. That yields a tax rate of 15.83%. In addition, German trade tax is imposed on profits earned in Germany. The trade tax is based on the assessment rates of the various municipalities and the basic federal rate, which has been a flat rate of 3.5% according to Sec. 11 (2) GewStG [“Gewerbesteuergesetz”: German Trade Tax Act] since the corporate tax reform in 2008. The trade tax varies depending on the different assessment rates of the municipalities, but a flat rate of 11.29% is applied in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

 The profits earned by the non-German Group companies are calculated on the basis of the national tax laws applicable in each country and taxed at the tax rates in effect in those countries. The country- specific tax rates range from 21 to 25%. The Group tax rate is 27.12%. Current tax expenses are calculated on the basis of the taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs from the net profit presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a result of the expenses and income that will not be taxable or that become tax-exempt in later years. The Group’s liability for current taxes is calculated on the basis of the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted in the near future.


-----

##### Deferred taxes

###### Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

 Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:

 • Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 • In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

 Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:

 • Where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the pre-tax accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 • In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

 The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.


-----

###### Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the end of the reporting period.

 Deferred income tax relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and not in the profit or loss.

 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

 Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in profit or loss.

##### Value added tax

###### Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of value added tax (VAT) except:

 • If VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case VAT is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as applicable; and

 • Where receivables, payables and finance lease liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

 The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

##### 2.11. Foreign currencies

###### Generally, foreign currency transactions in the single-entity financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries included in the basis of consolidation are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Therefore, foreign currency monetary items are recognized at


-----

###### the closing date in the balance sheet. The differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss.

 Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

 Thus, in the event of a discrepancy between the local and functional currency, financial statements of subsidiaries and associates in currencies outside the eurozone are translated using the functional currency method.

##### Foreign currency transactions and balances

###### Generally, foreign currency transactions in the single-entity financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Therefore, foreign currency monetary items are recognized at the closing date in the balance sheet. The differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss.

 Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

 Thus, in the event of a discrepancy between the local and functional currency, financial statements of subsidiaries and associates in currencies outside the eurozone are translated using the functional currency method.

##### Foreign operations

###### The Group has analyzed the Group companies and concluded that for each company the currency of origin represents the functional currency. During consolidation, all assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the closing rate. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the respective reporting date, while equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is recognized in profit or loss.


-----

##### 2.12. Intangible assets

###### Intangible assets acquired in the context of a business combination under IFRS 3 are recognized separately from goodwill and measured at fair value at the acquisition date. This includes customer bases and brand names. These are recognized as an intangible asset according to IAS 38, measured at fair value and amortized over their expected useful lives.

 An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.

 Intangible assets which are not acquired as part of a business combination but as purchased licenses are initially recognized at cost.

 Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful life. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indications of impairment at the reporting date. The remaining useful life and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of a reporting period. If the reasons for impairment have been eliminated, a reversal to a maximum of the historical cost is set as the upper limit. Required changes in the amortization period and method are treated as changes in estimates. Impairment losses on intangible assets, e.g., customer base and brand names, with finite useful lives are included in amortization within selling expenses.

**Total useful life in years**

"Schustermann & Borenstein" brand name 5*

"BestSecret" brand name 20

"Schustermann & Borenstein" costumer base 8*

"BestSecret" costumer base 8

- Due to the rebranding the total useful life for the brand name “Schustermann & Borenstein” was reduced from 30 years to 5 years as of January 1,
2019. At the same time, the total useful life of the customer base “Schustermann & Borenstein” was reduced from 20 years to 14 years. Reviewing
the useful lives at the end of 2021 showed the need for prospective alignment of the remaining useful life of the respective customer bases to 3
years from the 2022 reporting period onwards. This reduces the total useful life for the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base accordingly to
8 years. As of 31 December, 2021,“Schustermann & Borenstein” brand name is fully depreciated.


-----

###### In the case of internally generated intangible assets, IAS 38 makes a distinction between the research phase and the development phase. Costs incurred during the research phase cannot be capitalized; instead they must be recognized as an expense. Though, development costs are capitalized, if the development costs can be reliably measured, the product or process is technically and commercially appropriate, a future commercial benefit is probable, and the Group intends and has adequate resources to complete the development and use or sell the asset. The Group primarily develops key components of software (BestSecret website and the BestSecret app as well as expenses for the Group’s other IT-systems and infrastructure) used by the Group. A useful life of 4 to 5 years is assumed for development activities in connection with the software.

##### 2.13. Property, plant and equipment

###### Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost and depreciated in accordance with their expected useful life using the straight-line method. The Group treats changes in the residual values or useful lives that arise during use as a change in estimates. Depreciation is charged over the following useful lives.

**Total useful life in years**

Land, property rights and buildings including buildings on third-party land 5-20

Plant and machinery 11-13

Other equipment 3-23

###### An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.

 The residual values, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. If the carrying amount of a tangible asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized, in addition to systematic depreciation, in order to lower the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (net selling price) and the present value of the net cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset. Whenever possible, the net selling price is derived from the most recently observed market transactions.


-----

##### 2.14. Inventories

###### Merchandise accounted for as inventories is recognized at cost pursuant to IAS 2. Cost is calculated on the basis of an item-by-item measurement, factoring in the additions from the point of view of the sourcing market or on the basis of the moving average price of the goods. Incidental acquisition costs are generally measured on a monthly basis. Supplier payments that are to be classified as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of inventories. Consumption of inventories is recognized within the costs of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.

 Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The net realizable value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. Adequate write- downs to net realizable value were made to consider all risks due to slow- moving goods and/or reduced salability. When the circumstances that previously caused merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist, the write-down is reversed.

##### 2.15. Impairment of non-financial assets

###### The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset reported in the statement of financial position may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing is required, the Group carries out an impairment test. Further details are given in note 5.1.

##### 2.16. Cash and cash equivalents

###### Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. The “Cash and cash equivalents” item in the consolidated statement of financial position comprises cash, bank balances and credit balances with Payment Service Providers with a banking license (cash in transit). Credit balances with Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license are reported as ”trade and other receivables” in the consolidated statement of financial position. The cash in transit balances are presented as cash equivalents as these balances are immediately credited to the bank account with the payment service providers over which the company has direct power of disposal.

 For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the cash and cash equivalents defined above are presented less overdraft facilities that have been drawn, as these are an integral part of the Group’s available cash.


-----

##### 2.17. Leases

 The Group as a lessee

###### The Group leases various properties, equipment and vehicles. Leases are typically entered into for periods of 2 to 20 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

 Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is broken down into an interest component and a principal repayment. Interest is recognized in the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for the reporting period (effective interest method). It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

 The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

 Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

 • fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable

 • lease payments covering renewal periods considered in the determination of the lease term

 • variable lease payments that are based on an index or an (interest) rate to the extend that the a change in the index or rate has actually triggered a change in the lease payments

 • amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees

 • the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and


-----

###### • payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

 The lease payments are discounted using the the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

 Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

 • the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability

 • any lease payments made at or before the commencement date

 • any initial direct costs, and

 • restoration costs.

 Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low- value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.

##### The Group as lessor

###### The Group sub-lets office and retail space.

 When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

 In case of finance leases, rental income is recognized using the effective interest method over the term of the subleases and reported in interest income. Payments received from operating subleases are recognized within other operating income.

##### 2.18. Trade and other receivables

###### The “Trade and other receivables” item in the statement of financial position comprises balances with payment service providers not holding a banking license and receivables against customers.

 Trade receivables are initially recognized at the settlement-date fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is usually the original invoice value less a loss allowance for


-----

###### expected impairment losses. The loss allowance for trade receivables is determined based on lifetime expected credit losses, which are calculated as the present value of expected cash shortfalls. Changes are recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

 For its online customers, the Group offers the option to purchase on account. In connection with this payment option, the Group works with a factoring provider, transferring substantially all risks and rewards resulting from the receivables to the factoring company and derecognizing receivables in the statement of financial position.

##### 2.19. Other financial assets

###### Other financial assets are initially recognized on the settlement date. The Group classifies its financial assets as “at amortized cost”. No financial assets are held “at fair value through profit or loss” or “at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)” on the reporting date. At initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

 Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount, are measured “at amortized cost”. A gain or loss on such an instrument subsequently measured at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is sold or impaired. Interest income from this type of financial asset is included in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.

 Credit risks related to debt instruments at amortized cost held by the Group at the reporting date are considered to be low. Therefore, the regular approach in accordance with IFRS 9 requires the Group to determine, at inception as well as on an ongoing basis during the lifetime of the debt instrument, the allowance as the credit losses expected in the next 12 months. If the credit risk were to increase and no longer be regarded as low-risk, lifetime expected credit losses would have to be recognized. The Group considers credit risk as significantly increased if debt instruments are past due for more than 30 days. For trade receivables, a separate approach is applied for measuring impairment (see 2.17, 5.7 and 5.17.).

 Other financial assets are included in other current financial assets, except for those with maturity dates more than 12 months after the reporting date, which are presented as non-current financial assets.


-----

##### 2.20. Financial liabilities

###### Financial liabilities are recognized when a Group company is a contractual party to a financial instrument on the settlement date. Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the duration of the obligation using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount upon initial recognition.

 The embedded redemption option for the note is considered to be not closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. The redemption option and the interest rate floor of the host contract are treated as a single compound embedded derivative (see 2.4.10).

 Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade and other payables and other liabilities, are measured at amortized cost. Trade and other payables are amounts owed as consideration for goods or services provided to the Group in the normal course of business including amounts owed to a payment service provider governing the settlement of supplier liabilities. In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are therefore classified as current; otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or nominal value.

 The Group derecognizes a financial liability when the related obligation has been paid, canceled or has expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized financial liability and the consideration received or due is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

##### 2.21. Provisions

###### Provisions are recognized in accordance with IAS 37 when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.


-----

###### A best estimate is made of the amount of the provisions, taking into consideration all the discernible risks arising from the obligation. This refers to the amount that is most likely needed to settle the liability. Provisions with a residual term of more than one year are discounted on the reporting date.

 Provisions for restoration obligations

 The Group recognizes provisions for restoration obligations for leasehold improvements in the leased warehouses and office buildings. The provision is recognized at an amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated future restoration obligations. The restoration obligations are recognized as part of the cost of the leasehold improvements at the corresponding amount. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is commensurate to the maturity and risk profile. The unwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and recognized as an interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income.

 Provisions for restructuring measures

 Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized to the extent that decisions by management have been announced in sufficient detail to those affected as of the reporting date. The definition of a restructuring measure includes for example basic reorganization with significant effects on the focus of business activities.

##### 2.22. Share-based payment

###### Certain executives and executive management (managers) were given the opportunity to invest in different German limited partnerships, which indirectly own interests of approximately 5% in the Group. The subscription price for the partnership interests subscribed by the managers in the limited partnership corresponded to their fair value at grant date.

 The acquisition qualifies as a share-based payment under IFRS 2, and the managers’ interests in the limited partnership are recognized as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement in the financial statements. As the investments in the partnership were acquired at fair value, no expense is recognized as a result of this transaction. The participation rights in form of partnership interests were acquired from an entity outside the Group, and the Group has no obligation to make any payments on the partnership interests to the managers. The share-based payment arrangements are fully vested at grant date. The sales constitute a performance vesting condition that is considered a non-market performance condition. If the service condition is met, then the manager can exercise his or her option at the market value per share. The investment program provides for various industry-standard cancellation and settlement events.


-----

##### 2.23. Significant events after the reporting date

###### In 2021, BestSecret Group began simplifying and harmonizing its corporate structure. On January 18, 2023, the final step in this process was implemented by converting Best Secret Group AG into Best Secret Group SE. An internationally composed SE Works Council was established and the inaugural meeting took place on February 22, 2023.

 In January 2023, PrestigeBidCo GmbH entered into hedging agreements for a majority of its EUR 350,000k Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes issued in July 2022 to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

 The shareholders of PrestigeBidCo GmbH have resolved to distribute an intra-group dividend to Best Secret Group SE amounting to EUR 4,500k.

 To further support the Group’s growth and international expansion, BestSecret is investing into its fulfillment center network. Construction on a new fulfillment center in Poland started in 2022. At the end of March 2023, the new center was in use as a manual warehouse as planned, and operations will be ramped up over the next months.


-----

### 3. Capital management

###### The Group analyses its capital based on the equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, including all components of equity as shown on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximize the value of the Group.

 It is the objective of the capital management of the Group to ensure amongst other things that it meets the financial covenants, which define leverage ratio thresholds. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the RCF banks to call any drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions. The Group monitors capital using both, a senior secured leverage ratio and an interest ratio, which is Senior Secured Net Debt*/Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA/ Interest Expense respectively as of particular effective date. The Group’s policy is to keep the leverage ratio well below the level 4,75:1 and the interest ratio above 2:1 and to reduce net debt over time. The Group achieved these targets in 2022.

 No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the reporting period ended 31 December 2022.

- Senior Secured Net Debt consists of the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility less cash and cash equivalents.

### 4. Notes to the statement of comprehensive income

##### 4.1. Revenue

###### In fiscal year 2022 the Group recognized revenue of EUR 1,051,027k (prior year: EUR 942,884k). Group operates based on the internal management structure two segments Germany and International. The Group’s strong revenue growth was driven by a further growth in the number of active customers combined with robust order economics. The international segment was the main growth driver in revenue in 2022.

###### The amount of revenue included in the contract liability at the beginning of the year is EUR 12,580k (prior year: EUR 15,148k).

 No element of financing is deemed present as the payment of the customer is completed within several days, and satisfaction of the performance obligation is within a short period of time.

 There are no contracts with customer with duration longer than one year. Consequently, no disclosure of the transaction price is necessary, since the entity elects to apply the practical expedient in IFRS 15.121(a).

Goodwill 172,956 30,592 203,548

###### Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year by comparing the carrying amounts of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated with their recoverable amount. The value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method based on the current midterm plan for the CGU concerned.

 The major planning assumptions are:

 • Revenue/EBITDA margin

 • Discount rates

 • Growth rates used for the extrapolation of the cash flow forecasts beyond the financial planning period

###### Revenue/EBITDA margin – The budgeted revenues and earnings for each CGU are based on freely available economic and industry-specific data and take into account past trends and events alongside current market forecasts.

 Discount rates – The underlying discount rates reflect the current market forecasts with regards to the CGU-specific risks, including interest rate and asset-specific risks for which no adjustments regarding the forecast future cash flows were performed.

 The assumptions underlying the impairment test performed are stated for the CGUs Germany and International in the table below.

**Germany 2022** **International 2022**

Weighted average cost of capital after taxes 9.1 % 10.1 %

Long-term growth rate 2.0 % 2.5 %

Revenue growth Solid growth Solid growth

EBIT growth Solid growth Solid growth

**Germany 2021** **International 2021**

Weighted average cost of capital after taxes 7.4 % 8.6 %

Long-term growth rate 2.0 % 2.5 %

Revenue growth Solid growth Solid growth

EBIT growth Solid growth Solid growth

###### To conduct the impairment test, the total carrying amount of the cash-generating units is compared against the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the value in use, based on discounted future cash flows. Expected cash flows are determined based on a suitable planning process. Internal information and external macroeconomic indicators are taken into consideration. The current detailed planning period covers four years. Generally, a long-term growth rate of 2.0% to 2.5% (see table above) is applied. As a general rule, the discount factor is calculated as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) applying the capital asset pricing model. For this purpose, a peer group is used for all groups of cash-generating units operating in the same business segment. The beta factor is calculated annually based on freely available market data. For both CGUs the same beta factor was applied. A country risk premium was applied for the CGU International in addition.

 Furthermore, the discount factors are determined on the basis of the following assumptions: a base interest rate of 2.0% (prior year: 0.1%) and a market risk premium of 7.5% (prior year: 7.5%)


-----

###### as of 31 December 2022 for Germany. Country-specific risk premiums are applied to both the equity cost rate and the debt capital cost rate, based on the credit rating of the respective country.

 The corresponding pre-tax WACC amount to 11.6% for the CGU Germany and 12.6% for the CGU International.

 For the purposes of estimating the development of revenues, EBITDA margin, specific growth rates were assumed in conducting the impairment test of the respective CGUs. Furthermore, customary market EBITDA margins were assumed for calculating sustainable earnings.

 The company is not directly affected by the consequences of the war in Ukraine. There have been indirect effects, driven by the continuing inflationary pressure on supply, shipping and fulfillment in the short-term, which led to temporary negative EBITDA margin effects. These aspects were taken into account in the impairment test.

 The annual impairment test as of 31 December 2022 confirmed the recoverability of the capitalized goodwill for the CGU Germany and International respectively, each with substantial headroom also after performing sensitivity analysis taking into consideration reasonably possible changes of material assumptions.

###### Financing fees for revolving credit facility as of 31 December 2022 increased due to the transaction costs for entering into a new revolving credit facility agreement in 2022. For further information regarding the derivative financial instruments refer to note 5.17.

 As in the prior year, there are no receivables from subleasing with a term of more than five years. Non-current financial assets mainly increased due to a loan made in amount of EUR 2,950k to PTGMidco S.à.r.l. located in Luxembourg, in December 2022.

##### 5.6. Inventories

###### Inventories of merchandise, mainly consisting of apparel, shoes and accessories, amount to   EUR 263,693k (prior year: EUR 232,948k).

The change in expenses for allowance on inventories came to EUR 1,002k in the reporting period (prior year: decrease of EUR 2,687k) driven by an increase in gross inventories. Expenses for allowance were recognized within the cost of sales. Further details on cost of sales are given in note 4.2.

 In 2022, inventories of EUR 596,893k (prior year: EUR 505,092k) were recognized as an expense during the year and included in cost of sales.

##### 5.7. Trade and other receivables

###### Trade and other receivables amounted to EUR 8,743k as of 31 December 2022 (prior year:    EUR 9,468k).

 Trade and other receivables are due from Payment Service Providers (EUR 8,641k, prior year:  EUR 9,202k) and customers (EUR 101k, prior year: EUR 266k). Receivables against Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license are reported as “trade and other receivables” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

 Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally due for immediate payment.

###### The Group uses a provision matrix in order to measure the expected credit losses on trade receivables from individuals, which comprise a very large number of small balances. When calculating the expected credit losses, non-representative individual cases (receivables from wholesale customers) are excluded. The impairment is calculated individually for those individual cases. The table above shows both the expected credit losses from receivables from individuals and for individual cases.

 In 2022, a new process was introduced for dunning in the receivables area. Overdue receivables are tracked more precisely and are consistently adjusted or derecognized at an earlier stage.

###### Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) (which is subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 6.0%. Interest payment dates are quarterly in arrears on 15 January, 15 April, 15 July and 15 October of each year.

##### Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

###### PrestigeBidCo GmbH entered into a new revolving credit facility agreement totaling EUR 110,000k on 14 July, 2022 which replaced any previous revolving credit facility agreement. The original lenders are Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., London Branch and UniCredit Bank AG. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of Letters of Credit (upon the appointment of an Issuing Bank) and by way of any Ancillary Facilities that may be made available thereunder (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Borrowings are available to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group. As of the reporting date, EUR 4,555k of the total facility amount were utilized by issued guarantees and reduced the available amount. The new facility increases BestSecret Group’s flexibility with regards to the financing of its increased working capital needs due to its growing business volume and the seasonality of the fashion business, as well as its growth investments into a new fulfillment center and a notably improved tech and data structure of the Group. The maturity of the facility is 15 April, 2027.

###### No deferred taxes were recognized on unused tax losses of EUR 0k (prior year: EUR 8,738k).

 The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities if, and only if, it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities related to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.

 Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in case it is not likely that the Company will be able to generate enough taxable profits during the planning period. If a tax group has been implemented the unused tax losses are frozen.

 There are temporary differences in connection with investments in subsidiaries, and no deferred tax liabilities were recognized on these.

The fair value of the interest bearing loans and borrowings (Senior Secured Notes) are disclosed separately in the table below.

 The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair values. Financial instruments with fair value measurement based on quoted prices in active markets are disclosed in Level 1.

###### Unchanged to prior year, no financial instruments were set off and no enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements are in place as of 31 December 2022.

 The Group issued senior secured floating rate notes due 2027 in the amount of EUR 315,000k on 25 July 2022 and EUR 35,000k on 28 July 2022 for an issue price of 85%. Interest accrues at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the sum of the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) (which is subject to a 1.0% floor) plus 6.0%. Interest payment dates are quarterly in arrears on 15 January, 15 April, 15 July and 15 October of each year. With the proceeds from the issue, the Group refinanced the previous notes (EUR 260,000k) maturing in December 2023 and will finance part of the investments in the new fulfillment center in Poland.

 The Group identified an embedded derivative within the senior secured floating rate notes. The embedded derivative is separated and measured at fair value through profit and loss. Details on the valuation technique and the inputs used in the fair value measurement are included in note 2.4.10.

Financial assets at amortized cost (trade receivables) (96) (244)

**Financial liabilities at amortized cost** **(38,526)** **(1,145)**

###### Net losses in “financial assets at amortized cost” and “financial liabilities at amortized cost” mainly comprise loss allowances and interest based on the effective interest method. Net losses of “financial liabilities at amortized cost” are also affected by the extent of Senior Secured Notes issued in 2022.

##### Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments

###### The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise a Senior Secured Notes as well as trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables as well as cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.

 The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Group treasury oversees these risks. The Group’s senior management is supported by group treasury with advice on financial risks for the Group. The Management Board reviews and agrees processes for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.

##### Market risk

###### Market risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.

 The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as of 31 December 2022. The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net liabilities, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the liabilities and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of provisions, the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

 The sensitivity analyses demonstrate how profit or loss items are affected by the assumed changes in respective market risks.

|in EUR k|31 Dec 2022 31 Dec 2021|
|---|---|
|Financial assets at amortized cost (trade receivables)|(96) (244)|
|Financial liabilities at amortized cost|(38,526) (1,145)|

###### Interest rate risk

 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. As of 31 December 2022, the Senior Secured Note is affected by floating interest rates. The Group does not enter into interest rate derivatives to mitigate the underlying floating rate risk.

 Sensitivity of Group earnings to a change in underlying interest rates by a rise of 100 basis points and a fall of 100 basis points on variable-rate loans and borrowings as well as on the present value of derivative financial instruments are evaluated.

in EUR k **31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2021**

**Total** **(4,174)** **1,895** **—** **—**

###### Foreign currency risk

 Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant.

##### Credit risk and risk concentration

###### Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

 Concentration risks arising from the delivery of goods to major customers are subject to a special credit watch. In the case of a return debit, the Group has implemented a dunning process operated by an external service provider. The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking account of any collateral, is represented by their carrying amount. The Group offers under certain conditions purchase on account. Due to the introduction of non-recourse factoring, there is no exposure to credit risk.

 The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade and other receivables, including receivables from Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions. The


-----

###### Group does not hold collateral as security. There were no significant credit risks or concentration of risk as of 31 December 2022.

 Financial instruments and cash deposits

 Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties, which have a long-term rating of at least “A” by S&P or “A2” by Moody’s. The restrictions are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through a counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.

##### Liquidity risk

###### The Group provides sufficient liquidity for each individual entity by cash pooling. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank loans. The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. The Group has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders. The Group has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding with no major debt maturing before 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility of EUR 110,000k was only partially utilized for trade finance related instruments (EUR 4,555k).

 Segment reporting

###### The reportable segments for fiscal year 2022, the Group segments are “Germany” and “International”.

 As of 31 December 2022, non-current assets (excluding financial assets) of EUR 534,794k (prior year: EUR 568,753k) are located in Germany and EUR 98,316k (prior year: EUR 78,272k) are located in other countries.

 Management measures the performance of the segments on the basis of revenues and adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income/loss for the period before interest and similar expenses, tax and depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and the reversal of impairment losses. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding exceptional items and including pro forma synergies. Therefore, the reconciliation from EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA includes non-recurring, extraordinary and other non-operational items as well as run rate cost synergies from fulfillment center network expansion (calculated as percentage of revenue). The Group intends to achieve meaningful cost synergies from the expansion of its fulfillment operations. The expected cost synergies result from improved unit economics on the basis of capacity optimization (reduction of utilization rate of existing fulfillment center and the elimination of the need to rent additional warehouse capacity) as well as from wage and automation benefits.

 There are no intersegment transactions in the internal reporting structure. No information on segment assets or liabilities is available or relevant for decision-making. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.

_law pursuant to Section 315e para. 1 of the HGB, as well as the group management report, prepared on the basis of the_
_HGB, of PrestigeBidCo GmbH, Aschheim, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a whole and not solely to the_
_consolidated financial statements presented in this Offering Memorandum on the preceding pages. The group management_
_report is not part of this Offering Memorandum._

# Independent auditor’s report

###### To PrestigeBidCo GmbH

### Opinions

###### We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PrestigeBidCo GmbH, Aschheim and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2022, the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2022, the consolidated statements of cash flows and the consolidated statements of changes in equity for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2022 and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of PrestigeBidCo GmbH for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2022.

 In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit

   - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects,
###### with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2022, and

   - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of
###### the Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

 Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

### Basis for the opinions

-----

###### [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the Group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

### Other information

###### The executive directors are responsible for the other information, which probably will be provided after the issuance of our audit opinion. The other information comprises the Annual Bond Report 2022, but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited parts of the group management report and not our audit opinion.

 Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

 In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information

 • is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

 • otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

### Responsibilities of the executive directors for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report 

###### The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial  statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB
 [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and, that the consolidated financial  statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable


-----

###### the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.

 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

 Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

### Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report

###### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

 Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.


-----

###### We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

 • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

 • Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB
 [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code].

 • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the


-----

###### direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.

 • Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

 • Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021

### 1. Company information

###### The consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 of PrestigeBidCo GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Group” or the “Best Secret Group”) were authorized by the Management Board by the signed financial statements dated 11 April 2022. The registered office of PrestigeBidCo GmbH (the parent) is located at Margaretha- Ley-Ring 27, Aschheim, Germany. The Company is registered with Munich Local Court (HRB 227078).

 Based on a framework agreement signed 24 October 2016, PrestigeBidCo GmbH acquired Schustermann & Borenstein Holding GmbH and all its subsidiaries with an effective date as the basis for consolidation as of 19 January 2017.

 Prior to the acquisition of Schustermann & Borenstein Holding GmbH, PrestigeBidCo GmbH issued Senior Secured Notes (“Notes”) as of 20 December 2016 in the amount of EUR 260,000k with a maturity of seven years.

 The Group operates as a leading European members-only destination for off-price fashion with attractive discount rates represented by the online platform BestSecret.

 PrestigeBidCo GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Secret Group AG (former PrestigeBidCo Holding GmbH). PrestigeBidCo GmbH publishes consolidated financial statements in accordance with Sec. 291 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and voluntarily in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).


-----

### 2. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements

##### 2.1. General information and application of IFRS

###### The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted in the European Union (EU). A group management report and the obligatory disclosures to be made under German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB were added to the consolidated financial statements.

 To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of comprehensive income have been aggregated. These items are shown and explained separately in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 The presentation and the components of the consolidated financial statements comply with the rules in IAS 1.10. The consolidated statement of comprehensive income is prepared based on the nature of expense method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared based on IAS 7.

 The consolidated financial statements are prepared based on historical cost on the reporting date, 31 December 2021. Historical costs are generally based on the fair value of the consideration transferred in exchange for the asset. The fair value is the price that would be received in orderly transactions between market participants on the measurement date for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of liabilities. This applies regardless of whether the price can be directly observed or is estimated using a measurement method.

 The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (EUR k), unless otherwise indicated. Due to rounding, it is possible that figures may not add up exactly to the total stated, and the percentages presented may not precisely reflect the figures they correspond to.

 The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year. The fiscal year of the consolidated entities also corresponds to the calendar year.

 The management prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.


-----

##### 2.2. Amended standards and interpretations

###### 2.2.1 New or amended IFRS applied in the fiscal year

 The Group applied all standards and interpretations (including amendments) as adopted by the EU in its consolidated financial statements which are mandatory for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2021.

 On March 2021, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 that increases the scope of the amendment that was issued on 28 May 2020 by the IASB. This contains a practical expedient for lessees in terms of accounting for rent concessions granted by the lessor as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The practical expedient gives the lessee the option not to assess whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. EU endorsement of the amendment by the European Commission took place on 30 August 2021. This allows lessees to apply the amendments to annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021. Early application is permitted, also to financial statements not yet approved for publication on 31 March 2021. The Group did not make use of the practical expedient.

 Other amendments to standards that were mandatory from 1 January 2021 relate to amendments to IFRS 4 (insurance contracts - deferral of IFRS 9) and IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (interest rate benchmark reform - Phase 2).

 Application of the amendments did not have any effect on the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2021.

 2.2.2 New or amended IFRS not yet applied

 The following accounting standards relevant for the Group had already been issued by the IASB before the consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue, but their adoption is not yet mandatory and they have not yet been adopted by the Group and do not have any material impact on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position and performance.

##### 2.3. Principles of consolidation

###### 2.3.1 Basis of consolidation and group information

 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as of 31 December 2021. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

 • Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)

 • Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee

 • The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

 Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an


-----

###### investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

 • The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee

 • Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

 • The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

 The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non- controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

 As a general rule, subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements by way of full consolidation from the time when the Group obtained control over or the ability to control the subsidiary. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.

Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH (Austria) Vienna 100

Swiss Online Shopping AG i.L. (Switzerland) Langenthal 100

###### In fiscal year 2021, the BestSecret Group structure was simplified with economic effect as of      1 January, 2021. To this extent, Schustermann & Borenstein Holding GmbH was merged into PrestigeBidCo GmbH. Additionally, Best Secret GmbH was merged into Schustermann & Borenstein GmbH, which was then renamed Best Secret GmbH. Schustermann & Borenstein Logistik GmbH was renamed Best Secret Logistik GmbH and S&B Outlet GmbH was renamed Lawrence Grey GmbH. In addition Schustermann & Borenstein Wien GmbH was renamed Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH (Austria) in fiscal year 2022. Swiss Online Shopping AG is in liquidation. The shareholdings did not change compared to the prior year.

##### The holding company

###### The next-senior holding company of PrestigeBidCo GmbH is Best Secret Group AG (Aschheim). The former PrestigeBidCo Holding GmbH (Aschheim) changed its legal form into a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) together with the business name Best Secret Group AG with effect from 21 February 2022. The consolidated financial statements of Best Secret Group AG (smallest and largest consolidated group) are published in the electronic German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger). The ultimate holding company of Best Secret Group AG is Permira Holdings Limited (St. Peter Port, Guernsey).

 2.3.2 Consolidation methods

 Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the acquisition costs against the group share of the fair value of the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries at the time of acquisition. At this juncture, the acquisition method is used. Receivables and corresponding liabilities of group entities were offset against each other. Significant intercompany results from intra-Group service transactions were eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Sales and other income


-----

###### from intra-Group supply and service relationships were offset against the corresponding expenses. The financial statements of all subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared as of 31 December 2021.

##### 2.4. Change in accounting policies and presentation

###### Certain comparative amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of cash flows have been reclassified or re-presented, to implement the latest developments on interpretations of IFRS and to improve presentation for the users of the financial statements. As a result, the following items were subject to a change in classification during the current year:

 a. Cash in transit (see note 5.7. Trade and other receivables)

 b. Prepayments made for merchandise (see note 5.6. Inventories)

 c. Right of use asset and lease liability (see note 5.4. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities)

 d. Refund liabilities (see note 5.14. Other current financial liabilities)

 e. Accrual for outstanding invoices (see note 5.13. Trade and other payables)

 f. Debtors with credit balances (see note 5.14. Other current financial liabilities).

 Due to these changes, the revised statement of financial position as of 1 Jan 2020 and the cash flow statement 2019 have been included.

##### Change in accounting policy

###### Change in presentation to proactively disclose the latest developments on interpretations of IFRS:

 The Group reclassified balances with Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license from ‘cash and cash equivalents’ (cash in transit) to ‘trade and other receivables’ proactively reflecting current developments on interpretations of IFRS and classifies those balances as ‘other receivables’. The company believes that this change in accounting policy improves presentation of the financial position in particular cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position as well as components of the consolidated statement of cash flows.


-----

###### As a result, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 9,202k, as of 31 December 2020 EUR 8,207k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 13,268k were reclassified from ‘Cash and cash equivalents’ to ‘Trade and other receivables’ in the statement of financial position, respectively.

 Furthermore, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 9,202k, as of 31 December 2020 EUR 8,207k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 13,268k were reclassified from ‘cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December’ of the respective year to ‘Decrease/increase in trade and other receivables’ within ‘Net cash flows from operating activities’ in the consolidated statement of cash flows. ‘Net cash flows from operating activities’ changed by EUR 995k as of 31 December 2021 and EUR 5,061k as of 31 December 2020.

##### Changes in presentation

###### Change in presentation to further improve a clear and structured presentation of the consolidated financial statements:

 Prepayments made for inventories

 The Group changed the presentation of the line item ‘prepayments made’ in its consolidated statement of financial position to reflect more appropriately the economic content and further improve a clear and structured presentation. The consolidated statement of financial position line item ‘prepayments made’ was reclassified to ‘other current non-financial assets’. Comparative amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position were reclassified for consistency. As a result, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 3,524k, as of 31 December 2020 EUR 3,692k and as of     1 January 2020 EUR 6,238k were reclassified from ‘prepayments made’ to ‘other current non- financial assets’, respectively.

 Right-of-use assets and lease liability

 The Group changed the presentation of the balance sheet items related to leases to further improve a clear and structured presentation in the consolidated statement of financial position for this material topic. Consequently, ‘Right-of-use assets’ were reclassified to a separate line item in the consolidated statement of financial position from ‘property, plant and equipment’. Furthermore, ‘Non-current lease liabilities’ were reclassified to a separate line item from ‘other non-current financial liabilities’ whereas ‘current lease liabilities’ were reclassified to a separate line item from ‘other current financial liabilities’ in the consolidated statement of financial position.


-----

###### As a result, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 101,612k, as of 31 December 2020 EUR 101,342k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 87,678k were reclassified from ‘property, plant and equipment’ to ‘right-of-use assets’, respectively. Furthermore, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 107,733k, as of    31 December 2020 EUR 106,858k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 90,400k were reclassified from ‘other non-current financial liabilities’ to ‘non-current lease liabilities’, respectively. Moreover, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 8,251k, as of 31 December 2020 EUR 5,361k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 5,257k were reclassified from ‘other current financial liabilities’ to ‘current lease liabilities’.

 Refund liabilities

 The Group changed the presentation of liabilities for goods returns from customers reflecting the effective return policy. Additionally, the functionality ‘voucher for refund’ on the Best Secret website was deactivated, so that all returns are effectively refunded via payment to the customers. To appropriately reflect this, refund liabilities were reclassified from ‘other current non-financial liabilities’ to ‘other current financial liabilities’. To improve comparability, prior year amounts were reclassified in the consolidated statement of financial position. As a result, as of   31 December 2021 EUR 39,666k, as of 31 December 2020 EUR 22,377k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 18,973k were reclassified from ‘other current non-financial liabilities’ to ‘other current financial liabilities’, respectively.

 Debtors with credit balances

 The Group changed the presentation of ‘debtors with credit balances’ in its consolidated financial statements to reflect more appropriately the economic content and further improve a clear and structured presentation. Liabilities resulting from ‘debtors with credit balances’ were reclassified from ‘other current non-financial liabilities’ to ‘other current financial liabilities’. Comparative amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position were reclassified for consistency. As a result, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 122k, as of 31 December 2020 EUR 31k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 24k were reclassified from ‘other current non-financial liabilities’ to ‘other current financial liabilities’, respectively.

 Accruals for outstanding invoices for goods received and goods in transit

 The Group changed the presentation of accruals for outstanding supplier invoices for goods received and goods in transit in its consolidated financial statements to reflect more appropriately the Group’s liabilities. To increase comparativeness and consistency for comparative periods, the accruals for outstanding supplier invoices for goods received and goods in transit were reclassified from ‘other current non-financial liabilities’ to ‘trade and other payables’. As a result, as of 31 December 2021 EUR 16,934k, as of 31 December 2020      


-----

###### EUR 8,436k and as of 1 January 2020 EUR 11,827k were reclassified from ‘other current non- financial liabilities’ to ‘trade and other payables’.

##### 2.5. Change in segment reporting

###### During 2021, the Group changed its internal organizational setup, the management structure and the internal reports submitted to the CODM. The Group has therefore realigned its segment reporting. The reportable segments in prior periods were “Online” and “Stationary retail business”. For fiscal year 2021 and thereafter, the Group segments will be “Germany” and “International”. Accordingly, prior year comparatives in the segment reporting have been adjusted retrospectively (see note 6.3.).

##### 2.6. Use of estimates and assumptions

###### The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that have effects on the amounts carried and the related disclosures. Although these estimates are based on the current events and measures to the best of management’s knowledge, there may be deviations between estimated and actual results. Significant estimates and assumptions have been used for the following matters in particular:

 • Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID-19 impact)

 • Determination and assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes

 • The determination of provisions for restoration expenses and other provisions

 • Assumptions for the calculation of returns and unredeemed coupons

 • Inventory valuation

 • Segment reporting

 • Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables

 • Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16

 • Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16


-----

###### • Assumptions with regard to useful live of the Group’s customer base due to the structural shift towards e-commerce

 These key forward-looking assumptions and estimates, which involve a significant risk of changing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year, are discussed below.

 2.6.1 Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID-19 impact)

 All non-financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are tested for impairment if there are indicators that the asset may be impaired. Regardless of indicators of impairment, goodwill acquired in business combinations is tested for impairment once a year at the level of the cash- generating unit to which the asset belongs.

 This assessment implies significant judgment and estimates, in particular in light of the uncertainties in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the shift to the online market business in general, and this was taken into account in the impairment testing for goodwill and the review of useful lives for the intangible assets recognized using the purchase method in compliance with IFRS 3. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. This is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model that is the basis for the calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal used as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant to goodwill. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 5.1.

 2.6.2 Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes

 Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for prior years. Various factors such as past experience with tax field audits and different treatment of tax regulations by tax authorities are considered.

 Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profit. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainty. Consequently, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of


-----

###### deferred tax assets recognized at the reporting date. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the income statement.

 2.6.3 Determination of provisions for restorations expenses and other provisions

 The determination of provisions for restoration expenses requires assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rates, expected costs and timing of these costs. If the interest effect resulting from the discounting is significant, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.

 Provisions mainly comprise provisions for restoration expenses and provisions for restructuring. Whether a present obligation is probable or not requires judgment. The nature and type of risks for these provisions differ, and management’s judgment is applied regarding the nature and extent of obligations in deciding if an outflow of resources is probable or not.

 As of 31 December 2021, long-term provisions were discounted at an interest rate of 7.5% (prior year: 7.5%). In the case of discounting, timing-related interest effects are recognized as financial expenses. Further details are described in note 5.11.

 2.6.4 Calculation of returns and unredeemed gift vouchers

 Returns

 For transactions with a statutory 14-day or longer refund policy, the Group calculates the amount of the expected returns as of the reporting date based on historical return rates under consideration of the actual returns until the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements, which are taken into account in order to reduce revenue. As of 31 December 2021, deferred sales amounted to EUR 39,666k (prior year: EUR 22,377k). The right to recover possession of expected returns is reported under other current non-financial assets.

 Unredeemed gift vouchers

 The acquiring customer has a claim from the sale of vouchers for fulfillment up to a period of three years. If vouchers sold are not redeemed within this period, the Group realizes the revenue from the voucher sale. Liabilities from the sale of gift vouchers are recognized under other liabilities and amounted as of 31 December 2021 to EUR 1,983k (prior year: EUR 1,723k).


-----

###### 2.6.5 Inventory valuation

 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary costs to make the sale. Estimates are necessary to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. Further details are given in note 5.6.

 2.6.6 Segment reporting

 IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) of the Group for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the respective segments. In prior periods, the Group has reported in two segments: “Online” and “Stationary retail business”. In recent years, the Group has been able to leverage the accelerated structural shift to e-commerce and set a clear focus on online business. This transition has resulted in a change in the internal organizational setup, the management structure, and the internal reporting lines. As the internal organizational and management structure and the internal reports submitted to the CODM form the basis for determining the segment reporting format of the Group, the Group has therefore realigned its segment reporting. For fiscal year 2021 and thereafter, the Group segments will be “Germany” and “International”. Primary emphasis is placed on the key performance indicators revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The recognition and measurement methods of the reportable segments correspond to the consolidated recognition and measurement methods described in note 6.3.

 2.6.7 Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables

 The determination of the necessity and amount of valuation allowances on receivables requires assumptions and estimates regarding the credit risk and underlying time intervals. In the case of a return debit, the Company informs the customer and defines a period for payment. When the defined time period has elapsed, written warnings are sent to the customers. Further details are given in note 5.7. and note 5.17.

 The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due and the Group’s historical default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on expectations as to the collectability of the receivables.


-----

###### 2.6.8 Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16

 The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering the debt structure of the Group and the useful life of the leased assets. To measure lease liabilities the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group estimates the incremental borrowing rate by using observable input factors.

 2.6.9 Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16

 The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering the overall business development as well as the term of existing leases.

 2.6.10 Assumptions with regard to useful live of the Group’s customer base

 In general, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the structural shift towards e-commerce. Testing the useful lives at the end of 2020 showed the need for prospective adjustment of the remaining useful life of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base from the remaining 10 years to 5 years from the 2021 reporting period onwards. This change in estimate of the useful live as such caused an increase of the annual amortization of EUR 6,640k.

##### 2.7. Business combinations and goodwill

###### Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

 When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date.

 Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.


-----

###### After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. In case of any structural changes of the respective CGUs within the Group, an impairment review and potential reallocation of the Goodwill according to IAS 36 is performed. More detailed information on impairment testing can be found in note 5.1.

##### 2.8. Current and non-current portions

###### The group classifies its assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position as current and non- current assets or liabilities.

 An asset is classified as current when:

 • it is expected to be realized, or intended to be sold or consumed, within the normal operating cycle,

 • it is expected to be realized within 12 months after the reporting period or

 • it is cash or a cash equivalent, unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for a period of at least 12 months.

 All other assets are classified as non-current.

 A liability is classified as current if:

 • it is expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle,

 • it is expected to be realized within 12 months of the end of the reporting period or

 • the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

 All other liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current assets or liabilities.


-----

##### 2.9. Fair value measurement

###### The Group applies measurement techniques that are appropriate under the respective circumstances and for which sufficient data is available for fair value measurement. In the process, observable market inputs are to be preferred to non-observable inputs.

 Assets and liabilities measured or presented at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are classified on the basis of the following fair value hierarchy. The classification uses the input parameters of the lowest category that is material to the fair value measurement.

 • Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

 • Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly

 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the assets and liabilities

##### 2.10. Revenue recognition

###### The Group recognizes revenue according to IFRS 15 at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods to the customers, net of taxes and duties, and taking into account agreed payment terms. Revenue is reported net of discounts, rebates, taxes and returns. Since the Group has price discretion in its sales transactions and also bears the inventory and credit risk, the Group generally acts as a principal and is therefore the principal party of all sales transactions.

 In addition, the Group purchases some products, such as jewelry, on a commission basis. In this case, the Group is acting as an agent, but is free in the setting of prices. Revenue is recognized net of commissions earned.

 Revenue recognition requires the fulfillment of the following recognition criteria:

##### Sale of goods and products

###### The Group’s contracts with customers for the sale of merchandise generally include a single performance obligation. The Group has concluded that revenue from the sale of merchandise should be recognized at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. In the stationary retail business, revenue is therefore recognized upon handing over the goods and in online trading upon delivery of the goods to the customer.


-----

##### Accounting treatment of returns in the online business

###### Under IFRS 15, the consideration received from the customer is variable because the contract allows the customer to return the products. The Group uses the expected value method to estimate the merchandise that will be returned, because this method predicts most accurately the amount of variable consideration to which the Group will be entitled. The Group applies the requirements in IFRS 15 on constraining estimates of variable consideration such as return rate to determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. The Group presents a refund liability (other current financial liabilities) and an asset (other current non- financial assets) for the right to recover possession of goods from a customer separately in the statement of financial position, taking into account the costs incurred for processing the return and the losses resulting from disposing of these goods. The Group presents the expected returns of goods on a gross basis in the statement of comprehensive income and reduces revenue by the full amount of sales that it estimates to be returned. The dispatch of goods that is recorded in full when they are shipped is then corrected by the estimated value of the returns. Generally, the Group allows goods to be returned within a period of 14 days of receipt. Longer periods may be agreed upon contractually.

##### Friends recommend friends – loyalty program

###### The Group has implemented a recommendation program for customers. Every time the invitee (recommended customer) places an order, the inviting customer (inviter) receives a one-time commission voucher of 10% to 20% (prior year: 10%). The inviter also receives a 5% to 7% (prior year: 5%) voucher based on the total purchases of the invitee within a period of 12 months. According to IFRS 15, both vouchers represent a payment to customers and therefore a revenue reduction when redeemed by the customer.

##### 2.11. Government grants

###### Government grants are recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the conditions for the grants are met and the grants will actually be received. Grants that relate to income and future periods must be recognized in the correct period in line with the corresponding expenses. Grants related to income that have already been received for subsequent periods must be recognized under liabilities and released on a pro rata basis in subsequent periods. Grants that accrue to the employees must be shown as a flow-through item.


-----

##### 2.12. Taxes

 Current income taxes

###### Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

 For the purpose of measuring current German taxes, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15% is applied to distributed and retained earnings and a solidarity surcharge rate of 5.5% is applied to that amount. That yields a tax rate of 15.83%. In addition, German trade tax is imposed on profits earned in Germany. The trade tax is based on the assessment rates of the various municipalities and the basic federal rate, which has been a flat rate of 3.5% according to Sec. 11 (2) GewStG [“Gewerbesteuergesetz”: German Trade Tax Act] since the corporate tax reform in 2008. The trade tax varies depending on the different assessment rates of the municipalities, but a flat rate of 11.41% is applied in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

 The profits earned by the non-German group companies are calculated on the basis of the national tax laws applicable in each country and taxed at the tax rates in effect in those countries. The country- specific tax rates range from 21 to 25%. The Group tax rate is 27.23%. Current tax expenses are calculated on the basis of the taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs from the net profit presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a result of the expenses and income that will not be taxable or that become tax-exempt in later years. The Group’s liability for current taxes is calculated on the basis of the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted in the near future.

##### Deferred taxes

###### Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

 Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:

 • Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and


-----

###### • In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

 Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except:

 • Where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the pre-tax accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

 • In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

 The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the end of the reporting period.

 Deferred income tax relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and not in the profit or loss.

 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.


-----

###### Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in profit or loss.

##### Value added tax

###### Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of value added tax (“VAT”) except:

 • If VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case VAT is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as applicable; and

 • Where receivables, payables and finance lease liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included.

 The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

##### 2.13. Foreign currencies

###### The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is also the parent company’s functional currency. That is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the statements of financial position of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

##### Foreign currency transactions and balances

###### Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date of the transaction. In determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which the Group initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the Group determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in


-----

###### foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss.

 Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.

##### Foreign operations

###### The Group has analyzed the group companies and concluded that for each company the currency of origin represents the functional currency. During consolidation, all assets and liabilities of group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the closing rate. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the respective reporting date, while equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is recognized in profit or loss.

##### 2.14. Intangible assets

###### Intangible assets acquired in the context of a business combination under IFRS 3 are recognized separately from goodwill and measured at fair value at the acquisition date. This includes customer bases and brand names. These are recognized as an intangible asset according to IAS 38, measured at fair value and amortized over their expected useful lives.

 An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.

 Intangible assets which are not acquired as part of a business combination but as purchased licenses are initially recognized at cost.

 Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful life. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indications of impairment at the reporting date. The remaining useful life and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of a reporting period. If the reasons for impairment have been eliminated, a reversal to a maximum of the historical cost is set as the upper limit. Required changes in the amortization


-----

###### period and method are treated as changes in estimates. Impairment losses on intangible assets, e.g., customer base and brand names, with finite useful lives are included in amortization within selling expenses.

2019. At the same time, the total useful life of the customer base “Schustermann & Borenstein” was reduced from 20 years to 14 years. Reviewing
the useful lives at the end of 2021 showed the need for prospective alignment of the remaining useful life of the respective customer bases to 3
years from the 2022 reporting period onwards. This reduces the total useful life for the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base accordingly to
8 years.

###### In the case of internally generated intangible assets, IAS 38 makes a distinction between the research phase and the development phase. Costs incurred during the research phase cannot be capitalized; instead they must be recognized as an expense. On the other hand, costs incurred during the development phase must be capitalized, provided that the reporting entity demonstrably fulfills all six criteria set out in IAS 38.57 et seq. The Group primarily develops key components of software (Best Secret website and the Best Secret app as well as expenses for the Group’s other IT-systems and infrastructure) used by the Group. A useful life of 4 to 5 years is assumed for development activities in connection with the software.

##### 2.15. Property, plant and equipment

###### Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost and depreciated in accordance with their expected useful life using the straight-line method. The Group treats changes in the residual values or useful lives that arise during use as a change in estimates. Depreciation is charged over the following useful lives.

**Total useful life in years**

Leasehold improvements 6-20

Plant and machinery 5-14

Furniture and fixtures 5-23

###### An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on


-----

###### derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized.

 The residual values, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. If the carrying amount of a tangible asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized, in addition to systematic depreciation, in order to lower the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (net selling price) and the present value of the net cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset. Whenever possible, the net selling price is derived from the most recently observed market transactions.

##### 2.16. Inventories

###### Merchandise accounted for as inventories is recognized at cost pursuant to IAS 2. Cost is calculated on the basis of an item-by-item measurement, factoring in the additions from the point of view of the sourcing market or on the basis of the moving average price of the goods. Incidental acquisition costs are generally measured on a monthly basis. Supplier payments that are to be classified as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of inventories. Consumption of inventories is recognized within the costs of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.

 Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The net realizable value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. Adequate write- downs to net realizable value were made to allow for all risks from slow-moving goods and/or reduced saleability. When the circumstances that previously caused merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist, the write-down is reversed.

##### 2.17. Impairment of non-financial assets

###### The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset reported in the statement of financial position may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing is required, the Group carries out an impairment test. Further details are given in note 5.1.


-----

##### 2.18. Cash and cash equivalents

###### Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. The “Cash and cash equivalents” item in the consolidated statement of financial position comprises cash, bank balances and credit balances with Payment Service Providers with a banking license (cash in transit). In 2021, the Group reclassified credit balances with Payment Service Providers not holding a banking license from ‘cash and cash equivalents’ (cash in transit) to ‘trade and other receivables’. Prior year’s figure has been adjusted accordingly. Further details are given in note 2.4. The cash in transit balances are presented as cash equivalents as these balances are immediately credited to the bank account with the payment service providers over which the company has direct power of disposal.

 For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, the cash and cash equivalents defined above are presented less overdraft facilities that have been drawn, as these are an integral part of the Group’s available cash.

##### 2.19. Leases

 The Group as a lessee

###### The Group leases various properties, equipment and vehicles. Leases are typically entered into for periods of 2 to 22 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

 Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is broken down into an interest component and a principal repayment. Interest is recognized in the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for the reporting period (effective interest method). It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

 The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.


-----

###### Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

 • fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable

 • renewal options

 • variable lease payments that are based on an index or an (interest) rate

 • amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees

 • the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and

 • payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

 The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee uses the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

 Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

 • the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability

 • any lease payments made at or before the commencement date

 • any initial direct costs, and

 • restoration costs.

 Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low- value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.


-----

##### The Group as lessor

###### The Group sub-lets office and retail space.

 When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

 In case of finance leases, rental income is recognized using the effective interest method over the term of the subleases and reported in interest income. Payments received from operating subleases are recognized within other operating income.

##### 2.20. Trade and other receivables

###### The “Trade and other receivables” item in the statement of financial position comprises balances with payment service providers not holding a banking license and receivables against customers.

 Trade receivables are initially recognized at the settlement-date fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is usually the original invoice value less a loss allowance for expected impairment losses. The loss allowance for trade receivables is determined based on lifetime expected credit losses, which are calculated as the present value of expected cash shortfalls. Changes are recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

 For its online customers, the Group offers the option to purchase on account. In connection with this payment option, the Group works with a factoring provider, transferring substantially all risks and rewards resulting from the receivables to the factoring company and derecognizing receivables in the statement of financial position.

##### 2.21. Other financial assets

###### Other financial assets are initially recognized on the settlement date. The Group classifies its financial assets as “at amortized cost”. No financial assets are held “at fair value through profit or loss” or “at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)” on the reporting date. At initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.


-----

###### Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount, are measured “at amortized cost”. A gain or loss on such an instrument subsequently measured at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is sold or impaired. Interest income from this type of financial asset is included in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.

 Credit risks related to debt instruments at amortized cost held by the Group at the reporting date are considered to be low. Therefore, the regular approach in accordance with IFRS 9 requires the Group to determine, at inception as well as on an ongoing basis during the lifetime of the debt instrument, the allowance as the credit losses expected in the next 12 months. If the credit risk were to increase and no longer be regarded as low-risk, lifetime expected credit losses would have to be recognized. The Group considers credit risk as significantly increased if debt instruments are past due for more than 30 days. For trade receivables, a separate approach is applied for measuring impairment (see 2.19, 5.7 and 5.17.).

 Other financial assets are included in other current financial assets, except for those with maturity dates more than 12 months after the reporting date, which are presented as non-current financial assets.

##### 2.22. Financial liabilities

###### Financial liabilities are recognized when a group company is a contractual party to a financial instrument on the settlement date. Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the duration of the obligation using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount upon initial recognition.

 The embedded prepayment option for the Notes is considered to be closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. The Group defines “closely related” up to a 5% difference between amortized cost and redemption price as of the redemption date.

 Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade and other payables and other liabilities, are measured at amortized cost. Trade and other payables are amounts owed as


-----

###### consideration for goods or services provided to the Group in the normal course of business including amounts owed to a payment service provider governing the settlement of supplier liabilities. In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are therefore classified as current; otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or nominal value.

 The Group derecognizes a financial liability when the related obligation has been paid, canceled or has expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized financial liability and the consideration received or due is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.

##### 2.23. Provisions

###### Provisions are recognized in accordance with IAS 37 when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

 A best estimate is made of the amount of the provisions, taking into consideration all the discernible risks arising from the obligation. This refers to the amount that is most likely needed to settle the liability. Provisions with a residual term of more than one year are discounted on the reporting date.

 Provisions for restoration obligations

 The Group recognizes provisions for restoration obligations for leasehold improvements in the leased warehouses and office buildings. The provision is recognized at an amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated future restoration obligations. The restoration obligations are recognized as part of the cost of the leasehold improvements at the corresponding amount. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is commensurate to the maturity and risk profile. The unwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and recognized as an interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income.

 Provisions for restructuring measures

 Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized to the extent that decisions by management have been announced in sufficient detail to those affected as of the reporting date. The definition


-----

###### of a restructuring measure includes for example basic reorganization with significant effects on the focus of business activities.

##### 2.24. Share-based payment

###### Certain executives and executive management (“managers”) were given the opportunity to invest in different German limited partnerships, which indirectly own interests of approximately 5% in the Group. The subscription price for the partnership interests subscribed by the managers in the limited partnership corresponded to their fair value at grant date.

 The acquisition qualifies as a share-based payment under IFRS 2, and the managers’ interests in the limited partnership are recognized as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement in the financial statements. As the investments in the partnership were acquired at fair value, no expense is recognized as a result of this transaction. The participation rights in form of partnership interests were acquired from an entity outside the Group, and the Group has no obligation to make any payments on the partnership interests to the managers. The share-based payment arrangements are fully vested at grant date. The sales constitute a performance vesting condition that is considered a non-market performance condition. If the service condition is met, then the manager can exercise his or her option at the market value per share. The investment program provides for various industry-standard cancellation and settlement events.

##### 2.25. Significant events after the reporting date

###### In 2021, BestSecret Group began simplifying its corporate structure and renaming companies using “BestSecret” as only brand and group name. On February 21, 2022, the next step in this process was made by converting the German parent company, PrestigeBidCo Holding GmbH, from a financial holding into an active functional holding in the form of a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) and renaming it Best Secret Group AG.

 Further advances in the simplification and harmonization of the Group structure included the transfer of all shares of Best Secret Logistik GmbH and Lawrence Grey GmbH to PrestigeBidCo GmbH on January 24, 2022, and the renaming of Schustermann & Borenstein Wien GmbH to Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH with effect from March 14, 2022.

 In the context of our continued growth and internationalization, Best Secret Poland Sp. z o.o. was established on February 18, 2022. Its shares are held by PrestigeBidCo GmbH (99%) and Best Secret GmbH (1%). Best Secret Poland will operate an additional fulfillment center for the Group which is currently being planned. In addition, Best Secret Hellas S.M. S.A. was established on


-----

###### March 15, 2022. Its shares are held by Best Secret GmbH. The company is located in Ioannina in the northeastern part of Greece and will mainly be used as a tech hub.

 The large-scale conflict in Europe resulting from the Russian invasion of the Ukraine in late February 2022 will potentially have a wide range of supply chain implications, including increases in the costs and disruption in freight transport. It can also have a negative impact and creates uncertainty on our operations as both our planned logistics center and our existing returns service provider are located in Poland. Shortage of labor, labor cost inflation and delivery delays may negatively impact our order fulfillment operations as well as causing selling and distribution costs increase. On the demand side, further inflationary pressure would impact consumers’ purchasing power and the instability of the general security situation and growing uncertainty, including prices volatility, could further adversely affect consumer confidence and consumer spending. We are monitoring potential risks and mitigating measures that would need to be taken. The development of events is subject to considerable uncertainty and as such the impact on our business will be monitored and assessed going forward.

### 3. Capital management

###### The Group analyses its capital based on the equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, including all components of equity as shown on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximize the value of the Group.

 It is the objective of the capital management of the Group to ensure amongst other things that it meets the financial covenants attached to the Notes (see note 5.12.), which define leverage ratio thresholds. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the banks to immediately call loans and borrowings. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions. The Group monitors capital using both a leverage ratio and an interest ratio, which is Net Debt*/Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA/Interest Expense respectively as of particular effective date. According to the Offering Memorandum Agreement, the Group’s policy is to keep the leverage ratio well below the level 5:1 and the interest ratio above 2:1 and to reduce net debt over time. The Group achieved these targets in 2021 and in the prior year.

 No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the reporting period ended 31 December 2021.

- Net debt consists of the Notes, accrued interest on the Notes and interest-bearing liabilities, which also include recognized lease liabilities less
cash and cash equivalents.

###### The Group carried out development work to create software and app solutions. All non- capitalizable development costs are recognized as administrative expenses in the reporting period in which they are incurred. In 2021, this expense amounted to EUR 13,562k (prior year: EUR 6,776k).

 The state financial support related to COVID-19, in particular government-subsidized short-term work allowances, reduced personnel expenses by EUR 2,684k in the 2021 reporting period (prior year: EUR 2,469k).

 Amortization and impairment in the 2021 reporting period includes an expense of EUR 494k on software no longer used (prior year: EUR 2,801k).

###### To conduct the impairment test, the total carrying amount of the cash-generating units is compared against the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the fair value less costs of disposal, based on discounted future cash flows. Expected cash flows are determined based on a suitable planning process. Internal information and external macroeconomic indicators are taken into consideration. The current detailed planning period covers four years. Generally, a growth rate of 2.0% to 2.5% (see table above) is applied for the time after the detailed planning period. As a general rule, the discount factor is calculated as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) by application of the capital asset pricing model. For

###### this purpose, a peer group is used for all groups of cash-generating units operating in the same business segment. The beta factor is calculated annually based on freely available market data. For both CGUs the same beta factor was applied. A country risk premium was applied for the CGU International in addition.

 Furthermore, the discount factors are determined on the basis of the following exemplary assumptions: a base interest rate of 0.1% (prior year: -0.2%) and a market risk premium of 7.5% (prior year: 7.5%) as of 31 December 2021 in Germany. Country-specific risk premiums are applied to both the equity cost rate and the debt capital cost rate, based on the credit rating of the respective country.

 For the purposes of estimating the development of revenues, EBITDA margin, specific growth rates were assumed in conducting the impairment test of the respective CGUs. Furthermore, customary market EBITDA margin were assumed for calculating sustainable earnings.

 The annual impairment test as of 31 December 2021 confirmed the recoverability of the capitalized goodwill for the CGU ‘Online’ and Germany and International respectively.

 In addition to the impairment test, three sensitivity analyses were conducted for both the Online cash- generating unit and the Germany and International. For the first sensitivity analysis, the discount factor was increased by 0.5 percentage points (prior year: 0.5 percentage points). For the second sensitivity analysis, a flat-rate deduction of 10% (prior year: 10%) was applied to the assumed EBITDA margin in perpetuity. The third sensitivity analysis included a reduction of the growth rate in terminal value by 0.5 percentage points. These changes in the underlying assumptions did not lead to the need to recognize any impairment loss for the Online, Germany or International cash-generating unit.

 Leases as lessor

 The Group sub-lets office and retail space. All sub-leases are classified as finance sub‑lease.

 In 2021, the Group has sub-leased office space that has been presented as part of a right-of-use asset. Consequently, the Group recognized a gain of EUR 49k (prior year: EUR 0k) on derecognition of the right of-use asset.

 In 2021, the Group recognized interest income on lease receivables of EUR 23k (prior year: EUR 25k).

###### The Group uses a provision matrix in order to measure the expected credit losses on trade receivables from individuals, which comprise a very large number of small balances. When calculating the expected credit losses, non-representative individual cases (receivables from wholesale customers) are excluded. The impairment is calculated individually for those individual cases. The table above shows both the expected credit losses from receivables from individuals and for individual cases.

 Details on the credit risk from trade receivables are included in note 5.17. The control and measurement of credit quality in connection with trade receivables is also explained there.

###### In December 2016, PrestigeBidCo GmbH (as the original borrower and original guarantor), Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and UniCredit Bank AG, London Branch (as lenders), UniCredit Bank AG, London branch (as facility agent) and UniCredit Bank AG, London branch (as security agent) entered into a revolving credit facility agreement providing for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of EUR 35,000k on a committed basis (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility in euro, Swiss francs, US dollars, pounds sterling or certain other currencies (if agreed) by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of Letters of Credit (upon the appointment of an Issuing Bank) and by way of any Ancillary Facilities that may be made available thereunder (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Borrowings are available to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) including, without limitation, for payment of interest under the Notes. On 20 December 2018, PrestigeBidCo GmbH established an additional revolving credit facility of EUR 15,000k by way of increase of the existing facility to EUR 50,000k. The additional facility lender is UniCredit Bank AG, London branch. On 2 January 2019, the lender confirmed the granting of the additional facility. Utilizations under the Additional Facility may only be used for financing or refinancing the working capital requirements and/or general corporate purposes of PrestigeBidCo GmbH and its Restricted Subsidiaries. The term of the Additional Facility is valid until further notice. The Additional Facility ranks pari passu with the existing facility.

###### The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, financial assets (current and non-current), bank balances and cash as well as trade and other payables, lease liabilities and financial liabilities (current) equal their fair values, as they are mainly short term. The fair value of the interest bearing loans and borrowings (Senior Secured Notes) are disclosed separately in the table below.

 The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair values. Financial instruments with fair value measurement based on quoted prices in active markets are disclosed in Level 1. In Level 2, determination of fair values is based on observable inputs, e.g., foreign exchange rates. Level 3 comprises financial instruments for which the fair value measurement is based on unobservable inputs.

##### Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments

###### The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise a Senior Secured Notes as well as trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables as well as cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.

 The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Group treasury oversees these risks. The Group’s senior management is supported by group treasury with advice on financial risks for the Group. The Management Board reviews and agrees processes for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.

##### Market risk

###### Market risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk.

 The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as of 31 December 2021. The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net liabilities, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the liabilities and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on: the carrying values of provisions, the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

 The sensitivity analyses demonstrate how profit or loss items are affected by the assumed changes in respective market risks. Based on the position as of 31 December 2021, there is no sensitivity of equity.

 Interest rate risk

 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. As of 31 December 2021, there are no financial instruments affected by floating interest rates. The Group does not enter into interest rate derivatives.


-----

###### Foreign currency risk

 Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates is insignificant.

##### Credit risk and risk concentration

###### Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.

 Concentration risks arising from the delivery of goods to major customers are subject to a special credit watch. In the case of a return debit, the Group has implemented a dunning process operated by an external service provider. The maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking account of any collateral, is represented by their carrying amount. The Group offers under certain conditions purchase on account. Due to the introduction of non-recourse factoring, there is no exposure to credit risk.

 The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade and other receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group does not hold collateral as security. There were no significant credit risks or concentration of risk as of 31 December 2021.

 Financial instruments and cash deposits

 Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance with the conditions specified in the Offering Memorandum. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties that meet the requirements set out in the Offering Memorandum and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. The limits are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through a counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.

##### Liquidity risk

###### The Group provides sufficient liquidity for each individual entity by cash pooling. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank loans. As of 31 December 2021, roughly 10% (prior year: 10%) of the undiscounted cash outflows from financial liabilities are due in less than one year. The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.


-----

###### The Group has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding, and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders. The Group has access to a short-term loan of EUR 50,000k. The facility had not yet been utilized as of the reporting date.

 Segment reporting

###### The Group changed its internal organizational setup, the management structure and the internal reports submitted to the CODM. The Group has therefore realigned its segment reporting.

Accordingly, prior year comparatives in the segment reporting have been adjusted retrospectively.


-----

###### As of 31 December 2021, non-current assets (excluding financial assets) of EUR 586,753k (prior year: EUR 688,434k) are located in Germany and EUR 78,272k (prior year: EUR 29,232k) are located in other countries.

 Management measures the performance of the segments on the basis of revenues and adjusted EBITDA.

That means that adjusted EBITDA equals the EBITDA excluding restructuring and reorganization costs, non-operational items and non-recurring or extraordinary items.

 There are no intersegment transactions in the internal reporting structure. No information on segment assets or liabilities is available or relevant for decision-making. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.

_International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial_
_law pursuant to Section 315e para. 1 of the HGB, as well as the group management report, prepared on the basis of the_
_HGB, of PrestigeBidCo GmbH, Aschheim, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a whole and not solely to_
_the consolidated financial statements presented in this Offering Memorandum on the preceding pages. The group_
_management report is not part of this Offering Memorandum._

# Independent auditor’s report

###### To PrestigeBidCo GmbH

### Opinions

###### We have audited the consolidated financial statements of PrestigeBidCo GmbH, Aschheim and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2021, the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated statements of cash flows and the consolidated statements of changes in equity for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2021 and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of PrestigeBidCo GmbH for the fiscal year from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.

 In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit

 • the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2021 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2021, and

 • the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

 Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

### Basis for the opinions

###### We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer
 [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and


-----

###### principles are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the Group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

### Other information

###### The executive directors are responsible for the other information, which probably will be provided after the issuance of our audit opinion. The other information comprises the Annual Bond Report 2021, but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited parts of the group management report and not our audit opinion.  

 Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

 In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information

 • is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

 • otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

### Responsibilities of the executive directors for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report 

###### The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial  statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB
 [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code] and, that the consolidated financial  statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable


-----

###### the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

 Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

### Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report

###### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

 Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.


-----

###### We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

 • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

 • Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB
 [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code].

 • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the


-----

###### direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.

 • Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

 • Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

 The key audit partner responsible for the audit is Josef Christ.
