Our non-IFRS financial measures are defined by us as set out below. We define “EBITDA” as net income/(net loss) for the period before income taxes, financial income, financial expenses, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and the reversal of impairment losses, each as shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA adjusted for restructuring and reorganization costs, new store opening, extension store/fulfillment center and improvement expenses, introduction/improvement of tools and processes expenses and COVID-19 pandemic/geopolitical tensions related expenses. We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. There is no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. We define “Capital Expenditure” as the sum of: (i) purchase of property, plant and equipment, (ii) purchase of intangible assets and (iii) capitalized development costs each as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We define “Operating **Net Working Capital” as the sum of (i) inventories and prepayments for inventories, (ii) trade and other receivables, (iii) trade and other payables and (iv) others. ‘Others’ includes refund liabilities and assets for the right to recover possession of goods for expected returns. We define “Operating Free Cash Flow” as EBITDA plus the changes in net foreign exchange differences, increase/decrease in other liabilities and provisions, decrease/increase in other assets, decrease/increase in trade and other receivables, decrease/increase in inventories and similar assets, increase/decrease in trade payables and other liabilities each as shown in net cash flows from operating activities (changes in current assets, non-current financial assets, current and non-current liabilities presented in net cash flows from operating activities), minus payment of lease liabilities as shown in net cash flows from financing activities and minus Capital Expenditure. We define “Cash Conversion” as the ratio between Operating Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA. For a reconciliation of our net income/net loss for the period to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of Operating Free Cash Flow and Cash Conversion, see “Summary Consolidated Financial and _Other Information.” For a reconciliation and description of Capital Expenditure and Operating Net Working_ Capital, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We present non-IFRS financial measures because we believe that they are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating result as reported under IFRS. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. Non-IFRS financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net income/ net loss for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. The non-IFRS financial measures may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. The non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are: ----- - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; - although amortization, depreciation and write-downs are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS financial measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made.

We provide our customers with exclusive access to a portfolio of around 3,000 brands, while offering our brand partners a structural solution to sell their overstock through a discreet and controlled channel and protecting their brand equity. With a heritage going back nearly 100 years, we have evolved from an offline retail business to a tech-driven online platform. We offer a wide range of midmarket to luxury fashion brands at attractive discounts ranging from 20% to 80%, providing a permanent assortment of approximately 250,000 items at any moment in time. Our online offering is available in multiple languages and in 27 European countries. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €996.3 million, an Adjusted EBITDA of €131.4 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.2%. Our online revenue, which accounted for 91.7% of total revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, grew at a CAGR of 41.2% from the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 to the twelve months ended March 31, 2022. While 70.1% of our revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 was generated in Germany, our international business outside of Germany continues to gain in importance relative to our Germany business and experienced strong revenue growth of 86.3% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 (with a CAGR of 62.2% from the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 to the twelve months ended March 31, 2022).",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,560,PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,560.2,Strengths,560.2.1,Our business operates successfully in a large and resilient market with long-term growth supported by structural tailwinds,"We operate in the European online fashion market (excluding Russia and the United Kingdom) for mid-market to luxury brands, primarily in the dedicated online off-price and discounted in-season and end-of-season sectors. By targeting the online off-price sector, we are well-positioned to take advantage of three structural long-term trends in the fashion sector: (1) disproportional demand growth in the off-price market, expected to grow at 5% per year from 2021-2025, (2) a shift to more premium fashion, with the mid-market to luxury fashion market expected to grow at 4% per year from 2021-2025 and (3) rising online penetration in the European fashion market, expected to grow at 9% per year from 2021-2025 (source: a leading international consultancy firm, Company Analysis). The growing importance of sustainability for consumers and brands makes the off-price sector an increasingly attractive choice for brands, as it allows for overstock, a structural phenomenon in the fashion industry, to be monetized in a sustainable manner, at discounted prices to consumers and thus avoiding the destruction or disposal of such overstock in landfills. Our closed-membership model offers brands the additional value of discreet overstock clearing at scale and we believe it presents a unique business opportunity to build upon the growing importance of sustainability. As a result of the above factors, and as illustrated in the chart below, the online off-price sector amounted to €44 billion in revenue across Europe (excluding the U.K. and Russia) in 2021, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% from 2021 to 2025 (source: a leading international consultancy firm, Company Analysis). 1 ----- (1) All market sizes refer to 2021 and continental Europe, excl.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,560,PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,560.2,Strengths,560.2.2,The most powerful flywheel in online fashion,"The “flywheel” that drives our growth and profitability is the result of several strong elements that feed into one another and that accelerate our viral engine. First, we develop strong brand relationships as a result of our closed and discreet model that allows us to “silently” clear our brand partners’ overstock at scale. Second, based on our strong brand relationships we are able to offer our members a current and attractive assortment of highly desirable brands at discounts ranging from 20% to 80%. Third, we believe this in turn, leads to our members preferring to shop with us, as reflected by exceptional customer key performance indicators (“KPIs”). In combination, these three favorable elements lead to a continuous acceleration of our “viral engine” in which existing members make use of their invitation rights to invite their families and friends. As a consequence, the “flywheel” has generated low double-digit top line growth every year, thereby attracting new brand partners and reinforcing relationships with existing brand partners. Our viral engine has contributed to an exponential growth engine as illustrated in the chart below. (1) Online revenue evolution prior to introduction of performance marketing in 2021. Financials from 2017 to 2020 in accordance with IFRS, German GAAP prior to 2017. 2) 2021. Online only. 3) Based on survey results in the DACH region (n = 1,059 respondents). Share of respondents stating “I like BestSecret and I want my friends and family to be able to get to know it, too”. Question: “What is your main motivation to invite family and friends to join BestSecret”. Source: Company To complement our “viral engine”, we introduced our new paid customer acquisition strategy in the second quarter of 2021. Paid marketing efforts allow us to invite potential new members in a targeted manner to join our closed membership model who can then make use of their invitation rights to invite new members, accelerating our viral 2 ----- engine. Paid marketing efforts drive our non-viral growth, especially in areas with currently low penetration (such as international markets). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operation—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—New customer acquisition” and “Our Business— Marketing—Paid customer acquisition.” Our brand partners_ Our exclusive, invitation-only membership model enables brands to discreetly clear large volumes of overstock in a premium environment entirely separate from their full-price channels. Discretion is increasingly important to brands, as overstock potentially threatens brand equity when sold openly, because the high degree of price visibility in online shopping allows customers to view full-price and discounted offerings side-by-side. We recently introduced a marketplace as part of our online platform to provide our brand partners the option to market their products within our ecosystem without us having to hold these products in our own inventory. We believe that the marketplace model will strengthen the relationship with our brand partners as it allows them to increase their direct to customer (or “DTC”) revenue through our online platform while maintaining price control. We offer brand partners to clear their overstock within a closed ecosystem. This also provides our brand partners comfort that their merchandise is not being re-sold through the grey market (i.e., channels that our brand partners have not authorized) or other channels that could harm their brand image. Thus, our discreet model protects their brand equity and fosters our long-term and deep strategic partnerships leading to direct relationships with around 95% of all our brand partners, thereby avoiding intermediaries. Our model has also resulted in high brand partner retention: we have retained all of our top 50 brand partners from 2017 (excluding intermediaries, private label suppliers and suppliers who went out of business). These strong relationships allow us to offer attractive products at desirable prices, which in turn, allow us to provide our brand partners with access to an affluent and loyal customer base. _Our products, prices and services_ Our superior brand proposition in turn leads to our ability to offer highly desirable products at attractive prices to our customers and provide them with a service experience matching that of full-price online platforms. Our brand proposition and the resulting strong relationships ensure that we are able to secure an attractive brand portfolio of around 3,000 brands, comprising approximately 250,000 articles at any given time. Unlike almost all other online platforms in the off-price segment, our offered assortment is broad and available permanently: we do not rely on flash sales campaigns with long delivery times. Furthermore, our customers benefit from a fresh assortment: the majority of our inventory has been listed on our online platform for less than six months. This desirable assortment is complemented by attractive discounts of 20% to 80% on every single article and a fast delivery time of approximately 3 days on average in 2021. Our online platform is accessible to our customers through our highly rated app and website which offers a highend shopping and service experience on par with leading online full-price platforms, resulting in high customer satisfaction and an excellent net promoter score (“NPS”) of approximately 60 at the end of 2021. As the fashion market and its consumers increasingly make sustainability a driver of their purchasing decisions, we expect that they will increasingly turn to us for their fashion needs, as our model allows customers a chance to shop fashion in one of the most sustainable ways by giving them access to overstock and ensuring that every piece of fashion that is produced is worn. _Our customers_ Our desirable products, prices and service in turn attract a customer base that is active, loyal, and earns above average disposable income. Driven by our broad offering and incentivized by our attractive loyalty scheme, our customer base has been growing steadily. Our number of active customers was approximately 1.2 million, 1.5 million and 2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and 2.5 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, representing a CAGR of 38% between 2019 and 2021. Revenue by customer cohort, grouped by year, or customers who joined in a given year, typically stays stable during the first year of membership. For example, online revenue from our active customers from the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 changed in the respective subsequent years to 99% (2019), 96% (2020) and 118% (2021). Our strong revenue retention track record is further illustrated by the following revenue by cohort chart: 3 ----- (1) Revenue retention is defined as online revenue (NMV after returns incl. shipping income, but excluding cut-off effects and commission) of existing customers divided by revenue of previous year. ‘Existing customers’ defined as customers with first order in previous year. Source: Company. We believe our value proposition caters to a highly attractive customer demographic, especially to affluent consumers, which drives our strong revenue retention rate, that has increased from 100% to 118% in the period between the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2021. Spend in the fashion industry is heavily skewed toward the most affluent consumer demographic: in Germany for instance, 70% of total fashion spending is made by 30% of the consumers (source: a leading international consultancy firm). These affluent consumers spend more than €1,000 per year on fashion. The off-price market is inherently attractive to affluent consumers. These consumers’ spend is approximately 2.5x more than the average consumer on fashion overall, and 2.4x more in premium, 2.7x more in affordable luxury and 2.9x more in luxury, when compared to the market average (source: a leading international consultancy firm). _Viral engine_ Our “viral engine” is a self-reinforcing model in which existing members invite their friends, colleagues or other acquaintances, thus creating multiple new customers. These new members then repeat the cycle, allowing a single original customer to lead to substantial growth over time. New “viral customers” are the primary drivers of our year-on-year structural revenue growth and an important driver for our expansion. Our viral engine resulted in our online business revenue growing at a CAGR of 22% from 2016 to 2020, after which time we introduced our paid customer acquisition strategy in the second quarter of 2021. Moreover, the viral engine is highly cost-efficient, with a low single-digit percentage of total revenue being spent annually to incentivize customers to invite other customers. The overall effect of this viral model is substantial, with four new active customers generated by ten active customers in 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

To provide for an engaging online storefront, we have designed attractive websites and one of the best-rated online fashion apps (4.8* average app rating), which we regularly update to match the high expectations of our customer base and the experience offered by full-price platforms. Our customers enjoy access to a multi-device shopping experience from their mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers that we believe allows for a convenient and frictionless shopping experience. Our technology supports all major online and mobile platforms, including dedicated iOS and Android applications for both smartphones and tablets. We program, develop and maintain our apps and website in-house, and we frequently update our applications to offer new features.

We believe that we operate a state-of-the-art cloud-based data infrastructure, which allows key business data to be readily accessible across our business units to ensure faster, more data-driven decision making. Data analysts, data scientists and data engineers are embedded across all business units, ensuring that the data we produce and analyze is put to its best use.

Our unique proposition provides us with the opportunity to continuously capture market share and participate in the structural growth momentum of our market. We believe that we have developed a proven expansion strategy that will allow us to expand into new international markets and increase penetration in our existing markets: (1) targeting and prioritizing future growth markets, (2) localizing our offering for specific markets, (3) using performance marketing campaigns to establish a customer base and (4) achieving viral customer acquisition that leads to selfreinforcing growth.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Through our marketplace model, we offer our brand partners to market their products on our BestSecret online platform without having BestSecret to hold these products as own inventory. The marketplace model will allow our brand partners to increase their DTC revenue through our online platform. We expect to achieve full scale operation of our marketplace model in the second half of 2022. Through the expansion of our marketplace offering, we aim to expand our assortment through acquiring new brand partners in the luxury segment and further grow the end of season fashion segment on BestSecret. We view the marketplace as a unique growth opportunity. There are no existing online off-price marketplaces at scale in the sector and we aim to become the number one fashion marketplace for off-price fashion in Europe.

This consolidation is predicted to be driven by brands reducing the number of their distribution partners, the increasing 8 ----- professionalization of the online space and economies of scale pushing out smaller participants (source: a leading international consultancy firm). As a leading player in the dedicated online off-price market in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we are in a strong position to take advantage of the consolidation trend within the European market. Our scale, our highly professionalized operations and our value proposition to clear overstock in a discrete manner underline our advantageous position towards brands.

This information has neither been audited, verified or subject to any procedures by any external auditors nor has it been approved by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on such unaudited preliminary financial results, and no opinion or any other form of assurance is provided with respect thereto. Our preliminary unaudited financial results are based upon a number of assumptions and judgments that are subject to inherent uncertainties and are subject to review, change and adjustment in the course of preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the periods presented. Although we believe the management estimates and unaudited preliminary financial information and the assumptions on which they are based to be reasonable, our preliminary financial results are subject to change, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the six months ended June 30, 2022. In addition, we have included certain forward looking statements with respect to our expectations for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2022, which are subject to the same limitations outlined above. The assumptions related to our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA performance for the year ending December 31, 2022 (our “guidance”) include our expectation that overstock availability will increase, that the seasonality patterns we have observed historically will be reflected in our sales during the year ending December 31, 2022, that viral growth engine and our paid customer acquisition activities will be effective and that the measures we have taken to align our cost profile with our growth profile will be effective. Furthermore, if our assumptions upon which we have based our guidance prove to be inaccurate, this may result in lower than expected revenue and Adjusted EBITDA during the year ending December 31, 2022 or a less favorable position of the Group in the market, which may in turn have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation._ We recorded preliminary revenue growth of approximately 20% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to €397.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was achieved despite a high comparison base, a challenging market environment characterized by reduced overstock availability and lower consumer sentiment due to inflationary pressures. Compared to the pre-COVID period in the six months ended June 30, 2019 in which we recorded revenues of €244.4 million, we expect to have achieved a revenue CAGR of approximately 25% in the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the six months ended June 30, 2022 is anticipated to have followed the same seasonality as the pre-COVID years of 2019 and earlier, when the Adjusted EBITDA margin in the six month period was around two to three percentage points below that of the full year. This seasonality is typical for any regular business year due to the volume and margin difference between the spring/summer and autumn/winter seasons. The anticipated margin also reflects the increase of our paid customer acquisition activities during the six months ended June 30, 2022, which represents one of the key pillars of our strategy to drive growth in underpenetrated regions and markets. Our cash and cash equivalents stood at €82.5 million as of June 30, 2022 (March 31, 2022: €68.1 million; June 30, 2021: €69.2 million restated). The Existing Revolving Credit Facility, which has a total size of €110 million, was undrawn as of June 30, 2022. The leverage ratio, which is calculated as net financial debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA, is expected to be at a similar level as the 2.4x as at March 31, 2022 (June 30, 2021: 2.2x). For the year ending December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, management expects an increase in revenue in the low 20s percent range and an Adjusted EBITDA growth by at least a high single 9 ----- digit rate. Based on management estimates, 2022 is thus expected to be another year in which we will further expand our leading position for online off-price fashion in Europe.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,560,PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,560.6,Our History,560.6.1,,"BestSecret draws on a heritage of nearly 100 years in the textile industry. In 1924, Herman Schustermann founded a textile company in Makredwitz, Germany and relocated to Munich in the late 1940s. In the early 1950s, Benno Borenstein established his textile business in Munich. The two companies merged in 1960, and, after the death of Herman Schustermann, a new cooperation was established with Herman’s son, Emil Schustermann, and Benno Borenstein as partners. While Schustermann & Borenstein initially started out as a combination of two textile trading companies with regional customer bases around Munich, ready-to-wear clothes were added to the portfolio over the next decades and the closed membership retail business model was born. Prior to 2007, our business operations were limited to our Schustermann & Borenstein offline retail stores in Munich. In 2007, we launched our BestSecret online platform. In 2011, we made the BestSecret online platform available in the Austrian market, setting the first milestone for our international expansion strategy. Since then, we have continued our online expansion with the launch of our online presence in Sweden (2015), Switzerland (2015), France (2016), The Netherlands (2018) and, most recently, Belgium (2021) and Poland (2022). Today, our multi-language online platform is available across Europe with shipping available to 27 countries. We have continued to maintain a limited physical presence with premium and outlet stores in strategic locations, with such locations designed primarily to support our online platform. In 2012, the BestSecret Group’s founding families sold a majority stake of 61% of the business to Ardian. In 2014, construction commenced on the new centralized fulfillment center in Poing, Germany (near Munich), which became operational in early 2016 and consolidated our then-existing seven warehouses. In 2014, we expanded our offline retail footprint through the opening of a new store in Vienna, Austria. In 2016, we acquired Swiss Online Shopping AG, a leading off-price player in Switzerland, to further expand our online presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (hereafter referred to as the DACH region). In January 2017, funds owned and managed by Permira acquired a majority stake in the Group. In 2019 and 2020, we expanded our fulfillment center in Poing, Germany by approximately 60% to support our business growth. In late 2020, Dr. Moritz Hahn joined us after nine years of experience at Zalando SE where he served as a member of the Executive Committee and held numerous senior positions. He has since built a strong leadership team of ecommerce pioneers with decades of relevant experience across the tech and e-commerce industry, complemented by senior individuals with long-term experience at and in-depth knowledge of the Company. In early 2021, this senior leadership team announced the new vision “to become the number one online destination for off-price fashion in Europe.” The accompanying strategy is focused on online pure-play, profitable growth across Europe. The offline strategy was sharpened to focus on supporting our online value proposition with premium stores designed to elevate our brand image and outlet stores to clear inventory that fails to sell online. In 2021, the structure and brand profile across the Group was simplified and harmonized, merging and renaming the companies to solely feature the BestSecret name across the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

If we are unable to maintain our existing relationships or build new relationships with brands on favorable commercial terms, we may be unable to offer an appropriate selection or quantity of merchandise at discounted prices, which would reduce the appeal of our offering. Only a few of the brand partners we work with have a continuing obligation to provide us with merchandise at historical levels or at all. Furthermore, building new relationships with prospective brand partners can be a lengthy and time-consuming process leading to prolonged lead times until merchandise becomes available for our members to purchase, which in turn could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction. Our business depends on successful merchandise financial planning and open-to-buy management (a management system that aligns budgets to planned inventory). If these prove inadequate, we could fail to secure and offer an attractive inventory to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We must also be able to present our offering to our customers by providing our customers with a unique and personalized online fashion experience using machine learning algorithms and big data. If we are unable to present our offering on our apps, websites and in our stores in an inspiring and attractive way or if we are unable to adapt to the fast-changing developments of social media platforms, we may be unable to attract new customers, may lose existing customers or may be faced with reduced volumes of purchases on our apps and websites, which could limit our growth and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. To deliver a desirable online fashion experience to our customers, we rely on third parties and our brand partners to create content (including photography, other media, and text) which we use on our online platform, in marketing campaigns, advertisements and our online presence generally. Any failure by such third parties or brand partners to produce content that effectively promotes our products could have an adverse effect on our business. Our business also depends on sufficient availability of overstock in the market, which could be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions, changes to the distribution plans of our brand partners or an overall decline in the fashion market. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has and will potentially continue to have a wide range of supply chain implications, including increases in cost and disruption in freight transport. Similarly, the lockdowns and the temporary port closures in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic have and will potentially continue to lead to lower availability of stock because of reduced merchandise production or transportation delays. See also “––Negative developments in global and local economic conditions in our markets _could adversely impact consumer spending in the fashion market.” Additionally, our brand partners may not be_ willing or able to fulfill our product requests or fulfill our product request in full due to lack of stock, a change in their supply-chain model or aggressive competition from other industry participants, including other off-price retailers, on and offline, bidding against us for the same merchandise. Furthermore, brand partners may start managing their product relationships with sellers on a global, rather than local level, which could adversely affect us. As a result of our exclusive, invitation-only membership model, we must balance exclusivity and the protection 26 ----- of brand equity with our growth ambitions. If we fail to strike an appropriate balance, we could fail to achieve our desired growth or negatively affect the brand equity of our brand partners, who may decide to prevent us from offering merchandise for sale through a particular sales channel. Our ability to build a relevant offering for our customers through a broad assortment of desirable products in the right categories and quantities could be affected if we are prevented from offering merchandise through a particular sales channel. If we are unable to secure an appropriate selection and quantity of merchandise on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may be unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers and consequently increase or maintain sales, which could also diminish the attractiveness of our proposition for brand partners, limiting access to merchandise, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,We face strong competition in our markets and such competition may intensify further.,"We are a leading European members-only destination for online off-price fashion, operating in the market for mid-market to luxury fashion. We provide our customers with exclusive access to a portfolio of approximately 3,000 brands, while offering our brand partners a structural solution to sell their overstock through a discreet and controlled channel. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are online off-price and full-price retailers and platforms, including those devoted solely to fashion as well as other types of online platforms and including single-brand as well as multi-brand retailers and marketplaces. In addition, we are to some extent also competing with offline off-price and full-price retailers, such as traditional retail stores, brand outlet stores and off-price fashion stores, due to the operation of our outlet locations and due to partially overlapping customer demographics and supply markets. New competitors who enter our markets or existing offline competitors that shift to online platforms may be successful in attracting customers, including our customers, and thereby capturing market share from us, particularly in Germany, our core market. Some of our current and potential future competitors may have greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do. Such competitors may be able to out-bid us for merchandise we would like to access, acquire more attractive merchandise in greater quantities, deliver merchandise more rapidly, or devote more resources to technology, order fulfillment and marketing than we can. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison-shopping and renders e-commerce inherently more competitive than other retail platforms. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search services, may favor our competition. Also, alternative business models may emerge that would compete with us or diminish the attractiveness or utility of our business model. In particular, social commerce, that is, the use of social networks in the context of e-commerce transactions, as well as the growing popularity of online secondhand fashion retail, could potentially disrupt our business model. If we are unable to compete effectively and fail to attract our target customers to purchase our merchandise, we could lose market share to our competitors. In addition, our brand partners allocate merchandise among ourselves and our competitors depending on the timeliness of orders. If we are unable to act quickly when our brand partners make their merchandise available for purchase, or if we otherwise fail to procure merchandise from our brand partners, for example, due to lack of availability in the market or if the brand partner decides to sell it to another competitor in the market, we could lose market share to our competitors. Furthermore, our plans to expand our business operations into new markets and markets in which we currently have a relatively small presence may be adversely affected by strong competition. For example, some of our competitors may already have long established customer or brand relationships and operations in these markets, which may put them at a competitive advantage. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully. Should competitive pressure intensify, the resources available to adjust our operations effectively and in a timely manner could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Acquisitions or other consolidating transactions could harm us in a number of ways, including losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing our company to expend greater resources to meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm our operating results.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,Negative developments in global and local economic conditions in our markets could adversely impact consumer spending in the fashion market.,"We primarily sell fashion products online. Purchases of our customers are discretionary, and therefore dependent upon the level of customer spending, particularly among affluent customers. As a result, our performance depends on global and regional economic conditions, which have shown significant volatility in recent years. For example, economic contraction, economic uncertainty, and the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions, whether as a result of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”), the conflict in Ukraine or otherwise, has and could continue to cause a decline in the demand for the merchandise we sell. In addition, the continued prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine and their related effects has and could continue to lead to a disruption of our supply chain or a decline in the supply of products produced by our brand partners, which could in turn lead to supply shortages and inflationary pressure. The COVID-19 pandemic has in the past led, and in the future could lead, to closure of our retail stores on a temporary or permanent basis. If we are forced to close any of our retail stores, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reason, there is no guarantee that we would be able to terminate the relevant lease, secure a sublease or implement any other cost-defraying arrangement for the remainder of the lease term. Furthermore, changes in discretionary consumer spending may be influenced, among other things, by factors such as inflation, higher unemployment levels, rising interest rates, reduced access to credit, recessionary economic cycles, increases in taxes or perceived or actual declines in disposable consumer income and wealth. Our online platform is available in multiple languages and offers shipping to 27 European countries, with the majority of our revenue currently generated in our core market Germany and the DACH region. A negative development, contraction or lack of growth in the economies of the DACH region or the other European countries where we operate or may operate in the future, and in overall macroeconomic conditions, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be more affected by such economic weakness or uncertainty than some of our competitors with more diversified international operations. There is also a risk of increased taxes, for the purpose of addressing the extraordinary levels of public spending and public debt related to the COVID-19 pandemic, in some or all of the European countries in which we sell our merchandise. Tax increases that lead to increases in the sales prices of our products or the prices of services we purchase or offer or reduce the income available for consumption could also weaken demand for our fashion products. Germany, our home market, which had seen a long period of stable economic growth since the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008, reported a 5.0% decline in its gross domestic product for 2020 compared to 2019 according to Destatis. Although Germany’s gross domestic product reported a 2.7% increase for 2021 compared to 2020, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related countermeasures and the Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely continue to dampen economic prospects in Europe in the short term. While Germany still generates most of our revenue (72% in the year ended December 31, 2021), the international sales share has increased substantially in recent years and international growth is one of our current strategic focus areas. Although the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to growth in the online fashion industry both in 2020 and 2021, an end to government support programs, increased interest rates and the lifting of quantitative easing measures, could trigger a continued economic downturn in one or more of our markets which may result in higher levels of unemployment and as a consequence materially negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending, including purchases of fashion and lifestyle products. Geopolitical tensions, including but not limited to tensions between Russia and its neighboring countries, including Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states, tensions between China and the United States or acts of terrorism, could also negatively affect the demand for and supply of our merchandise. In late February 2022, Russian military forces launched a significant military action against Ukraine, which continues to date, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely. The instability of the general security situation, as well as any actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions by the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Such instability could lead to delays in completing our planned fulfillment center in Poland, as well as disruptions to the fulfillment center’s operations if such instability continues after the fulfillment center is operational. We may also be affected due to the negative impact of such geopolitical tensions on consumer confidence and consumer shopping behavior, resulting in lower sales and results of operation. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the pace and extent of the global economic recovery remains highly uncertain, and certain markets may not in the future achieve the growth rates that they have historically observed. 28 ----- The aggravation of the foregoing factors including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and/or, more generally, an extended recession or other periods of declining economic conditions, either globally or in any of the markets in which we operate, could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. If our markets do not develop as anticipated or are negatively affected by global and local economic conditions, as well as geopolitical tensions, consumer spending in the fashion market may be adversely affected and demand for our products may not increase as currently anticipated. Consequently, we may not be able to recoup the investments made in these markets and may be forced to close, or decide to divest, our operations in selected markets, which could have an adverse material effect on the implementation of our expansion strategy and consequently on our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.5,Our industry and the sale of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuations and unfavorable weather.,"The industry in which we operate is seasonal in nature, and our revenue, profits, liquidity and inventory levels are therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, we typically experience an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of the year due to special sales events (e.g., Cyber Week) and the Christmas shopping season. In the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue in the fourth quarter accounted for 34.2% of our total revenue for the year. These seasonal influences have a direct impact on our results of operations and overall profitability. Any factors that deter customers from purchasing online or visiting our stores during these periods could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. In addition, atypical weather conditions could impact our sales and operating results. When the weather is warmer than expected in the autumn and winter months, our customers tend to purchase fewer winter collection items. Similarly, when the weather is cooler than expected in the summer months, our customers tend to purchase fewer summer collection items. During times of such unfavorable weather, we may be required to lower our prices, negatively impacting our margins and our profit. If we cannot offset the lower-sales seasons with those having stronger sales, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Seasonal fluctuations also impact our working capital, liquidity levels and inventory. We incur additional expenses in the preparation for the increased demand we typically expect leading up to, and around, the special sales events (e.g., Cyber Week sale) and Christmas season and other peak selling periods and must carry a significant amount of inventory before such periods, which is also reflected in our liquidity. If too many customers access our website within a short period of time due to increased demand or unexpectedly strong peaks, our businesses may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment networks and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other third-party shipping (or carrier) companies may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. In addition, seasonal products, such as winter clothing, being delayed may only be sold in the next season and may increase storage costs. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including but not limited to unfavorable weather, age and quantity of inventory at period end and the timing, extent and impact of government-imposed restrictions related to COVID-19. As a result, historical period-toperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future period-to-period results. The results of a single fiscal quarter may not be an indication of our annual results or our future performance. Increasing weather anomalies could complicate forecasting seasonal demand. Natural disasters, such as storms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes or other major weather disasters may also have a negative impact on our business. Our inability to compensate for seasonal fluctuations and adapt to weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

While we take extensive steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of sensitive and confidential information (e.g., password policies and firewalls), our security practices or those of our third-party service providers may be insufficient and third parties may breach our systems (e.g., through Trojans, spyware, ransomware or other malware attacks, or breaches by our employees or third-party service providers). Such attacks or breaches which may result in shutdowns of our sites, loss or corruption of data or unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Such attacks might lead to blackmailing attempts, forcing us to pay substantial amounts to release our captured data or resulting in the unauthorized release of such data, or to identity theft or unauthorized purchases, requiring us to pay compensation to the victims. Cyberattacks could also target our logistics, supply or office systems, which could result in order fulfillment delays, leading to cancelled orders and a subsequent decline in revenue, as well as reputational damages. We have been subject to attempted cyber, phishing or social engineering attacks in the past and may continue to be subject to such attacks in the future. As we gain greater visibility, we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyberattacks. We may also need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, which may require us to divert resources from the growth and expansion of our business. We and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all such cyberattacks. Moreover, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers, and consequently it may be impossible to properly secure our systems. In addition, technical advances or a continued expansion and increased complexity of our IT infrastructure, as well as non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our employees, our third-party service providers, or their personnel, could increase the likelihood of security breaches. As we have significantly increased the number of employees working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as our businesses’ vendors and other business partners continue to work remotely as well, our business and our partners may be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The techniques used to gain such access to our business or our business partners’ information technology systems, our data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Increasingly, unauthorized parties are exploiting access they gain to third party vendors to target companies that do business with these vendors, and this may include third party vendors with whom we do business. 30 ----- Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments have increased and could further increase the frequency or likelihood of security breaches. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships, including third-party developers, consultants, outsourced customer support or operational personnel of hosting providers (e.g., Microsoft, Noris AG) with direct access to databases and customer-related services.

For example, our offering is founded on our vertically integrated, proprietary technology platform specifically designed for the sourcing, presentation, curation, marketing, and fulfillment of fashion products. In addition, as an e-commerce platform, we generate a high volume of traffic on, and use of, our apps and websites to analyze a broad range of customer data, tracking individual journeys and ensuring efficient spending of our marketing resources. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our apps and websites and their underlying network infrastructure. As our customer base and the amount of information shared on our apps and websites continue to grow, we will require additional network capacity and computing power. In addition, we need to maintain reliable internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as ensuring timely development of complementary products. Furthermore, we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties in part to maintain and develop our computer hardware and software. The operation of our technology systems is expensive and complex and could result in operational failures.

In addition, our customers may lack confidence in the security of our online platform and may consequently be unwilling to share personal information with us through the online platform. In the event that our customer base or the amount of traffic on our websites grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to enhance the underlying network infrastructure. Inadequate performance of our technology systems, whether due to telecommunication problems, software errors, inadequate capacity at IT centers, fire, power outages or damage, attacks by third parties, computer viruses and the delayed or failed implementation of new computer systems or other unexpected events or causes, could affect the security or availability of our apps and websites, prevent customers from accessing our apps and websites and result in limited capacity, reduced demand, processing delays and loss of customers. Our existing safety systems, data backup, access protection, user management and IT emergency planning may not be sufficient to prevent information loss or disruptions to our IT infrastructure. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security and availability of our products and technology systems to the satisfaction of our customers and certain regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we need to continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of user-enhanced services, features and functionalities, while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. If we fail to make necessary upgrades, our technology systems and data platform could be insufficient to allow us to make datadriven decisions, in both the context of our day-to-day operations and our larger business initiatives as our business grows and expands in scope. We are currently, among other projects, working on a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. There is the potential risk that the project’s goals are not achieved, delayed, or not fully achieved, the system is inoperable after its completion, or that there are difficulties in implementing the system that could impact the operating business. In addition, other business projects may have to be postponed, which would result in the failure to achieve the planned level of efficiency. There is also the risk that, even after a successful launch, the ERP system fails to interface successfully or work in conjunction with our existing systems. As a result, dependent projects may not be realized within expected timeframes. Any of the foregoing is likely to create additional costs for manual adjustments and negatively impact our topline growth goals. In addition, our 31 ----- growing IT needs have led to increasing levels of utilization of our existing IT branch offices in Spain. In addition, any upgrade, development or maintenance of our systems and infrastructure could lead us to incur unexpected costs. We use cloud services to store and maintain customer data as well as to support our IT infrastructure. An interruption or breakdown of our technology systems and IT infrastructure due to power outages, fire, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, actions of third-party providers or any other unanticipated reason cannot be ruled out completely. The disaster recovery arrangements we have put in place, have not been tested during actual disasters or similar events and may not effectively permit us to continue to run our business in the event of any problems with respect to the data that we use. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurances that these types of events will not occur in the future. If our cloud service partners fail, we may experience downtime on our apps and websites which could reduce the attractiveness of our apps and websites to customers. Failure in our IT infrastructure could also result in unfavorable media coverage, damage our reputation, and/or result in regulatory inquiries or other proceedings. Any failure to operate and maintain our technology systems, integrate, and scale our network and mobile infrastructure could result in customer dissatisfaction, and thus harm our reputation, lead to a loss of revenue or subject us to claims for damages, which could jeopardize the implementation of our further growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

To optimize the mobile shopping experience, we are dependent on our customers downloading our specific mobile app for their particular device(s) or accessing our website from an internet browser. With the continued release of new mobile devices and operating systems, we face difficulties predicting the problems we may encounter in developing apps for these alternative devices and operating systems, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such applications. In addition, our future growth and our results of operations could suffer if we experience difficulties in the future in integrating our apps into mobile devices, if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile app stores, such as those of the Apple App Store or Google Play, if our apps receive unfavorable treatment compared to competing applications, such as the order of our apps within application stores, or if we face increased costs to distribute or have customers use our mobile applications. We are further dependent on the interoperability of our sites with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as iOS and Android, and any changes in such systems that degrade the functionality of our sites or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect the usage of our sites on mobile devices. Further, we continually upgrade existing technologies and business applications, and we may be required to implement new technologies or business applications in the future. The implementation of upgrades and changes requires significant investments. The timing, effectiveness and costs associated with the successful implementation of any upgrades or changes to our systems and infrastructure could have adverse effects on our results of operations. In the event that it is more difficult for our customers to access and use our sites on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose not to access or to use our sites on their mobile devices or to use mobile products that do not offer access to our sites, our customer growth could be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We must be able to incorporate new technologies into our services in order to address the needs of our customers. Our e-commerce platform may become unstable or unavailable due to failure to perform necessary upgrades, exposure to cyber-attacks or any other failure of our computer systems and related information technology infrastructure. The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such 32 ----- as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower up-front technology costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete with advancing technology or be able to maintain existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost-effective manner, and any failure to do so could result in customers seeking alternative products or service providers, thereby adversely impacting our revenue and operating income. The functioning of our online business depends to a large extent on our customers receiving the ordered goods in a timely and smooth manner and being able to return them without any difficulties. If the traffic volume on our websites or the number of purchases made by customers substantially increases, our current transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, storage facilities and delivery systems may be unable to accommodate the increased volume. This includes our own systems, services and infrastructure as well as those owned and/or managed by third parties. Additionally, we may be unable to accurately forecast these increases or to upgrade our supply chain systems in time to accommodate them. If our delivery infrastructure comes under strain from an unexpected or higher-than-expected spike in customer orders, or for any other reason, we may be unable to honor orders on our usual delivery terms, which could lead to negative reputational consequences for ourselves and our brand partners. Furthermore, our transaction processing systems may result in our online platform displaying expected delivery times to our customers that do not reflect actual order backlogs or delivery times. Inconsistencies between expected and actual delivery times could lead to customer dissatisfaction with our online platform. We are constantly monitoring our fulfillment and logistics capacity to keep up with those requirements and match our continued growth. However, we cannot rule out that our significant and continued growth results in our warehouse capacities being brought to their limits faster than anticipated. Due to the increasing levels of utilization of our existing fulfillment and returns centers, we are currently planning a new fulfillment center in Sulechów, Poland to provide us with additional flexibility and to address further future growth. The new fulfillment center is scheduled to enter preliminary stages of operation in 2023 and is expected to be larger than our current main fulfillment center in Poing, Germany. We may make incorrect assumptions regarding the necessary size, the technical design and the level of automation required of the new facility. Any unexpected cost overruns, poor planning, delays or other unforeseen factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, after the new logistics center is completed, our increasingly complex order fulfillment operation could have an adverse effect on our ability to supply our customers, including as a result of split orders and orders that require movement between warehouses. Furthermore, an increase in political tensions between Poland and other European nations (and in particular, other members of the European Union) culminating in a withdrawal from the European Union by Poland could have a negative impact on our order fulfillment operations. As of March 31, 2022, our total capital expenditure for this project amounted to €0.2 million. We currently anticipate that the new fulfillment center in Poland will require additional capital expenditure across the years ending December 31, 2022 through December 31, 2024. There can be no guarantee, however, that volatile raw material prices and inflation will not cause our projected capital expenditure to be inaccurate or that we will be able to raise additional financing on favorable terms or at all. Also, as we continue to grow and expand internationally, it is not certain that we will be able to find suitable fulfillment center sites on commercially acceptable terms to support any future expansion plans. We might also need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated in order to increase the capacity of our logistics infrastructure.

Such future revenue and results of operations are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. Seasonal variations in our inventories, working capital requirements and cash flows, among other things, also increase the difficulty of our financial forecasting and could adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results. For any given season, a substantial portion of our expenses is incurred in advance, and therefore fixed, due to the seasonality of demand for our products and the necessity of purchasing merchandise with significant lead times. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 33 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Consumer preferences regarding fashion design, quality, sustainability, and price tend to change rapidly. Hence, accurately forecasting the selection and required quantities of such products in future periods is difficult. Accelerated through short-term trends and sentiments on social media, the popularity of products can change significantly between the time products are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, the lead times we must incur in taking delivery of merchandise from many of our brand partners could pose challenges by increasing, in some cases significantly, the time it takes us to respond to changes in product trends, consumer demand and market prices. Our success depends in large part on our ability to gauge, react and adapt to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. To be responsive to shifting customer tastes, we must manage our inventory levels closely, including through identifying market trends and seasonality. If we misjudge, fail to identify, or fail to react swiftly to changes in consumer preferences and market trends, our sales could decrease, and we could see a significant increase in our inventory levels. If we are left with high levels of unsold or returned stock, or if our inventory provisions are inadequate, our storage capacity could be negatively impacted and we could be required to mark down some of our merchandise, which could lower our operating profits and have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer interest in our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages, unfulfilled orders, increased distribution expenses and lower revenue and profitability than we could otherwise have achieved. Inventory shortages could lead to customer dissatisfaction and adversely impact our reputation and brand image. The success of our buying teams is largely based on leveraging their decision-making, experience, and their relationships with brand partners to outpace the competition. Insufficient controls within the purchasing process may lead to unapproved or incorrect orders and may result in financial disadvantages for the Group due to non-sellable inventory or liquidity risks. In the fashion industry, customer demand can quickly change depending on many factors, including promotional activities of competitors, rapidly changing tastes and preferences, frequent introductions of new products and services, advances in technology and the internet and macroeconomic factors, many of which are beyond our control, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the latest geopolitical developments and their impact on economic conditions. With this constantly changing environment, our future business strategies, practices, and results may not meet expectations or respond quickly enough to customer demand, and we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to any changes, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Capacity constraints, interruptions or other failures in our supply chain could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.","The profitability of our business depends on our ability to successfully process and deliver our customers’ orders. Our ability to process and fill orders accurately and timely depends on the efficient, uninterrupted operation of our main fulfillment center in Poing, Germany, where we store nearly all of our inventory, and our warehouse management IT system. Our main fulfillment center is, therefore, critical to our business. If operations at our fulfillment or returns centers were interrupted due to factors including, but not limited to, natural disasters (such as flooding or fire), labor disruptions (such as labor strikes, shortages of temporary workers or ethical disputes), technical defects, accidents, the COVID-19 pandemic, inappropriate storage of hazardous goods or any other reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, due to the high level of integration between our fulfillment center and points of sale, any interruption of logistics at our fulfillment center would also have a significant adverse effect on our ability to supply our customers and could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation. A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, could disrupt the operation of our supply chain and jeopardize our ability to receive, process and deliver our customers’ orders. System interruptions in any of our own or externally operated technology platforms and services could delay or prevent our receipt of customer orders, shipments or returns. 34 ----- Our ability to deliver orders to our customers, including pre-orders, within a time frame that meets customer expectations also depends on efficient internal processes as well as on third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced certain processes, such as the handling of bulky goods or returns, and on third-party delivery companies in each of the countries in which we operate. Any disruptions to these processes could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also rely on third-party service providers for the handling of certain processes and on a limited number of third-party carriers, including DHL and Hermes, for the delivery of merchandise to our fulfillment and return centers as well as for delivery to online customers. We are therefore exposed to any failures or shortcomings by these service providers or carriers, including delivery delays or damage, loss, or theft of goods. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these entities, if they significantly increase their charges or they experience performance problems, including as a result of inflationary pressures and the COVID-19 pandemic, it could negatively impact our customer experience. Any breakdown or disruption of the activities of these service providers or carriers resulting from, among other things, inclement weather, natural disasters, transportation interruptions, labor shortages, oil price increases, epidemics or unrest could impair our ability to supply our fulfillment center at current cost levels or at all, make timely deliveries to customers or maintain an appropriate logistics chain and level of inventory, all of which could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. The merger, acquisition, insolvency or government regulation or shutdown of any third-party contractors we use in our supply chain could also interrupt order processing, storage, and delivery. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain relationships with our current carriers, and we may at any point be required to contract with other carriers at a potentially greater cost. Finally, we may face price increases by the third-party carriers we use which may result in higher fulfillment expenses we may only partially be able to pass on to our customers. Furthermore, we have incurred costs relating to our COVID-19 measures throughout our European offices, our stores and our main fulfillment center in Poing, Germany. Such costs include bonus and hazard pay, increased health and safety measures such as the temporary introduction of a third shift in our logistics center, the implementation of regular tests and extensive hygienic measures, as well as costs relating to the closure of our outlet in Frankfurt, Germany. Furthermore, the effects of the COVID-19 virus could in the future disrupt our supply chain and distribution and fulfillment capabilities, including shipments of our merchandise to impacted regions or from our main fulfillment center. There is continuing uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, store closures, as well as its further impact on the global economy and consumer confidence. New variants of COVID-19 continue to emerge, including the Delta variant and more recently, the Omicron variant, which have caused and may continue to cause significant uncertainty. The future impact of other variants that may emerge cannot be predicted at this time and could include temporary or permanent store closures. Such impacts may be affected by numerous factors, including vaccination rates and availability, the effectiveness of current vaccines against the variants and responses by various governments, such as lockdowns and other restrictive measures. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship merchandise to customers may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and related response measures, inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, trade embargoes and similar factors. For example, strikes at major international shipping ports may in the future impact our supply of inventory from our brand partners, and the escalating trade disputes between the United States, the European Union, China, and certain other regions could lead to increased tariffs on our goods. If the manufacturing, delivery, or supply chain management processes relating to our merchandise are disrupted as a result of these factors or for any reason, we may be delayed in restoring our inventory of the affected products and we may experience a significant increase in our cost of sales. Any failure to adequately manage and improve our supply chain could reduce our transaction volume, increase cancelled orders, undermine customer satisfaction, damage our business reputation, limit our competitiveness, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Our online platform is available in multiple languages and offers shipping to 27 European countries, with the majority of our revenue currently generated in our core market Germany and the DACH region. As part of our strategy, we are expanding internationally, which could lead to higher shipping and logistics costs that could negatively impact our margins and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, our operations, including our supply chain, could be affected by the withdrawal of additional countries from the EU. For example, we have operations in Poland, where we also expect an additional fulfillment center to enter preliminary stages of operation in 2023. A withdrawal of Poland from the EU would create significant 35 ----- political and economic uncertainty regarding the future relationship between Poland and the EU and could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our operations in Poland and the EU. If, in such a case, Poland and the EU are unable to negotiate an agreement governing their future relationship that allows free trade of goods across the borders between Poland and EU member states, there could be significant delivery delays and cost increases for our supply chain. Our operations, including our supply chain, has and could continue to be similarly affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Sustained conflict and disruption in the region has and, combined with the instability of the general security situation, could continue to lead to interruptions in our supply chain.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

In an environment characterized by increasing levels of promotions and customer discounts, the growth of our customer base and sales depends on the success of our general marketing activities, our incentive programs for customer referrals from existing customers and our paid customer acquisition activities. We rely on social media to support the positioning of our offering, extending invites to acquire new customers, increase the number of customer visits to our websites, the number of orders and the basket size per order. In particular, we depend heavily on Meta platforms (e.g., Facebook and Instagram), as our most-used paid customer acquisition marketing channel. Changes to the terms and conditions of the relevant providers could limit our ability to communicate through social media. These services may also change their algorithms or interfaces, including without notification, which may reduce our visibility or increase our costs. Our growth and profitability are dependent on our viral customer growth model, with existing customers inviting their friends and families to join our community. In order to build on this structural customer growth, we have recently increased our investments related to brand awareness and customer acquisition in underpenetrated regions and countries, and we expect to continue to invest in attracting new customers. Paid social marketing (performance marketing and social media marketing), which is geared to a critical, selected target group and closely aligned with our brand partners, is our principal instrument to enter new opportunities in existing markets and new markets. Our investments in viral marketing, paid customer acquisition and customer loyalty may prove ineffective. In addition, with the constantly increasing popularity of social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, TikTok, Twitch), influencer marketing has become an increasingly applied marketing tool especially in the fashion industry. We also integrate independent influencers into our branding and content strategy by using their endorsements and mentions on their social media channels to enhance our brand awareness. These collaborations with influencers may not achieve the anticipated success, or subject us to reputational damage (for example through misbehavior on the part of an influencer cooperating with us). Critiques on blogs, forums and social media, based on ecological, ethical or many other considerations, and regardless of whether such critique is reasonable or not, may cause damage to our reputation and our product offering and may result in us being required to withdraw certain merchandise. We also use e-mail newsletters, app push notifications and other messaging services in order to promote our platform, inform customers of our product offering and/or the status of their transactions. Changes in how webmail services organize and prioritize e-mails could reduce the number of customers opening our e-mails. For example, several service providers organize incoming e-mails into categories. Such tools and features could result in our e-mails and other messages being shown as “spam”, “junk” or otherwise as lower-priority messages to our customers, which could reduce the likelihood of customers opening or responding positively to them. Certain customers may experience dissatisfaction and cease to use our platform if they perceive themselves to be oversaturated with advertising campaigns or newsletters or otherwise exposed to social media, e-mail or text message “flooding.” Our customers may also lack interest in the content of our e-mail messages, or such messages may fail to be delivered or may be delayed in their delivery for technical reasons. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on, or charge for the delivery of, e-mails, app push notifications and other messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing additional requirements on our ability to conduct e-mail marketing, could impair our ability to communicate with our customers. In addition, any malfunction of our communication services could result in erroneous messages being sent and customers no longer wanting to receive any messages from us. Furthermore, our process to obtain consent from users of our apps and visitors to our websites to receive newsletters, app push notifications and other messages from us and to allow us to use their data may be seen as insufficient or invalid. As a result, such individuals or third parties may accuse us of sending unsolicited advertisements and other messages which could result in claims against us. 36 ----- There can be no assurance that our assumptions regarding marketing strategies, required customer acquisition investment and resulting revenue from such customers, including those relating to the effectiveness of our marketing expenditures, will prove to be correct or lead to increased sales. Also, while we attach the highest importance to our brand partner relationships and therefore to brand protection, our paid customer acquisition activities may not be met with approval by all brand partners and lead to an adverse effect on our relationships. Failure to implement our marketing strategies, or their failure to result in increased sales, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position, and results of operations and on the implementation of our growth strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology. The ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. Our current and potential future competitors may be able to secure more favorable pricing terms from brand partners, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, or otherwise offer similar merchandise at more attractive prices. If we offer products at higher prices than our competitors, our customers may choose to shop with our competitors, which could result in a loss of customers and revenue. We are therefore dependent on the performance of our sourcing and pricing processes, including on our pricing tool, to provide the right pricing recommendations. We currently price our inventory through a combination of manual initial pricing, followed by automatic adjustment through the use of an algorithm, which could limit our ability to price our products at an optimal level. Poor pricing decisions could lead to offering items at prices that are too low or pricing items uncompetitively high. Furthermore, retailers and brands set their own retail prices for consumers, which can include promotional and sales period discounts. Such discounts by these parties may adversely affect the relative value of overstock offered for sale with us. In order to attract buyers to our online platform, the prices for the overstock merchandise we sell may need to be lowered in order to compete with discounted pricing employed by retailers and brands for the items sold directly by them. Our prices also depend in part on our sourcing and logistics costs which in turn depend on the development of prices for certain raw materials, in particular cotton and other textile raw materials, as well as fuel. We are typically impacted by increases in the prices of raw materials and fuel price as well as carrier-charge increases, as our brand partners and third-party service providers attempt to pass along these increases to us. Although we may attempt to pass on cost increases to our customers by increasing selling prices via regular price reviews and adjustments, we may not always be able to do so, for example, if our brand partners attempt to exercise control over our pricing. Moreover, any price increases could adversely affect our sales or our decision to increase discount rates to remain competitive in the market could reduce our profitability. During periods of declining input or fuel prices, customer demand may also require that we sell our products at lower prices or may restrict our ability to increase prices, in spite of the fact that we may use goods that were purchased at higher prices or that we are forced to incur higher shipping costs, thereby negatively impacting our margins.

We only enter into long-term agreements with brand partners in exceptional cases. Accordingly, we source most of our merchandise based on individual purchase orders with our brand partners. This informal way of working may result in a less precise definition of the parties’ respective rights and may, in the event of a disagreement between them regarding the terms of the purchase and supply of merchandise, result in disputes or conflicts which may adversely impact our ability to continue sourcing a particular brand or from a particular brand partner.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

These brand partners may also manufacture merchandise for our competitors and their brand partners. Our agreements with the manufacturers of our private label merchandise, which set forth the production and delivery of private label merchandise, are typically based on an order-by-order concept for each private label brand rather than long-term supply agreements. In case an agreement with a private label brand partner is terminated, there can be no assurance that we will find other brand partners that will be able to produce comparable replacement merchandise for us at competitive prices or at all. A small share of our buying activities is with relatively small-scale third-party intermediaries. Particularly goods purchased from such intermediaries have an increased risk of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. Certain brands have in the past alleged that we have sold merchandise which infringes upon their intellectual property, and as a result, we found out that in certain minor cases the merchandise sold did infringe third party intellectual property rights. In such cases, the recourse that we have against such intermediaries may not be viable, as they tend to have little economical substance. As we sell branded products at reduced prices, counterfeit merchandise may harm our reputation and lead to loss of trust and customers. Since we only have limited control over manufacturers of our private label merchandise, there is no guarantee that this merchandise will continue to meet our specifications. Furthermore, any breach or perceived breach of relevant laws, regulations, permits, or licenses relating to the private label merchandise sold by us, or failure to achieve or maintain particular ethical business practices and standards, including with respect to environmental, social, and corporate governance (“ESG”) matters, could also lead to adverse publicity, which could materially adversely affect the reputation of our private label brands, or even the Group, damage our customer relationships and lead to a decline in our sales. As we are the “responsible person” for our private label merchandise within the context of the applicable regulations on product safety applicable to our merchandise, any quality defect could lead (on the basis of EU law or similar applicable national laws) to customer claims, administrative or criminal proceedings and penalties. We could also face damage to our own private label brands’ reputation.

We generate a majority of our revenue from sales of merchandise over the internet via our e-commerce platform, BestSecret. Our e-commerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including: - reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software, the need to keep up with rapid technological change and the implementation of new systems and platforms; - the risk that our e-commerce platform may become unstable or unavailable due to necessary upgrades or the failure of our computer systems or the related IT support systems or that customer data may be misappropriated as a result of computer viruses, telecommunication failures, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, or disruption of internet service, whether for technical reasons or for other causes; 38 ----- - customers finding our e-commerce websites difficult to use or online applications are not compatible with certain electronic devices, being less willing to use our websites than we expect, being unwilling to share personal information online or via our mobile applications, or not being confident that they are secure; - the incurrence of unexpected costs in connection with the maintenance and future development of our e-commerce platform; - liability for online content, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns; - lack of ability to honor our usual delivery terms in case of an unexpected or a higher than expected spike in customer orders or for other reasons that may cause negative reputational consequences; - negative online reviews (including social media posts) from dissatisfied customers which may deter other potential customers from using our e-commerce platform and that may also affect our brands’ reputation and sales in our offline stores; - lack of ability to communicate with our customers using e-mail or other means due to failed or delayed delivery of such e-mails for technical reasons, lack of interest by customers or marking as “spam” or “junk”; - dissatisfaction from certain customers using e-mail or other means when exposed to too many advertising campaigns or newsletters and to what they may consider to be e-mail or text message “flooding”; - actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of e-mails or other messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing additional requirements on us in connection with them, could impair our ability to communicate with customers; - liability for online credit card fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems; and - increased competition from other e-commerce providers. Our failure to respond appropriately to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our revenue (in particular, our revenue from our e-commerce operations) as well as damage our reputation and brands, especially since e-commerce is a significant part of our growth strategy.

Over the past few years, we have developed a sophisticated IT system which supports our apps and websites, customer service, supplier connectivity, communications and the monitoring of customer sales and improved management of inventories. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we need to continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of user-enhanced services, features and functionalities, while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. A range of factors beyond our control, such as telecommunication problems, software errors, inadequate capacity at IT centers, fire, power outages or damage, attacks by third parties, computer viruses and the delayed or failed implementation of new computer systems, could interfere with the availability of our IT systems. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to purchases of merchandise, to be lost or delayed which could result in delays in the delivery of products to customers or lost sales or impair our ability to manage our inventories. Our existing safety systems, data backup, access protection, user management and IT emergency planning may not be sufficient to prevent information loss or disruptions to our IT systems. In addition, if changes in technology cause our IT systems to become obsolete, or if our IT systems are inadequate to handle our growth, our reputation among our customers may be damaged. Any failure to properly guard against the interruption or malfunctioning of our IT systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 39 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

To maintain these relationships and ensure a supply of merchandise from our brand partners, we must secure and preserve the commercial value that derives from consumer perception of the merchandise produced by our brand partners, _i.e., their brand equity. Such brand equity is based on a variety of factors, including level of public awareness of a brand, quality perceptions regarding the brand and the perception of exclusivity surrounding the brand. The brand equity of our brand partners could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, for example through lowered customer perceptions of brand value or exclusivity due to their brands being offered through off-price online platforms, including our BestSecret online platform. Negative publicity, including, but not limited to, negative online reviews on social media from dissatisfied customers or media reports related to our offering whether or not accurate, can deter other potential customers from using our e-commerce platform, which could in turn lead to a negative impact on the value of the brand equity of our brand partners through their association with our platform. If our brand partners perceive a negative impact on their brand equity as a result of their partnership with us, they may choose to lower the amount of merchandise they make available to us for purchase or terminate their partnership with us entirely, which could have an adverse material effect on the attractiveness of our offering to our customers and consequently on our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The success of our expansion may also be affected if we fail to correctly estimate customer demand in local markets. This risk may be higher in new markets in which we operate, where our less established position makes it more difficult to assess customer demand and the appeal of our product offering. Our capital and other expenditures may also be higher than expected due to cost overruns, unexpected delay, or other unforeseen factors. Furthermore, the start of the conflict in Ukraine has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our ability to expand in Germany and internationally due to the pressure the conflict has placed and could continue to place on our supply chain and costs. In addition, if we fail to execute our expansion strategy in a discreet manner, our brand partner relationships may deteriorate, and we may lose certain brand partners. If our expansion strategy is not successful or advances at a slower pace than planned, our competitive position and our profitability and growth may be negatively affected. In addition, any failure by us to anticipate or respond to market demand, control our operating costs, or otherwise effectively address any challenges that arise as we attempt to implement our strategy, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.23,We may be unable to manage our growing business activities effectively.,"Our business has grown significantly over the last decade, and we plan to continue to expand our business. Our historical growth may not be indicative of our future performance. As we implement our growth strategy, operating complexity will increase and will require a continuous expansion and improvement of our operating capabilities in addition to further training and management of our employees. Developing and refining the appropriate processes necessitated by our growth and our increasingly complex group structure, such as internal management, accounting and book-keeping processes, organizational compliance and risk monitoring structures, places high demands on us and our management, as well as on our operational and financial infrastructure, with no assurance that profitability will increase accordingly. As our operations grow further, we will need to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to deal with the greater scale and complexity of operations. We will also need to be able to purchase more off-price products that we can offer and are therefore dependent on sufficient overproduction from brand partners who are willing to sell their products to us. Any delay in improving these processes or reaching an appropriate level of staffing may result in business and administrative oversights and errors, which may also lead to higher operating expenses. We cannot assure you we will be able to achieve any of the foregoing. If we are unable to achieve any or all of the foregoing, we could fail to take full or partial advantage of growth opportunities available to us, and as a result, our business would grow at a slower rate than may otherwise be possible. In addition, our growth could make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will need to make in the future. This growth could also impact the operational flexibility of the 40 ----- supply chain organization and impair our ability to react promptly to changing customer demands and new market trends. If we do not make the necessary capital or other expenditures to accommodate our future growth, we may not be successful in our growth strategy. Continued growth may also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers, may impede our efforts to attract, train, motivate and retain employees, or complicate our plans to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls. Specifically, in certain regions, continued growth could result in our business, including fulfillment services sourced from third parties, being unable to accommodate the number of customers or orders, e.g., if our service providers’ fulfillment centers begin to operate at or near capacity. Due to the increasing levels of utilization of our existing fulfillment and returns centers, we are currently planning a new fulfillment center in Sulechów, Poland to provide us with additional flexibility and to address further future growth. Any unexpected delays in the opening of the new fulfillment center, including as a result of delays in or failure to obtain financing to fund our expansion, could harm our ability to scale the business as planned and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our growing business will also lead to an increase in logistical complexity as well as shipping and fulfillment center costs. Increased logistical complexity contains the risk that it will be more challenging to maintain our operations at the current level and that more unforeseen interruptions and issues could arise that in turn lead to higher shipping and fulfillment center costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be unable to accurately anticipate all the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our business, personnel, systems and controls and procedures, and the failure to appropriately address such demands, or the realization of any of the above-mentioned risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.24,"Our compliance management system and internal controls may not be sufficient to adequately protect us from all legal or financial risks, especially with regards to our business in certain countries where corruption and money laundering may be considered widespread.","To protect us against legal risks and other potential harm, we established a group-wide, centralized compliance management system that comprises several specific compliance programs (e.g., anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, fraud prevention and conflict of interest, economic sanctions compliance and antitrust as well as human rights), including a group-wide Code of Conduct which outlines the general rules of behavior for our management and employees as well as our business ethics. Our central compliance function is carried out by our legal department and our managing directors and is complemented by external law firms. Direct reporting lines to the management board and the advisory board are set up. Yet, these codes, guidelines and policies and the oversight of our internal compliance and legal departments might not be sufficient to prevent all unauthorized practices, legal infringements, corruption, and fraud—especially regarding purchasing practices—or other adverse consequences of non-compliance within our organization or by or on behalf of our employees or third parties. Any compliance failure could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To comply with legal requirements as well as to achieve our corporate goals efficiently and effectively, as an integrated part of the Corporate Governance structure, we established a formally documented group-wide risk management system. Having a well-defined and uniform Risk Management System in place allows us to recognize, assess, manage and monitor risks that might potentially threaten our operations now and in the future. Through early detection of risks-related issues and implementation of suitable countermeasures we minimize our risk exposure. Our central risk management is carried out by the risk manager, who represents the link between the risk owners, managing directors and the advisory board, and continuously develops and improves our Risk Management System to ensure its completeness and correctness. However, as we operate in a very dynamic environment, our risk management system and periodical risk assessment might not be sufficient to ensure that all potential events impacting our organization are timely identified and promptly mitigated, also due to risks characteristic that their probability of occurrence and potential impact on organization cannot be determined with certainty. To identify, monitor and control internal risks related to our business processes we established a group-wide internal control system. Within dedicated risk-control-matrixes we document the risks and corresponding controls for all relevant business processes with a particular focus on those processes located at the interface with external parties, such as merchandise buying. Still, our current internal controls, prevention (such as our anti-corruption policy) and training programs may prove to be insufficient. Our employees, agents or authorized persons may have been or could be engaged in activities for which we could be held liable on different legal grounds. We 41 ----- conduct business in, and may expand our business to, certain countries where corruption may be considered to be widespread. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that our employees, agents or other authorized persons could make payments or grant hidden benefits in violation of anti-corruption laws and regulations, especially in response to demands or attempts by individuals or entities to procure an illicit monetary benefit. Most laws and regulations promulgated against corruption and money laundering require us to implement certain controls, procedures, and internal regulations in order to ensure that the operations of a given entity do not involve corruption, illegal payments, or money-laundering. Although we engage in know-your-customer activities, the great diversity and complexity of these local laws and regulations and the expansive nature of the business conducted by us in various countries and markets create a risk that we may be deemed liable for violations of local laws and regulations. We are also subject to regulations concerning consumer protection, data protection, unsolicited commercial communications, general terms and conditions of contract, tax, child protection and telecommunications. Any violation or breach of these laws and regulations could affect our overall reputation and, depending on the case, expose us to administrative, criminal or civil proceedings, which could result in criminal and administrative fines and sanctions, confiscations and asset forfeitures, including possible prohibitions on maintaining business relationships with brand partners, fashion or lifestyle brands or customers in certain countries, which could have material adverse effects on the implementation of our business strategy as well as on our financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.25,We are subject to numerous laws and regulations with respect to data protection and failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in litigation and administrative or arbitration proceedings and/or significantly damage our relationship with our customers.,"We process sensitive customer data as part of our members-only business model. A fundamental requirement for online commerce and communications is the secure handling and transmission of confidential information, including credit card information, over public networks. We cannot exclude that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the systems we use to protect transactional and personal data. Both local and international laws and regulations govern our collection, use, retention, sharing and security of this personal data, including the GDPR which is effective since May 25, 2018. We as a data controller must implement specific technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data we collect depending on the amount of and potential risk for the personal data processed. In order to comply with the GDPR, we have also implemented a data protection organization. Among others, we have installed an external data protection officer. This officer monitors all measures associated with data protection, including group-wide training for existing and new employees. A breach of the GDPR or a failure to comply with other applicable data protection laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to us becoming subject to governmental investigations, fines, and private claims for compensation from individuals whose personal data was involved. In the event of such a personal data breach, we could be required to notify applicable government authorities (within a certain time period) and/or potential victims if the breach in question may pose a high risk to the rights of these victims. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position (e.g., the GDPR provides severe fines in case of infringements of up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover on a group basis, whichever is greater and depending on the respective breach for non-compliance with GDPR provisions). The need to comply with data protection legislation is a significant controlling, operational and reputational risk which can affect us in a number of ways including, for example, making it more difficult to maintain and expand our marketing data and also through potential litigation relating to the alleged misuse of personal data. While we have taken out cyber-security insurance, it cannot be certain that our insurance coverage concerning this and other risks will be adequate for liabilities that we might actually incur or that such insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. New and more stringent data protection laws, regulations or developments and changes in consumer behavior could interfere with our strategies to use privacy-related information for our marketing efforts and could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Current case law may also change our strategies. For example, the recent “Schrems II” ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union of July 16, 2020, provides that special care and safeguards must be taken when transferring personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA. This decision has greatly increased the legal requirements imposed on data exporters for transfers of personal data from EU-countries to non-EU countries, 42 ----- which are deemed to have an inadequate data protection level compared to the standards imposed in the EEA (including, amongst others, the United States). Ensuring compliance with changing and/or stricter standards requires resources to continuously review and, as necessary, replace, amend, or supplement the international data transfer mechanisms which we currently rely on, including corporate binding rules, standard contractual clauses, and adequate data processing agreements with our business partners. The resulting mechanisms and procedures may increase the expenses associated with our overall compliance with personal data protection requirements or even require us to discontinue using certain tools that are relevant to our business. Any non-compliance, including as a result of our use of Google Analytics and Amazon Web Services, could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation. Furthermore, existing, and future decisions by local governmental regulators may also impact the application of the GDPR. For example, in January 2022, the Austrian Data Protection Authority issued a decision that a company’s use of Google Analytics contravenes the GDPR with regard to potential data transfers to the US. Complying with such decisions could impose further costs on us and limit our ability to use data analytics software to support our operations. Additionally, significant modifications in other data protection laws or regulations in countries in which we operate may consequently lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices. Compliance will become more complex and involve higher costs and the increasing risk of noncompliance may give rise to civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief), fines or even criminal charges. Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber security breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches or physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access. If we or any third-party service providers on which we may rely fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, or if any such loss of personal customer data were otherwise to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws. Any such disclosure could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites and deter future purchases. Any failure to comply with local and international laws governing personal data or to protect our data from being misappropriated could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

These metrics are calculated using internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party and the metrics have not been validated by an independent third party. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose on an ongoing basis. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or over count performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we present may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used. Errors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies. For example, there are individuals who have multiple accounts on our platform. A user is separately identified on our platform by a unique e-mail address; a single person could have multiple accounts and can count as multiple distinct users. If a significant understatement or overstatement of active users were to occur, we may expend 43 ----- resources to implement unnecessary business measures or fail to take required actions to attract enough users to satisfy our growth strategies. Further, certain of the other information we collect from users, including personal data are self-reported and may differ from their actual data. Age and other demographic information may be inaccurate if our users provide us with incorrect or incomplete information regarding their age or other attributes or choose not to report this information.

Granting return rights is an important element for converting app and website visitors into customers, by providing our customers with the certainty that they will only be required to pay for those products that they want to keep. Moreover, we have a customer-friendly returns policy. It is possible that, in the future, a growing number of customers may abuse our returns policy and, for example, buy merchandise just to wear it once at a party and then return it, claiming it had arrived used. Further, we generally experience a higher return rate from customers who pay for our merchandise with invoices (in lieu of using standard payment platforms). Our failure to prevent abuse of our returns policy or to otherwise manage our returns policy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Certain of our online customers, including online customers in Germany, have statutory rights with respect to the return of merchandise. We have in the past and could in the future experience a significant increase in returns— for example, due to customer dissatisfaction with our products or customer service, changes in customer behavior, decrease in purchasing power due to inflationary pressures or the abuse of our liberal return policy by persons not actually willing to purchase our products. In this case, we incur costs associated with returned goods, including costs associated with return processing and delivery, but may not receive revenue from returns or proceeds from sales of returned goods may not cover all costs incurred. There is no guarantee that we will be able to utilize returned goods in a cost-efficient manner—for example, by reselling them on our apps and websites. In addition, we bear the risk for damage or loss of the merchandise. Thus, any increase in returns would increase our costs with no corresponding increase in revenue. Continued growth is likely to increase the absolute number of returns, which may force us to allocate additional resources to the handling of such returns and may further complicate our operations. Furthermore, any modification of our return policies may result in customer dissatisfaction, which could harm our reputation, or lead to an increase in the number of returns, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Any failure by us to meet our ESG commitments or targets, or loss of confidence, or inability to meet expectations with our ESG commitments on the part of customers, investors, employees, brand partners, and other stakeholders as it relates to our ESG initiatives could negatively impact our brand, our brand partner relationships, and the demand for our offerings. These impacts could be difficult and costly to overcome, even if such concerns were based on inaccurate or misleading information. Furthermore, while we believe we have an inherently sustainable business model (as most of the articles we sell are overstock and our model aims to ensure that every piece of fashion that has been produced and is fit-to-wear finds an owner), it is possible that our model will not be perceived as sustainable by customers, investors, employees, brand partners, and other stakeholders. If their perceptions of the sustainability of our model are negative, this could also negatively impact our business and reputation. In addition, achieving our ESG initiatives may result in increased costs in our supply chain, fulfillment, and/or corporate business operations. Standards regarding environmental, social, and governance initiatives could change and become more onerous for both for us and our third-party brand partners to meet successfully. Evolving data and research could undermine or refute our current claims and beliefs that we have made in reliance on current research, which could also result in additional costs or a decrease in revenue, and negative market perception that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 44 ----- A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, a company’s efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance with law and the role of a company’s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. In light of investors’ increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet society’s ESG expectations or achieve our financial goals. As part of our commitment to ESG matters, we are planning to introduce specific, quantifiable key performance indicators. If we fail to meet the targets of these or other key performance indicators, we may suffer reputational damage, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Based on our members-only business model, attracting new customers depends in part on word-of-mouth and the recommendations of existing customers to expand our customer base. We therefore must ensure that existing customers are satisfied with our convenience proposition, including content creation, usability of our online platform and app, check-out process, payment options, packaging and shipping and customer service, so that those customers continue to recommend us. Should our efforts to satisfy existing customers be unsuccessful, we may fail to continue expanding our business or may be obliged to incur significant marketing and development expenditure to attract new customers. For example, reliable customer support is vital to ensure that customer complaints are processed within appropriate timeframes and under satisfactory conditions. Providing this support requires that our customer support personnel have fashion, retail, technical, and other necessary knowledge and expertise, making it difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and scale our support operations. The demand on our customer service organization will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers, and such increased support could require us to devote significant development services and support personnel to our customer service teams, which could strain our team and infrastructure and reduce our profit margins. Any absence of a response or an unsatisfactory response to customer queries or complaints, whether founded or perceived as such, may have a detrimental impact on customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as our reputation, particularly if customers make negative comments on blogs, social media, or through online ratings and reviews. We may not be able to verify or adequately respond to such negative comments, ratings or reviews. An inability to retain customers and earn their loyalty, or to identify, follow up and respond to customer complaints and online comments due to customer service failings, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.31,We are exposed to risks associated to the payment options we offer.,"We currently offer different payment methods tailored to meet our customers’ payment preferences, including credit cards, PayPal, direct debit, instant bank transfer and purchase by invoice. We face the risk of operational failures during the check-out process in our e-commerce platform as well as our retail stores relating to the complexity of certain payment methods. Such difficulties could adversely affect our conversion rate which is the proportion of site visitors that actually complete the purchasing process. We may also become subject to additional or changing regulations regarding certain payment methods, such as the operating rules and certification requirements of payment scheme associations and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which apply to payment cards, whether in general or in a particular country in which we operate. We may also become subject to more stringent or complex compliance requirements, for example with respect to our vouchers. For the processing of all our current payment methods we pay different fees to our payment method providers. It is possible that some of these fees would increase over time, causing our expenses to rise. In the case of invoice payments, even though the default risk currently lies with our service provider, a high non-payment rate will lead to either increased costs for us or a lowered acceptance rate for customers using this payment method. Furthermore, different payment options have different costs to us (e.g., PayPal is much more expensive than direct debit) and should customers shift their preferences in favor of the more expensive payment methods, then our expenses would rise accordingly. Furthermore, various types of fraud committed through payments may increase our overall cost. These types of fraud vary, and range from account take-overs, usage of stolen credit cards, fake identities, fake bank accounts, to “almost legal fraud” like voucher abusing or the creation of multiple accounts to take advantage of our loyalty system. In case of excessive fraud events relating to credit card transactions, in addition to the direct losses, we 45 ----- could enter the card schemes’ chargeback monitoring programs, where we could incur extra fees and even lose the right to accept cards altogether. For online payments, primary liability for fraud generally lies with the party with the lowest security standards, which, in most cases, is the merchant. While strong authentication methods such as two-factor authentication, can help us alleviate some of this risk, we consciously elect to forego the strongest authentication methods because the added hurdle for the customer would detract from a seamless customer experience. Further, some payment methods, such as unsecured direct debits, have by design no authorization mechanism and thus we bear significant risk.

This audit for the years 2014 to 2017 commenced in November 2020 and was_ formally completed in May 2022 by final assessments. The audit included all German entities of the BestSecret Group, and included the acquisition by PrestigeBidCo GmbH in the 2016-2017 period and yielded payments due covered by provisions. Furthermore, tax audits for periods or jurisdictions not yet subject to a tax audit may exceed the taxes already paid by us or reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, we may be required to make additional tax payments with respect to previous periods. Moreover, the competent tax authorities could revise their original tax assessments. Any tax assessments that deviate from our expectations could lead to an increase in our tax burden. In addition, we may be required to pay interest on these additional taxes as well as late filing penalties. Furthermore, we have carried out reorganizations of the Group structure, and there is a risk that any such restructuring could attract additional tax scrutiny or result in a tax leakage despite our best efforts to avoid such negative tax consequences (e.g., obtaining tax advisory services by reputable consultants who confirmed the tax neutrality of the Group structure reorganizations). Due to our operations in various jurisdictions, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, we are exposed to various tax risks, including risks based on transfer pricing rules which apply to cross-border business relationships, for example, purchase, logistics, distribution or commission agreements or other arrangements. Pursuant to such transfer pricing rules, related enterprises are required to conduct any inter-company transactions on terms which would also apply among unrelated third parties concluding comparable agreements (so-called “arm’s length principle”) and to sufficiently document the relevant transactions. One or more tax authorities might not agree with, and thus challenge the cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing model we implemented. For example, our documentation may be considered to be insufficient by the relevant tax authorities or transfer prices may be considered to be inadequate or inadequately justified. This may result in double taxation in two or more jurisdictions and penalties. Moreover, transfer pricing risks may increase in the future in case our intra-group cross-border business grows or changes or if tax authorities change their interpretation of applicable transfer pricing rules. Furthermore, the documentation obligations under applicable value-added tax (“VAT”) and VAT-related laws are considerable. Overall, it cannot be ruled out that the competent tax authorities may interpret the tax law (now or in the future) in a way that suggests that we may not fully comply, or, as the case may be, may have not fully complied with applicable VAT regulations throughout all phases of their development. Any additional tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We are also subject to transfer pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies pursuant to, for example, purchase, logistics, distribution or commission agreements or other arrangements.

In addition, a certain proportion of our personnel working on technology related matters are classed as external employees. In the event of departure of one or more of these key and qualified personnel, we may not be able to replace them quickly, which could affect our operational performance. More generally, we may be unable to recruit new personnel whose skills and industry experience are equivalent to those of our key and qualified personnel or could fail to attract and retain experienced personnel in the future. In addition, should our executives or key employees join a competitor or create a competing business, it could have a negative impact on our operations. Furthermore, many of our procurement employees have good relationships with brand partners, many of which have developed over decades. If we are not able to retain these employees, we may fail to maintain or further develop these relationships with brand partners. If we fail to attract, train, motivate or retain skilled personnel or if our operations are affected over a longer period of time by labor disputes or if we are forced to enter into a collective bargaining agreement at unfavorable terms, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and our reputation.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We may face considerable wage increases in the future, for example in connection with statutory minimum wages, current inflation dynamics or otherwise as a result of generally rising wages. If we are not successful in limiting such increases in personnel costs, or if cost increases cannot be passed on to our customers, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. While a limited number of our own employees at Best Secret Retail Wien GmbH are bound by two collective bargaining agreements for employees and apprentices in commercial operations, with the remainder not currently subject to any collective bargaining agreement, there can be no assurance that labor disputes, work stoppages, strikes or similar actions will not occur in the future which might urge us to adopt or negotiate further collective bargaining agreements. Any material disagreements between us and our employees could disrupt our operations, lead to a loss in revenue and customers and increase our operating costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that collective bargaining would be possible on terms that are satisfactory to us. In addition, since certain of our operations, including work in our fulfillment centers, are labor intensive, maintaining good relationships with our employees is crucial to our operations. We have in the past had, and may in future have, difficulty recruiting employees to work in our fulfillment centers. Any deterioration in our relationship with our workforce could lead to us or one of our service providers not being able to recruit enough labor to support our growth even if we increase pay. While currently none of the Group’s employees are represented by works councils (Betriebsrat) and no supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) has been established at our main operating company Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH to date, this may, depending on the development of the employee base, change in the future and our employees may establish works councils and we may be required to implement a supervisory board at Best Secret GmbH and Best Secret Logistik GmbH according to the German One-Third Participation Act (Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz) or the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz), as the case may be. As a consequence, we would be required, inter alia, to involve such bodies in certain decision-making processes, which may limit our operational flexibility and our ability to react to corporate developments in a timely manner. Any deterioration of such relationships in the future or any material work stoppages, strikes or other types of conflicts with our employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

For example, in 2016 we acquired Swiss Online Shopping AG as part of our expansion into Switzerland, which, at the time of acquisition and during the following months, was generating losses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable targets and consummate an acquisition on favorable terms or at all. It is also possible that not all material risks in connection with acquisitions will be identified in the due diligence process and that such risks will not be taken into account in the decision-making process or the respective agreements to a sufficient level or at all. In addition, future acquisitions may also entail financial and tax 47 ----- restructuring measures which, even if designed with the aim of achieving a tax-efficient structure, may expose us to risks, e.g., if the tax authorities were to challenge any of the implemented measures. Upon making acquisitions, our performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient manner. Such integration may be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process and will likely involve a number of risks, including the costs and expenses associated with unexpected difficulties, initial or ongoing losses in periods following the acquisition, the diversion of management’s attention from our daily operations, additional demands on management related to the increase in the size and scope of our operations following an acquisition and any undisclosed liabilities of an acquired company. Even if we are able to successfully integrate newly-acquired businesses, this integration may not result in the realization of the synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, operational efficiencies and other benefits that we expect. We may also incur unexpected liabilities in connection with such acquisitions. If these liabilities are significant or if we fail to integrate a new acquisition effectively, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.37,"We are subject to a variety of regulations, including but not limited to laws governing data protection, telemedia services, consumer protection, foreign trade and customs, packaging, cyber security as well as competition laws, and future regulations might impose additional requirements and other obligations on our business.","We are, or in the future may be, subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to e-commerce or fashion, as well as laws and regulations of broader application that apply to our business and to public companies generally. These laws and regulations cover, among other things, data protection, telemedia services, consumer protection, textile labeling, packaging, cyber security, taxation, tariffs, anti-bribery, antitrust, pricing and discounting, content, copyrights, trademarks, distribution, mobile, social media and other communication, advertising practices, electronic contracts, sales procedures, environmental protection, unencumbered internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of goods that are offered online. Furthermore, as the internet continues to revolutionize commercial relationships on a global scale, and as the use of the internet and mobile devices in everyday life becomes ever more prevalent, these laws continue to evolve at a rapid pace and can differ, or be subject to differing interpretations, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Existing and future regulations and laws relating to the internet may impede the growth and availability of the internet and online services, inhibit our ability to grow our business, or adversely affect our business by increasing costs and administrative burdens. In addition, various legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, may extend the scope of current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection and consumer protection. For example, the European Commission’s Digital Single Market (“DSM”) initiative is resulting in, and is expected to continue to result in, additional rules on e-commerce or data protection, information security and privacy, which may increase our compliance costs or affect our business model. Furthermore, with regard to the production of economic goods, on June 11, 2021, the German federal parliament (Bundestag) adopted the so-called Supply Chain Duty of Care Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz), which imposes comprehensive due diligence, documentation, and reporting obligations on companies in the field of human rights and environmental protection. It is required to carefully document the whole value chain, conduct risk analyses, set up human rights responsibilities, diligently review suppliers, and provide for risk mitigation and detection, such as grievance mechanisms, as well as remedial actions. The Supply Chain Duty of Care Act will make companies responsible for counteracting adverse impact on human rights and the environment with respect to their business operations. However, from January 1, 2023, the Supply Chain Duty of Care Act will only be applicable to companies with at least 3,000 employees in Germany. From January 1, 2024, companies with at least 1,000 employees in Germany will be covered as well. Therefore, our business does not have to comply with the Supply Chain Duty of Care Act until the later date. In addition, due to our international footprint we may be subject to further domestic supply chain laws that have extraterritorial scope, and their due diligence requirements. In addition to the Supply Chain Duty of Care Act, we will be subject to further laws and regulations initiated by the EU and the Supply Chain Duty of Care Act may be subject to amendments based on EU regulations. In particular, the forthcoming EU Taxonomy, as well as the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive, will impose reporting requirements regarding targets and economic activities related to social responsibility and environmental protection. Such legislation will require us to further adapt our compliance systems to manage new legal and operational risks, which will require us to devote more resources to our compliance function and could also require us to adapt our business model. 48 ----- Given the broad variety of applicable rules and their evolving nature, we cannot guarantee that our practices have complied or will comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations. Any failure, actual or perceived, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and a loss of revenue, and any legal or enforcement action brought against us as a result of actual or alleged non-compliance could further damage our reputation and result in substantially increased legal expenses. Adverse changes in laws or regulations applicable to us could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy effectively. Any compliance failure may also give rise to civil liability, administrative orders (including injunctive relief), fines or even criminal charges. Additionally, the global nature of the internet and telecommunications technology can make it difficult to ensure that our websites, advertisements, and content remain within the scope of their intended audience. Moreover, despite our efforts to comply with local regulatory requirements, our websites and advertisements could be made available by third parties in areas where their dissemination violates local requirements, and we could face penalties and damage to our reputation. Finally, certain jurisdictions may attempt to levy novel sales, income, or other taxes on our internet-based activities. New taxes could increase our cost of doing business and expose us to penalties. Any such increased costs, penalties, reputational damage, or increased costs associated with maintaining compliance in different regulatory environments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.38,Climate change and related regulatory responses as well as customer awareness may adversely impact our business.,"There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in weather patterns and an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather conditions could, among other things, adversely impact the cultivation of cotton, which is a key resource our suppliers use to make the products that we sell, disrupt our suppliers’ supply chain operations, increase the cost of our suppliers’ products, and impact the types of products that customers purchase. As a result, the effects of climate change could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In many countries, governmental bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change. These laws have the potential to impact our operations indirectly as a result of required compliance by our suppliers and the manufacturers of their products. In addition, we are active in an industry that is not considered to be environmentally sustainable, and we depend on shipping logistics, which lead to a high emission of carbon dioxide. As a result, our customers might refuse to acquire merchandise from us and turn to more sustainable competitors or reduce or refrain from acquiring fashion products. If we take steps to voluntarily mitigate our impact on climate change, we may experience increases in energy and transportation costs, capital expenditures or insurance premiums and deductibles. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations, or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate or conduct business. In addition, apart from legislative developments we see a growing risk stemming from emerging climate change litigation globally. The rise of so-called “strategic litigation networks” that are targeting specific industries with particular forms of litigation while forum shopping in various jurisdictions constitutes a significant risk for our business that is difficult to assess.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We have in the past been, and in the future may be, subject to claims and allegations of infringement of third parties’ intellectual property rights. Brand and content owners and other proprietary rights owners have actively asserted their purported rights against online companies, including the Group. In particular, we have in the past received, and in future may receive, cease-and-desist letters from fashion brands requesting that we cease importing merchandise that allegedly infringes upon their intellectual property. Infringement of third parties’ intellectual property rights could subject us to significant liability for damages. Such claims may in the future result, and have in the past resulted, in our goods being seized by customs authorities as part of investigations into intellectual property infringement claims. The costs of defending against such actions can be high, and there is no guarantee that such defenses will be successful. Such actions could also result in the diversion of our management’s time and attention. Moreover, infringement of third parties’ intellectual property rights may result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property or in the prohibition of using the 49 ----- intellectual property at all, subject to the respective claims, unless we are able to enter into agreements with the intellectual property owners. Furthermore, as our business expands and the number of competitors in our market increases, infringement claims against us could increase in number and significance. In addition to litigation from rights owners, we may be subject to regulatory, civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental authorities believe we have aided and abetted in the sale of counterfeit or other unlawful products. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in significant additional expenses, redirect management attention, and have an adverse effect on our reputation as well as on our financial condition. Legal claims regarding intellectual property rights are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complex issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims. Many potential litigants have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources than we do to the enforcement of intellectual property rights and defense of claims that may be brought against them. If successful, a claimant could secure a judgment against us for substantial damages or prevent us from conducting our business as we have historically done so or may desire to do so in the future. We could also be required to seek authorization or make payments in order to use of the intellectual property we need to conduct our business, which we may not be able to achieve on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be forced to develop non-infringing intellectual property on a proprietary basis, which could be expensive and/or unsuccessful. We use third-party software on the basis of software license agreements. We may not have sufficient licenses to cover the actual scope of use of such software in our business operations, which may require us to pay compensation to, and to acquire further licenses from, the owners of the rights in the relevant software. In addition, we may be required to obtain further licenses to enhance our business operations, and we may also be required to change the current software providers and enter into agreements with new software providers with less favorable terms.

We anticipate that this new fulfillment center will be fully ramped up in 2024. Once the fulfillment center in Poland is completed, we will be exposed to additional currency risk. Such risks arise due to fluctuations or devaluations of currencies, inflation and foreign exchange controls or governmental measures that impact our ability to convert currencies. In addition, where parts of the cost of sales are not denominated in the same currency of such sales, translation risks arise.

There is a great deal of uncertainty as to how sustained these, and any further, price increases may be, including increases in energy, freight transport and labor costs. Rising inflation has and could continue to put additional pressure on households’ budgets, adversely affecting consumer confidence and consumer spending in the fashion segment, leading to lower sales volumes and a negative impact on our financial results.

Furthermore, we carry insurance covering cyber risks. Cyber risks are insured up to €10 million. We are also exposed to risks related to the health and safety of our employees and contractors as well as other workplace safety risks. As our uniform health and safety standards are mainly issued to our German facilities, each region is working under different standards and are at varying stages of maturity and there exists only limited control in this space. Additionally, documentation and record keeping of safety records may prove insufficient to substantiate to regulators that our health and safety systems are operating effectively. If staff and contractors get injured during the course of their duties we may, among other things, face fines and penalties from regulators as well as damage to our reputation. 50 ----- We are furthermore exposed to risks due to external factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, accidents, vandalism, natural hazards, acts of terrorism, damage and loss caused by fire, power failures or other events, that could potentially lead to personal injuries, damage to third-party property or the environment or the interruption of our business operations. Accidents or other incidents that occur at our offices and workshops or involve our personnel or operations could result in claims for damages against us and could damage our reputation. We may not always be able to accurately foresee all situations that should otherwise be covered by the terms of our insurance policies and, as a result, we may not be covered by insurance in specific instances. While we believe we maintain appropriate levels of insurance consistent with industry practice, we may experience incidents of a nature that are not covered by insurance. As a result, the amount of any costs, including fines or damages that we might incur in such circumstances, could substantially exceed any insurance we have to cover such losses. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages within a given year may have an adverse effect on our insurance premiums. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. We may not be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.

Credit levels available to us from our suppliers remain dependent on the general economic environment and our financial position. If there is a significant decrease in the availability of credit insurance to our suppliers, or if an increase in credit levels is administered too slowly or such insurance is withdrawn in its entirety, and if such suppliers are unwilling or unable to take credit risk themselves or find alternative credit sources, they may choose to reduce their credit exposure to us, for example by seeking to change their credit terms vis-à-vis our Group.

Changes in tax legislation, administrative practice or case law or treatments of tax facts by the relevant tax authorities which deviate from our assessments — and might be applied retroactively — could result in a higher tax burden. The realization of any of these risks, alone or in combination, may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, developments in tax law, regulation, or case law, with regards to transnational e-commerce activities could affect our tax burden. Since 2017, the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework has been working on addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy and agreed on a two-pillar tax approach with pillar one referring to the re-allocation of taxing rights, addressing issues such as where tax should be paid and on what basis (i.e., where sustained and significant business is conducted, regardless of a physical presence), and pillar two ensuring a minimum tax to be paid by multinational enterprises. The implementation of this approach could have adverse effects for us as a digital and multinational enterprise with regards to our tax obligations. Changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect the commercial use of our sites and our financial results. For example, some jurisdictions in which we operate our business (e.g., Italy) have introduced new local taxes on transnational e-commerce activities (“digital services taxes” or “DST”). These DST generally aim at securing taxation rights of the jurisdiction for the revenue / profit generated by the transnational e-commerce activities with customers who are resident in this specific jurisdiction. We have established a process to assess on a regular (i.e., quarterly) basis whether our revenue / profit are subject to these DST. For 2020, it was concluded that there should be no such DST liability. In the context of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework certain states generally agreed upon mitigating their existing DST and abstaining from introducing new DST before the earlier of December 31, 2023 or the date pillar one rules become effective but there remains a general risk that new local DST will be introduced or that the 51 ----- existing DST will be applied differently with the result that this could adversely affect our tax liability. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on e-commerce. New or revised taxes – e.g., sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes – could increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling products over the internet. New taxes could also lead to increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes to the relevant tax authorities which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. Moreover, legislators and tax authorities may change territoriality rules or their interpretation for the application of VAT on cross-border services, which may lead to additional payments for past and future periods. In addition, court decisions are sometimes ignored by competent tax authorities or overruled by higher courts, which could lead to higher legal and tax advisory costs and create uncertainty. New taxes could also result in additional costs necessary to collect the data required to assess these taxes and to remit them to the relevant tax authorities which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We own a number of intellectual property rights, including trademarks and trade names, which, along with related internet domain names, are important to our business. Certain of these intellectual property rights have in the past been, and in the future may be, infringed by third parties. We regularly register our trademarks and trade names in Europe and other markets. We are the registrant of the Best Secret trademark in numerous jurisdictions and have also registered various internet domain names containing _e.g., our brand names for our websites combined with the relevant top-level domain in those jurisdictions in which we are active, _e.g., www.bestsecret.com, or event names for events we are carrying out under our brand. Additionally, we have registered many trademarks of our private labels in numerous jurisdictions. We have also registered selected internet domain names for some of our proprietary brands and labels. Domain names are generally regulated by internet regulatory bodies and are also subject to the trademark laws and other related laws of each country in which we currently operate. As we seek to register our trademarks in new jurisdictions, we may encounter opposition which may hinder our ability to continue to register our trademarks as desired, and, furthermore, registration can be a lengthy process. Registration of intellectual property rights, especially trademarks, which we have applied for or intend to apply for in the future may be denied in countries where we consider registration necessary or desirable. As a result, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using the same or similar intellectual property rights. Same or similar third-party trademarks and internet domain names may already exist in jurisdictions where we operate or intend to operate, and we may be restricted from using the relevant trademark or internet domain name in the respective jurisdiction. Our registered intellectual property rights, especially trademarks, may be subject to cancellation and as a result third parties would be free to use such intellectual property rights. For any particular country, if we do not have, or cannot obtain or maintain on reasonable terms, the ability to use our trademarks or a major proprietary brand, or to use or register our domain name, we could be forced either to incur significant additional expenses to market our products within that country—including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials and packaging—or elect not to sell products in that country. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, including our domain names. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights, domain names and other proprietary rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights, domain names or proprietary rights or to establish the validity of such rights. Despite 52 ----- our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights, domain names and other proprietary rights, leading to a decrease in the value of such rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expenses for us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. This may also lead to a weakening of the goodwill that is associated with our brands and may undermine our reputation. Furthermore, the regulations governing domain names and laws protecting marks and similar proprietary rights could change in ways that block or interfere with our ability to use relevant domains or our current brands. Regulatory bodies may establish additional generic or country-code top-level domains or may allow modifications of the requirements for registering, holding, or using domain names. As a result, we might not be able to register, use or maintain the domain names that utilize our brand names in all of the countries in which we currently conduct business or intend to conduct business in the future. If we are unable to obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property and defend it against third parties, we may not be able to advance our business.

We use e-mail newsletters, app push notifications and other messaging services in order to promote our platform, inform customers of our product offerings and the status of their transactions. We cannot exclude that such marketing activities due to a mistake by one of our employees may breach laws governing marketing conduct, in particular the German Act Against Unfair Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb). Any perceived or actual breach of such laws could subject us to litigation and may prevent us from certain marketing conduct or may require us to change existing advertising campaigns, for example with respect to e-mail advertising or the use of certain advertising claims. We may have to expend significant financial and human resources to defend such claims and adjust our internal processes. Restrictions on our current or planned marketing activities could affect our competitive position and any resulting decrease in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our pricing or prices on individual items, in particular with respect to references that we may make to comparative prices or original prices, could be incorrect, which could lead to notices, warnings by competitors or other market participants. As a consequence, we have in the past been, and could in the future be, required to adjust the presentation of our price comparisons. Our competitors may use certain marketing activities to attract customers in a manner that breaches laws governing marketing conduct.

Many of these laws and regulations are complex and difficult to interpret. Moreover, as we expand our international operations to target customers in additional countries, we will be subjected to additional laws and regulatory regimes. The legal and regulatory frameworks governing our business and operations may become increasingly uncertain due to quickly changing laws, contradictory interpretation of laws and regulations, administrative bypassing of legal frameworks or a lack of market precedents upon which we can rely. Our international business is subject to laws and regulations in many areas, including those governing product safety, local employment, privacy, data security, telecommunications, online content, intellectual property protection, corporate governance, foreign ownership and foreign investment, tax, finance, money laundering, online payment, anti-corruption and antitrust. These various laws and regulations often evolve and sometimes conflict with each other. Furthermore, operating in foreign jurisdictions entails an inherent risk of misinterpreting and wrongly implementing foreign laws and regulations. While we are not aware of any material breach by us of any applicable laws and regulations, we cannot rule out that we have not been in full compliance with these laws and regulations in the past. 53 ----- International sanctions may negatively affect our operations. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has and will potentially continue to have a wide range of supply chain implications, including increases in costs to source materials and disruption in freight transport. Additionally, some of the tax systems in our countries of operations are very complex and there is no guarantee that the relevant tax authorities agree with the positions we have taken or the tax optimization structures and measures we have used to minimize legal risks, administrative burdens and tax rates. The application of foreign direct investment laws and regulations, license rules and similar rules and regulations is also often unclear. These laws and regulations are subject to multiple interpretations, e.g., by different courts, regulators, and other players in the legal community, which may differ from the interpretations to which we have adhered. In other countries, changes in the political or legal climate may impact our use of local currency and local banking. Similarly, we are bound by extended waiting periods and complex and costly administrative approval processes and registration. As these laws continue to evolve and as we expand into new jurisdictions, our compliance efforts will become more complex and expensive, and the risk of non-compliance will increase. Violations of applicable laws and regulations may harm our reputation and result in legal action, criminal and civil sanctions, or administrative fines and penalties against us or members of our governing bodies and our employees. Such violations may also result in damage claims by third parties or other adverse legal consequences, including class action lawsuits and enforcement actions by national and international regulators resulting in the limitation or prohibition of business operations. There is no guarantee that we can successfully manage or avoid any of the legal risks to which we are exposed, and non-compliance with the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern our operations, whether intentional or not, may have material adverse effects on our businesses, including causing us to cease our operations entirely.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Because we operate in different countries, we could face difficulties and increased costs relating to compliance with numerous different regulatory regimes and monitoring ongoing regulatory action. Regulatory changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage, causing us to lose customers and income. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines and exposure to potential liability claims from customers or third parties. Additionally, the global nature of the internet and telecommunications technology can make it difficult to ensure that our websites, advertisements and content remain within the scope of their intended audience. Moreover, despite our efforts to comply with local regulatory requirements, our websites and advertisements could be made available by third parties in areas where their dissemination violates local requirements, and we could face penalties and damage to our reputation. Finally, certain jurisdictions may attempt to levy novel sales, income or other taxes on our internet-based activities. New taxes could increase our cost of doing business and expose us to penalties.

Adverse judgments or determinations in one or more of these proceedings may require us to change the way we do business or use substantial resources in adhering to settlements or pay fines or other penalties. The costs related to such proceedings may be significant, and, even if there is a positive outcome, we may still have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants, insurance or otherwise. This may undermine our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. See “Our Business—Litigation.” Any such proceedings, even if we are successful, could divert management resources, incur certain expenses and cause damage to our reputation.

While we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with all applicable product safety and consumer protection laws and regulations, the sale of defective products might result in product recalls, product liability claims and/or administrative fines or criminal charges against us or our management. As we are the “responsible person” for private label and third-party merchandise that we offer, within the context of the applicable regulations on product safety applicable to our merchandise, any quality defect could lead (based on EU law or similar applicable national laws) to customer claims, administrative or criminal proceedings and penalties. Our third-party suppliers as well as our own private label brands’ reputation could be damaged by any such claims, proceedings and penalties. Even if an event causing a product recall proves to be unfounded or if a product liability claim against us is unsuccessful, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that products sold by us caused injury or damage, or any allegation that the goods sold by us were defective, could adversely affect our reputation with both existing and potential customers as well as our corporate and brand image. We also face risks associated with environmental, animal-rights and sustainability concerns. For example, any negative publicity campaigns concerning low-priced, short-lived fashion items may negatively affect our reputation or our sales. Similarly, negative publicity associated with the sale of fashion items manufactured using fur or other animal-sourced products may negatively affect our reputation or our sales. We are further exposed to risks in relation to possible breaches of corporate social responsibility, including ethical sourcing, working conditions, child labor and responsible recruitment, which may harm our reputation and prospects. For example, if improper working conditions are found or alleged to exist at one or more of the factories in which the fashion and lifestyle products 55 ----- we sell are manufactured, or if there is a major injury or loss-of-life incident in such factories, we could face negative publicity that could damage our reputation and the perception of our own labels, and we may be required to pay fines, face enhanced scrutiny by regulators or be subjected to other adverse legal consequences. Against the backdrop of the Supply Chain Duty of Care Act being applicable in the future, the aforementioned risks may increase. We also work with employment agencies that provide us with workers to fill open positions. We face the risk that these agencies may provide workers who do not have the necessary legal documentation. It is also possible that these agencies or other service providers may use illicit means to obtain such documentation, which increases underlying risks as human trafficking, modern slavery and forced labor. In cases where we become aware of material violations, we ask our business partners to remedy the situation. If they fail to do so, we terminate our cooperation with the relevant partner and do not employ the suggested workers. Yet, any such termination may affect our operations and reputation. It can also result in legal liability (including criminal liability) for non-compliance with human rights, international labor standards and specific criminal provisions, such as forced labor. Additionally, deficiencies in the area of corporate social responsibility may also negatively affect our recruiting efforts or disrupt our business if a large number of workers were disqualified from employment due to a lack of proper legal documentation as well as if our business partners terminate relationships with us due to reputational implications. There is a rise of strategic litigation focusing on forced labor allegations in the garment industry, which could negatively affect our reputation and business should we become targets of such litigation.

Although we do not intend to use or modify open-source software without holding the necessary licenses, we could, however, face claims from third parties alleging the infringement of their intellectual property rights or demanding the release or license of the open-source software or derivative works developed by us using such software (which could include our proprietary source code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. These claims could result in litigation, require us to purchase a license, publicly release the affected portions of our source code, and limit the licensing of our technologies or cease offering the implicated solutions. In addition, use of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide contractual protections with respect to the software. Also, the licensors are not obliged to maintain their software or provide any support. There is a certain risk that the authors of the open-source software cease updating and attending to the software. Engineering the software updates by ourselves could be expensive and time-consuming. The use of open-source software can also present additional security risks because the source code for open-source software is publicly available, which could make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our sites and systems that rely on open-source software. Any unauthorized access to our systems as well as third-party challenges to our user rights and claims regarding the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could divert our management’s attention from day-to-day tasks, incur significant legal costs and thus have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We are also planning to introduce standardized purchase and supply agreements with certain suppliers. If such documents, contracts or terms and conditions are interpreted in a way that is disadvantageous to us, or if clauses in such documents or contracts are declared invalid and thus displaced by statutory provisions which are unfavorable to us, a large number of standardized documents, contracts or terms and conditions could be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Additionally, standardized contractual terms have to comply with the statutory law on general terms and conditions. For example, under German law standardized contractual terms (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen) are subject to rigid fairness controls by the courts regarding their content and the way they, or legal concepts described therein, are presented to the other contractual party by the person using them. This applies, in particular, when they are used vis-à-vis consumers. Generally, standardized terms are invalid if they are not transparent, clearly worded, or if they are unbalanced or discriminate against the other party inappropriately. Due to the frequent changes to the legal framework, particularly with regard to court decisions relating to general terms and conditions, we cannot fully protect ourselves against risks arising from the use of such standardized contractual terms. Even if documents, contracts and terms and conditions are prepared with legal advice, it is not impossible to avoid all potential risks from the outset or in the future, as the changes may continue to occur in the legal framework, particularly through case law.

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Furthermore, if we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries under the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which Restricted Subsidiaries may not engage.

Credit risk in these countries and in other Eurozone countries could have a negative impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual euro member states. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and more recently in Ukraine and other world events could adversely affect the economies of the European Union (which continues to be the primary region in which we generate our revenue) and those of other countries. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Commission and EU member states to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe, the overall stability of the Eurozone, the influx of refugees in certain European countries and the rise of populism in Europe. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. On March 29, 2017, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom officially triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, signaling the start of a two-year period in which the United Kingdom would negotiate the terms of its exit (“Brexit”) from the European Union. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020, and in May 2021, the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which governs the future trading relationship between the parties, entered into force. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on consumer demand in the end markets where our customers operate. The resulting political and economic uncertainty could also lead to further calls for other governments of other member states of the European Union to consider withdrawal from the European Union or the abandonment of the euro as a currency. Such developments, or the perception that any such developments could occur, could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, the stability of the global economy and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the euro as a currency, or the reintroduction of an individual currency in Germany, could have major negative effects on our existing contractual relations with our customers, and could adversely affect the economy in Germany, where we provide products and services to our customers. In particular, the departure of Germany from the euro would increase our exposure to changes in currency rates. In addition, the departure of Germany from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of, inter alia, exchange rate control laws. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance our liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The potentially severe impact of these events on Europe and the global financial system could also have a negative impact on the value and marketability of the Notes. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro, such as supply contracts, would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our trading environment and the value of the Notes, and could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding euro-denominated debt obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Furthermore, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will contain covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile—We are subject to _restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.” Certain such covenants impose limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the_ amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur).

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests granted in favor of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral in certain jurisdictions. For example, under German law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the applicable Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge 63 ----- the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in the courts of these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Note Guarantees. Finally, the provision of Note Guarantees and execution of the Collateral will be subject to certain agreed security principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or security providers of the obligation to provide guarantees and/or grant security interests in assets otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could have a material adverse impact on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Some reforms are already effective, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented. EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time). In addition, the development of future alternatives to EURIBOR may result in the Notes performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR had not developed. The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate successor rate, which means that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Notes issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the 64 ----- _Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and_ the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt.

In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest and the Indenture will provide that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee/security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under German or other applicable law or without resulting in a breach of any applicable law, and enforcement of each Note Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial 67 ----- assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, in case of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Note Guarantees or the security interests granted under the Security Documents, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”) and, if payment had already_ been made under a Note Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found, inter alia, that: - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; - the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant Note Guarantee/security interests and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee/security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or - the relevant Note Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider. Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or custodian (Sachwalter) may challenge (anfechten) transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) or acts (Rechtshandlungen) that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. In addition, in Germany, there are significant restrictions on subsidiary guarantees and the granting of security interests for shareholder liabilities to the extent the proceeds under such liabilities are not on-lent by the shareholder to such subsidiary guarantors or such guarantees and security interests do otherwise benefit from exemptions from German capital maintenance rules, such exemptions being recognized for obligations rendered within a domination or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs-oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) or if a valuable claim for compensation or repayment exists (Bestehen eines vollwertigen Gegenleistungs-oder _Rückgewähranspruches)._ Furthermore, the payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Note Guarantees and Security Documents. There can be no assurances that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Note Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we pay dividends. In addition, the payment under the Note Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial 68 ----- uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

If such a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the New Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources (see “—The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon _cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes”). If an event constituting a Change of Control_ occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes under the terms of structurally senior indebtedness, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the change of control offer with respect to the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent is not obtained and such refinancing is not successful, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness.

Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are all non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Germany. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

We provide our customers with exclusive access to a portfolio of around 3,000 brands, while offering our brand partners a structural solution to sell their overstock through a discreet and controlled channel and protecting their brand equity. With a heritage going back nearly 100 years, we have evolved from an offline retail business to a tech-driven online platform. We offer a wide range of midmarket to luxury fashion brands at attractive discounts ranging from 20% to 80%, providing a permanent assortment of approximately 250,000 items at any moment in time. Our online offering is available in multiple languages and in 27 European countries. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, we generated revenue of 78 ----- €996.3 million, an Adjusted EBITDA of €131.4 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.2%. Our online revenue, which accounted for 91.7% of total revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, grew at a CAGR of 41.2% from the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 to the twelve months ended March 31, 2022. While 70.1% of our revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 was generated in Germany, our international business outside of Germany continues to gain in importance relative to our Germany business and experienced strong revenue growth of 86.3% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 (with a CAGR of 62.2% from the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 to the twelve months ended March 31, 2022).",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We operate in the European online fashion market for mid-market to luxury brands, primarily in the dedicated online off-price sector. We have also expanded into the discounted in-season and end-of-season sector. The overall European fashion market (excluding the U.K. and Russia) amounted to €310 billion in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 based on analysis prepared by a leading international consultancy firm and the Company. We operate in the dedicated online off-price sector and discounted in-season and end-of-season sector, which amounted to €44 billion in revenue across Europe (excluding the U.K. and Russia) in the year ended December 31, 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% from 2021 to 2025 based on analysis prepared by a leading international consultancy firm and the Company. In recent years, we have transformed into a primarily online platform for off-price premium products. Revenue from our online operations nearly doubled between the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2021 as a result of continued customer growth, strong international business development and an accelerated shift towards e-commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this growth, our online sales represented 93.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 77% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. From January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021, our number of active online customers increased at a CAGR of 35%. We plan to maintain a limited physical presence of premium and outlet stores in strategic locations designed primarily to support our online platform, with offline revenue expected to remain a limited percentage of our total revenue. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, governments across Europe imposed measures that resulted in the temporary closure of stores as well as strict social distancing rules and hygiene regulations between periods of closure. These closures had an adverse impact on our customer sales at offline stores, including at our retail stores in Dresden, Munich, Dornach and Vienna. The German offline retail sector decreased by 30% and 12% during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively, compared to the previous year due to government-enforced store closures, the ongoing consumer shift away from offline platforms to online platforms, and low frequency in customer store visits (Textilwirtschaft). In contrast, the German online fashion retail sector increased by 21% and 16% in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively, compared to the previous year. The European online fashion market (excluding the U.K., Russia and Turkey) achieved revenue of €107 billion and €119 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which was an increase of 29% and 11%, respectively, over the previous year (Statista). While we believe that our business model is resilient to minor general economic effects, it is possible that unfavorable macroeconomic events in Germany, and more broadly in Europe, may have a negative effect on the growth of the European online fashion market and impact our customers and our results of operations. These include factors that may affect consumer spending such as unemployment levels, inflation, wage rates, availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence. For example, recent geopolitical tensions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine have destabilized the global economy and will potentially have a wide range of supply chain implications, including increases in the costs of merchandise and disruption in freight transport. 79 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.2.2,Our ability to secure an attractive variety and quantity of products,"Our results of operations and profitability depend, to a considerable extent, on our ability to source and sell a desirable and fresh mix of merchandise at attractive prices. We need to continuously source a variety and quantity of merchandise from sought-after brands in a cost-effective manner. Our exclusive, invitation-only membership model creates the opportunity for our suppliers to ensure that their overstock is sold in a discreet and controlled environment, protecting their retail pricing strategies and the desirability of their brands while allowing them to maximize value for their overstock. Our model allows us to clearly distinguish ourselves from other fashion clearance channels such as online shopping clubs, factory outlet centers or other retail wholesalers has made us an attractive and preferred partner and facilitates our early access to high-quality inventory at favorable prices. Developments in the retail fashion industry, combined with the seasonal nature of our suppliers’ industry, may impact the timing of our merchandise procurement and the prices at which we can procure such merchandise. For example, favorable economic conditions in the fashion industry typically lead to increases in production volumes by our suppliers and, consequently, may result in greater availability of overstock merchandise in the market and an opportunity to source such excess overstock merchandise at better prices. In contrast, extended periods of financial uncertainty or decreases in consumer spending may cause our suppliers to reduce their production, thereby limiting the amount of merchandise on the market and negatively affecting the prices at which we can purchase overstock merchandise. Sufficient availability of overstock in the market can be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions, changes to the distribution plans of our brand partners or an overall decline in the fashion market. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has and will potentially continue to have a wide range of supply chain implications, including increases in cost and disruption in freight transport. Similarly, the lockdowns and the temporary port closures in China due to the COVID-19 pandemic have and will potentially continue to lead to lower availability of overstock because merchandise is not able to be produced or is stuck in transit. See “Risk _Factors—_ _Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business depends on our ability to continuously source and present a variety and quantity of attractive products from various popular brands at attractive prices that will satisfy our customers’ preferences and demands.”_ In addition, weather conditions can impact the timing and availability of merchandise. A mild autumn or a cold spring may negatively impact the sale of winter and summer merchandise, respectively, by our suppliers. This may lead to the earlier availability of merchandise but may also result in our need to lower prices to follow price reductions by our suppliers online and in their high street retail locations. We have the ability to purchase large quantities of merchandise, including mixed lots, which are lots that do not contain a typical distribution of sizes and colors, increasing our value as counterparty to our suppliers. As a result, we are often the first choice of our suppliers, reinforcing our customer proposition by giving us preferential access to desirable merchandise. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cost of sales was 53.1% of our revenue, due to measured price reductions to support sales during market uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, a lower spring/summer merchandise level and a late onset of fall/winter season at the end of the three months ended September 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cost of sales was higher, at 54.4% of our revenue, due to the improved customer proposition with a larger and more attractive merchandise offering. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, cost of sales was at 57.0% of our revenue, due to overall market conditions and business growth as well as a shift to more premium and luxury brands, inflation, supply chain shortage and low overstock availability.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Some of the various factors which influence our pricing strategy are beyond our control, including market conditions, overstock availability, and demand. For example, inflationary pressure may impact consumer purchasing power while geopolitical uncertainty and price volatility could lead to a decrease in consumer confidence and spending. Pricing of our products more broadly has a direct impact on our revenue and profitability margin. An effective pricing strategy ensures optimal timing and pricing levels for a product as it moves through the different markdown stages, thereby maximizing its revenue and profit contribution. Conversely, if we fail to manage our pricing strategy adequately, we may lose sales and forfeit profitability. An effective markdown strategy improves the quality of our inventory by ensuring efficient stock turnover. Continuous improvements of our pricing strategy and our pricing-related technology, including a machine learning program for automatic pricing, have contributed 80 ----- to our revenue growth from the year ended December 31, 2019 to March 31, 2022 and, we believe, help us to maintain healthy EBITDA margins even in challenging market conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Our “viral engine” model, in which existing customers invite new customers, generates substantial topline growth every year. New viral customers (customers who have been invited by existing customers) are the primary drivers of our year-on-year structural revenue growth and an important driver for our expansion. Our online business has grown at a CAGR of over 22% from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2020. Moreover, the viral engine is highly cost-efficient, with a low single-digit percentage of total revenue being spent annually on viral engine-related expenses (e.g., commission vouchers). To complement our viral engine model, we introduced our new paid customer acquisition strategy during the second quarter of 2021. Our paid marketing efforts allow us to invite potential new members to join our closed membership model so that they can drive viral growth by using their invitation rights to invite new members, accelerating our viral engine. Our paid marketing efforts are targeted towards specific customer demographics and regions to drive our non-viral growth, especially in areas with currently low penetration (such as Northern Germany and international markets). This “seeding” strategy is very effective with a highly favorable marketing efficiency ratio (defined as incremental revenue generated from our paid marketing strategy divided by marketing spend) and has maintained short payback periods while scaling marketing investment. As a result of our paid marketing strategy, which has included a 2.0x increased marketing spend as a percentage of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, we experienced a significant increase in the number of total new customers in the year ended December 31, 2021. The customer base we gain from our paid marketing strategy is supported by subsequent viral growth in the customer base, resulting in strong marketing efficiency with €6.40 in incremental revenue per €1.00 in marketing spend in the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Our Business—Marketing—Paid customer acquisition.” Our efficient marketing efforts allow us to scale our marketing significantly and maintain short payback periods: (1) Payback period as period after first order of a new customer when CAC equals LTV. LTV (lifetime value) defined as cumulative PCII per customer since first order. PCII defined as gross profit minus fulfillment, payment and customer care costs. CAC (customer acquisition costs) defined as total marketing expenses divided by total number of new customers. The expenses we incur for our viral customer growth model, such as commission vouchers earned by customers for successfully inviting other members, are reflected as sales deductions within revenue. The expenses of marketing activities, including our paid customer acquisition strategy, are included in our selling and distribution expenses. In the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, we incurred marketing expenses of €10.8 million, €9.4 million and €49.0 million, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We offer different payment methods tailored to meet our members’ payment preferences, both in our offline retail stores and our online platform, including credit cards, PayPal, direct debit, instant bank transfer and pay-by-invoice 81 ----- (“buy-now-pay-later”). We are also focusing on making more local payments methods available to our customers. Furthermore, we tailor our payment solutions by customer type and offer certain payment options, such as pay-by-invoice, only to customers who have a sufficient purchase history with us. Customers’ choices of payment method can have a significant effect on our profitability. For example, revenue can vary by up to 2% based on the payment methods available in Germany. In addition, certain payment options can have better order economics than others, for example through lower return rates. On an ongoing basis, we plan to invest more into understanding the effects of payment options and encouraging our customers to choose certain payment options over others.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.2.6,Fulfillment,"Our fulfillment expenses, which are included in the selling and distribution expenses, comprise, among others, content creation, warehousing, handling and packaging, shipping costs, payment costs, customer service and return costs. Our fulfillment expenses are driven by a number of factors, in particular the revenue share of our online operations, the share of international shipping, the effectiveness of our fulfillment centers, capacity utilization, as well as shipping and last-mile delivery costs for third-party carriers who handle the delivery of our products. We primarily incur fulfillment expenses when we ship online orders from our fulfillment center. In the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, we incurred fulfillment expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) of €88.3 million (15.5% of our revenue), €104.4 million (17.0% of our revenue) and €162.3 million (17.2% of our revenue), respectively. The movement in our fulfillment expenses ratio (the ratio of fulfillment expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) to revenue) in these periods was driven by the accelerated shift in our business towards online retail. Offline retail has a much lower fulfillment expenses ratio than online and, consequently, the decrease in the revenue share of our offline retail business has resulted in this structural increase in our fulfillment expenses ratio. Similarly, our shipping costs have increased as a result of the growing share of our international business. This increase in fulfillment expenses has been offset by positive impacts on our fulfillment expenses ratio from pandemic-related lower return rates in the year ended December 31, 2020, and for the first six months of 2021, as well as increased shipping efficiencies. We expect growth in our business to lead to an increase in the complexity of our logistics and, as a result, higher fulfillment expenses. For example, we expect an increase in our shipping costs per item as a result of the growing international share of our business. We also expect an increase in fulfillment center costs due to continued reliance on interim storage solutions first implemented during the six months ended December 31, 2021, and ramp-up effects of our second fulfillment center in Poland, which we expect to enter preliminary stages of operation in 2023. We aim to partially offset these increases with targeted higher sales and the associated higher distribution volume of our products, optimized fulfillment expenses per item from economies of scale, and volume discounts despite price increases by some of our last-mile carriers. We expect that, combined with increased automation as well as process optimization, the resulting offsetting effect will decrease our fulfillment expenses base per item. Orders placed through our marketplace model, in which third-party brands sell their products through our platform, are mainly fulfilled by third-party sellers. As we scale our marketplace offering, we expect to grow our profitability margin as we receive revenue from marketplace sales while our fulfillment expenses with respect to those sales remain flat.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Our business depends significantly on our ability to process transactions on secure information systems and to store, retrieve, process and manage information. In the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, we invested €13.4 million, €10.5 million and €24.2 million, respectively, and in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we invested € 4.4 million and € 7.3 million, respectively, in technology-related capital expenditures to strengthen our technological capabilities and in-house excellence. Our primary front-office technology systems are used to market products to end customers, to manage, track and deliver orders, and to monitor stock and interface with suppliers and other business relations. We have invested significantly in the overall user-experience of our customer-facing systems, as well as in marketing and analytics capabilities to boost customer acquisition, increase sales conversion, and manage churn. We updated our online 82 ----- platform to support multiple currencies and to be available in multiple languages. We also expanded the platform’s payment capabilities to provide better and more flexible options for different customer needs. In addition, we made investments in the scalability of the technology architecture across systems and processes, to support future growth of the business and to manage orders more efficiently. We are also investing in a revamp of our technology systems. We operate a modern fulfillment center in Poing, Germany, near Munich. By investing €15.6 million and €21.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively, the facility was expanded by approximately 60% to support our growing business. The extended site now has a footprint of 48,000 square meters and can hold up to 15 million items of inventory. The site also features multi-channel processes and supplies our retail stores. We are in the process of launching our second fulfillment center in Poland, which we expect to enter preliminary stages of operation in 2023.

A number of factors influence our return rates, such as products not matching their online description, issues with product quality, unexpected variations in sizes, or wrong items being shipped. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic also lowered our return rates, with a (temporary) shift in consumer focus to categories with structurally lower return rates, such as casual wear or kids clothing. Return rates also marginally decreased likely due to customers being less comfortable leaving their homes to return items. With the easing of pandemic-related restrictions and customers growing accustomed to changed circumstances, return rates have trended back towards pre-pandemic levels. We continuously seek to optimize our return rates and minimize the costs associated with our free return policy by focusing on the accuracy of our product descriptions, including size recommendations, and improving the visualizations of our products on our apps and websites, avoiding returns where possible. For example, we are developing technology which will enable us to further improve size recommendations. Furthermore, we focus on providing an efficient and reliable fulfillment process to make sure the right items are shipped and arrive in a timely fashion. In accordance with IFRS, we use our historical return rates to anticipate future returns and to deduct such anticipated returns from our revenue and cost of materials. If actual return rates turn out to be higher, we lose the corresponding share of revenue and profits. Approximately 99% of the products returned are recorded as inventory and are available for sale again having undergone a quality assessment to ensure the return products are in good order.

Our unique proposition provides us with the opportunity to continuously capture market share and participate in the structural growth momentum of our market. Our strategy for expansion into new international markets and to increase penetration in our existing markets is to: (1) identify and prioritize future growth markets, (2) localize our offering for specific markets, (3) use performance marketing campaigns to establish a customer base, and (4) achieve a viral status which in turn yields cyclical growth. We have diversified our geographic revenue streams, with the proportion of our revenue derived from our International segment steadily increasing, and amounting to 18.7%, 22.7% and 28.4% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and 25.7% and 32.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Our International segment revenue experienced a CAGR of 58% between the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2021, compared to a CAGR of 21% in our Germany segment revenue for the same period.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.2.10,Marketplace,"In addition to our core wholesale model through which we sell our own inventory of branded fashion merchandise at attractive discounts, we introduced a new marketplace model in the year ended December 31, 2021. Through our marketplace model, we offer third-party fashion brands the option to market their products on our BestSecret online platform without holding these products in our own inventory. We expect to achieve full scale operation of our marketplace model in the second half of 2022. We have already gained significant traction with our marketplace offering, with customers placing an increasing number of orders on a monthly basis since its inception. The new marketplace is one of the core pillars of our growth strategy. Our marketplace model has helped us expand into the market for discounted in-season and end-of-season fashion and we are well-positioned to provide our customers with a wider product assortment, which we expect to drive incremental revenue. We also expect the additional products to be from affordable luxury or luxury brands, who tend to prefer marketplace models that give them more control over merchandise presentation and prices. The expanded product selection could potentially contribute to an increase in order size and a reduction in the likelihood of products being out of stock, as we attract more sellers who hold their own stock in existing product categories. We believe that these features will further support our position as the go-to destination for online off-price fashion, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Furthermore, we anticipate that the marketplace model will increase our profitability through commissions and marketing fees with attractive economics, while having limited inventory and working capital impact. We expect warehousing and fulfillment will typically remain in the hands of third-party suppliers. Our marketplace suppliers are also able to rely on us for fulfillment at their option, which will allow us to benefit from incremental commissions on third-party sales.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.2.11,Seasonality,"Our business is seasonal, which is typical for retailers in the fashion industry. For example, we typically experience an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of the year due to several special sales events (e.g., Black Friday sale, Cyber Week sale and the Christmas shopping season). In the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue in the fourth quarter accounted for 34.2% of our total revenue for the year. In the three months ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, we experienced exceptional revenue growth due to the structural shift towards online shopping due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the fashion market reaches an equilibrium between the online and offline sectors, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to grow at a slower rate. As a result of our seasonality of sales, any factors that harm our operating results during the fourth quarter of a year, including unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic affecting consumer spending levels or inclement weather that deters customers from buying online or visiting our stores, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the full year. Our growth rate fluctuates from quarter to quarter, and we expect that it will continue to do so because of a variety of factors, including the timing and success of our international marketing activities, the share of sales driven by promotional activities, the launch of new categories and product types, seasonality and economic cycles that influence retail apparel purchase trends. Furthermore, our pricing is influenced by the seasonality of our industry and the impact of weather patterns and conditions. For example, if a fall/winter season is unusually warm, we may fail to sell some of the merchandise for the season, resulting in pricing pressure on the same merchandise in the following fall/winter season. 84 ----- In addition, our Operating Net Working Capital is affected by seasonal trading patterns. Our Operating Net Working Capital typically reaches a peak from June to September, with a minimum position in January after the Christmas season has passed.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

We present the expected returns of goods on a gross basis and reduce revenue by the full number of sales that are estimated to be returned. The sale of goods that is recorded in full upon delivery of the goods is then corrected by the estimated number of returns. Commission vouchers earned by customers for successfully inviting other members represent a payment to customers and therefore a revenue reduction when redeemed by the customer.

The increase was primarily driven by continued strong online customer growth, achieved both via the referral based viral increase and paid customer acquisition. This favorable development was complemented by strong order economics and an improved customer proposition including a more attractive brand portfolio, more convenient payment solutions and faster delivery times. Our strong revenue growth was driven by growth in both our Germany and International segments, an expansion of our customer base from 2020, continued high customer loyalty resulting in an outstanding revenue retention, and strong order economics. Our revenue growth was slightly offset by revenue declines in our offline retail stores due to the government-imposed COVID-19-related temporary store closures in Germany and Austria during 2021. _Cost of sales_ Our cost of sales increased by €185.5 million, or 56.7%, from €327.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €512.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 corresponding to 54.4% (2020: 53.1%) of revenue. This development is attributable to and in line with the strong business growth and the improved customer proposition with a larger and more attractive merchandise offering. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets of €1.5 million (2020: €0.9 million) and personnel expenses of €6.0 million (2020: €3.8 million) are reported in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Selling and distribution expenses_ Our selling and distribution expenses increased by €62.3 million, or 24.3%, from €256.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €318.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher business volumes, resulting in higher fulfillment expenses such as shipping costs and personnel expenses in logistics. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 33.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our selling and distribution expenses consisted of fulfillment expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) of €162.3 million (2020: €104.4 million), marketing expenses of €49.0 million (2020: €9.4 million), sales expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) of €28.9 million (2020: €27.5 million) and amortization, depreciation and impairment expenses of €78.6 million (2020: €115.2 million). The fulfilment expenses increased by €57.9 million which was mainly due to higher business volume resulting in higher shipping costs and higher personnel costs in logistics. As a result, the fulfillment expenses ratio (the ratio of fulfillment expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) to revenue) came to 17.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020: 17.0%). In the year ended December 31, 2021, marketing expenses equaled 5.2% (2020: 1.5%) of revenue. This increase in marketing expenses was mainly due to investments in paid customer acquisition through targeted online marketing campaigns. Sales expenses increased to €28.9 million (2020: €27.5 million) due to higher costs for payment service providers. Personnel expenses for the stores decreased by €3.5 million to €11.5 million (2020: €15.0 million) which was partly attributable to receipt of government grants for short-term workers in our stores in Germany and Austria during COVID-19. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets as well as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, amortization and impairment of purchase price allocation assets decreased to €78.6 million (2020: €115.2 million), and primarily comprised amortization of brand names and customer base of €58.7 million (2020: €47.5 million). The decrease was mainly due to impairment losses on goodwill in the amount of €50.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, related to our stationary retail stores due to the accelerated shift towards online shopping caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 88 ----- _Administrative expenses_ Our administrative expenses increased by €17.9 million, or 29.2%, from €61.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel and technology expenses as well as costs relating to COVID-19, including health and safety measures. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our administrative expenses consisted of technology expenses of €21.3 million (2020: €12.3 million), general and administrative expenses of €51.7 million (2020: €41.1 million) and depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets as well as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of €6.1 million (2020: €7.8 million). The increase in technology expenses by €9.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs as well as higher costs for IT licenses and maintenance. Compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, the general and administrative expenses increased by €10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher personnel and recruiting costs. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets as well as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets decreased by €1.7 million since the year ended December 31, 2020 contained impairment losses on software no longer used in the amount of €2.8 million. _Other operating income_ Our other operating income increased by €0.2 million, or 7.7%, from €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and to €2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other operating income mainly comprises income from exchange rate gains and compensation for damages. _Other operating expenses_ Our other operating expenses increased by €0.8 million, or 28.6%, from €2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to foreign exchange rate losses. _Financial income_ Our financial income decreased by €0.2 million from €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to nil for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Financial expenses_ Our financial expenses increased by €0.3 million, or 1.2%, from €25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher interest expenses in connection with lease accounting under IFRS 16. Financial expenses mainly consist of interest on the Existing Notes and lease liabilities under IFRS 16. _Income taxes_ Our income taxes changed by €2.6 million from €1.0 million tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €1.6 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher taxable income as a result of increasing business volumes. _Net income/(net loss) for the period_ Our net loss for the period amounted to €53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the net income of €3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of €57.6 million.

Revenue growth was driven by the structural shift towards online shopping due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased online business was offset by a decrease in revenue from offline (brick-and-mortar) business at our premium stores and our outlet stores of 33% mainly due to the government-imposed COVID-19-related temporary store closures in spring and winter 2020. _Cost of sales_ Our cost of sales increased by €31.1 million, or 10.5%, from €296.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €327.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to overall business growth and to targeted online marketing campaigns following the outbreak of COVID-19. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue were 53.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 51.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to our targeted online campaigns in spring 2020 that used discounts and vouchers with the deliberate aim of maintaining top-line growth and generating cash, a lower spring/summer merchandise level due to a customer shift to prudent buying during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a late onset of fall/winter season in the year ended December 31, 2020. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets of €0.9 million (2019: €1.0 million) and personnel expenses of €3.8 million (2019: €3.1 million) are reported in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. _Selling and distribution expenses_ Our selling and distribution expenses increased by €63.1 million, or 32.6%, from €193.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to €256.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to impairment losses on goodwill, higher business volume resulting in higher shipping and payment service provider costs as well as an increase in health and safety measures, such as the introduction of a third shift in our fulfillment center. For the reasons described above, selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 33.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 41.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our selling and distribution expenses consisted of fulfillment expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) of €104.4 million (2019: €88.3 million), marketing expenses of €9.4 million (2019: €10.8 million), sales expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) of €27.5 million (2019: €33.0 million) and amortization, depreciation and impairment expenses of €115.2 million (2019: €61.3 million). The fulfilment expenses increased by €16.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 which was mainly due to higher business volume resulting in higher shipping costs as well as health and safety measures, such as the introduction of a third shift in our fulfillment center. As a result, the fulfillment expenses ratio (the ratio of fulfillment expenses (excluding amortization and depreciation expenses) to revenue) came to 17.0% in the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019: 15.5%). In the year ended December 31, 2020, marketing expenses equaled 1.5% (2019: 1.9%) of our revenue. The decrease in marketing expenses was mainly due to a range of cost-cutting measures. Compared to 90 ----- the year ended December 31, 2019, sales expenses decreased by €5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease of personnel expenses for the stores in the amount of €6.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to receipt of government grants for short-term workers in our stores in Germany and Austria during COVID-19. This effect was partly offset by an increase of payment costs in the amount of €1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher business volume. In the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets as well as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, amortization and impairment of purchase price allocation assets increased to €115.2 million (2019: €61.3 million), and primarily comprised impairment of goodwill in the amount of €50.8 million (2019: nil) and amortization of brand names and customer base of €47.5 million (2019: €47.5 million). The impairment losses on goodwill related to our stationary retail stores due to the accelerated shift towards online shopping caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. _Administrative expenses_ Our administrative expenses increased by €9.6 million, or 18.6%, from €51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €61.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel expenses, costs incurred for IT licenses and maintenance, costs relating to COVID-19 and health and safety as well as higher consultancy fees. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our administrative expenses consist of technology expenses of €12.3 million (2019: €10.4 million), general and administrative expenses of €41.1 million (2019: €37.1 million) and depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets of €7.8 million (2019: €4.1 million). For the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses contain impairment losses of €2.8 million on software no longer used. _Other operating income_ Our other operating income increased by €1.1 million, or 73.3%, from €1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly attributable to COVID-19-related revenue compensation in Austria, and income from exchange rate gains. _Other operating expenses_ Our other operating expenses decreased by €0.7 million from €3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower credit losses. _Financial income_ Our financial income increased by €0.2 million from nil for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to interest received on tax refunds. _Financial expenses_ Our financial expenses increased by €1.6 million, or 6.6%, from €24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Financial expenses mainly consist of interest on the Existing Notes and lease liabilities under IFRS 16. _Income taxes_ Our income taxes changed by €1.2 million from €0.2 million tax expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1.0 million tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020. This development is primarily due to increased release of deferred tax liabilities in connection with a shortening of the useful life for the customer base of “Schustermann & Borenstein” as a result of our rebranding, as well as changes in the valuation of goods. _Net income/(net loss) for the year_ Our loss for the period amounted to €53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the net income of €3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of €57.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the amount of €50.8 million (2019: nil) related to our offline retail stores due to the accelerated shift towards online shopping caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic. One-time expenses in connection with COVID-19, restructuring measures, as well as a lower gross margin, also contributed to the decline in earnings. 91 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The increase in Germany revenue was primarily driven by strong online performance, offset by the significant decrease in revenue in our offline retail stores due to government-imposed, COVID-19-related temporary closures. Our online revenue in Germany increased by €221.2 million, or 54.4%, from €406.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €628.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The increase in International Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to further international expansion and the expanded customer base. International Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 2.8% points from 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of increased paid customer acquisition activities. See “Internationalization––Results of Operations.” International Adjusted EBITDA increased by €5.0 million from €11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in International Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to further international expansion and the expanded customer base. The costs incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic by the offline retail business as well as the revenue compensation in Austria are part of the adjustments included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, so did not impact our Adjusted EBITDA results. International Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 1.0% points from 10.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of lower marketing expenses and scaling effects in overhead expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Our business model is focused on ensuring adequate liquidity to allow for flexibility with regard to the purchase of merchandise, including opportunistic mixed lot purchases. Given our positive liquidity situation, we are able to procure merchandise through our operating cash generation, providing us with flexibility which we believe particularly appeals to our suppliers. Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Although we believe that our expected net cash flows from operating activities, together with the borrowings that will be available under the Notes and New Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient net cash flows from operating activities or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

For more information see Note 2.4 of the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. 95 ----- _Net cash flows from operating activities_ Our net cash flows from operating activities changed by €52.3 million from net cash inflows of €8.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to net cash outflows of €44.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was mainly affected by a decrease of refund liabilities and trade and other payables due to a seasonal stock purchasing pattern and increased business volume for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our net cash flows from operating activities decreased by €6.7 million from net cash inflows of €95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to net cash inflows of €89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in inventory held due to strong business growth and a reversal of the strict cash management policy for the procurement of goods that was in place during 2020. Our net cash flows from operating activities increased by €12.6 million from net cash inflows of €83.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to net cash inflows of €95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net cash flows from operating activities were positively affected by a strong year-end business resulting in positive cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. _Net cash flows from investing activities_ Our net cash flows from investing activities decreased by €4.7 million from net cash outflows of €4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to net cash outflows of €9.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash outflows from investments in development IT. Our net cash flows from investing activities increased by €5.6 million from net cash outflows of €33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to net cash outflows of €28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net cash outflows from investing activities was primarily due to investment in the expansion of our fulfillment center in the year ended December 31, 2020, which was partly offset by an increase in development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our net cash flows from investing activities decreased by €2.8 million from net cash outflows of €36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to net cash outflows of €33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net cash outflows for investing activities were mainly for the expansion of our fulfillment center, investments in IT and other technology to advance our user experience, the upgrade of our technology infrastructure, as well as project support at the fulfillment center, while all other capital expenditure was successfully scaled back due to the uncertainties of the pandemic. _Net cash flows from financing activities_ Our net cash flows from financing activities decreased by €0.9 million from net cash outflows of €3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to net cash outflows of €4.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The net cash flows from financing activities were impacted by higher payments for leases in the year ended December 31, 2021. Our net cash flows from financing activities decreased by €1.3 million from net cash outflows of €29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to net cash outflows of €30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net cash outflows from financing activities was primarily due to increase of payments in connection with lease liabilities. Our net cash flows from financing activities decreased by €1.5 million from net cash outflows of €27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to net cash outflows of €29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our Capital Expenditure decreased by €5.3 million, from €34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to lower levels of investment activity relating to the fulfillment center expansion. Our Capital Expenditure decreased by €2.7 million, from €36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is attributable to carefully managed capital expenditure during the COVID-19 crisis with expansion of our logistics center as our main growth project while other areas of capital expenditure were scaled back. Our budgeted Capital Expenditure for the year ending December 31, 2022 is expected to be significantly higher than in the previous years due to investments into our technology and fulfillment center infrastructure to support our business growth, which we expect to finance through the incurrence of additional indebtedness.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.40,Significant Accounting Policies,17.40.1,Use of estimates and assumptions,"The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that have effects on the amounts carried and the related disclosures. Although these estimates are based on the current events and measures to the best of management’s knowledge, there may be deviations between estimated and actual results. Significant estimates and assumptions have been used for the following matters in particular: - Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID-19 impact) - Determination and assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes - The determination of provisions for restoration expenses and other provisions - Assumptions for the calculation of returns and unredeemed coupons - Inventory valuation - Segment reporting - Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables - Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 - Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16 - Assumptions with regard to useful life of our customer base due to the structural shift towards e-commerce These key forward-looking assumptions and estimates, which involve a significant risk of changing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year, are discussed below. _Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID-19 impact)_ All non-financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are tested for impairment if there are indicators that the asset may be impaired. Regardless of indicators of impairment, goodwill acquired in business combinations is tested for impairment once a year at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 100 ----- This assessment implies significant judgment and estimates, in particular in light of the uncertainties in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the shift to the online market business in general, and this was taken into account in the impairment testing for goodwill and the review of useful lives for the intangible assets recognized using the purchase method in compliance with IFRS 3. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. This is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model that is the basis for the calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal used as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant to goodwill. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in Note 5.1 of the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements / Note 5.2 of the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. _Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes_ Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for prior years. Various factors such as past experience with tax field audits and different treatment of tax regulations by tax authorities are considered. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profit. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainty. Consequently, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets recognized at the reporting date. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the income statement. _Determination of provisions for restorations expenses and other provisions_ The determination of provisions for restoration expenses requires assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rates, expected costs and timing of these costs. If the interest effect resulting from the discounting is significant, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. Provisions mainly comprise provisions for restoration expenses and provisions for restructuring. Whether a present obligation is probable or not requires judgment. The nature and type of risks for these provisions differ, and management’s judgment is applied regarding the nature and extent of obligations in deciding if an outflow of resources is probable or not. As of December 31, 2021, long-term provisions were discounted at an interest rate of 7.5%. In the case of discounting, timing-related interest effects are recognized as financial expenses. _Calculation of returns and unredeemed gift vouchers Returns_ For transactions with a statutory 14-day or longer refund policy, we calculate the amount of the expected returns as of the reporting date based on historical return rates under consideration of the actual returns until the date of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are taken into account in order to reduce revenue. As of December 31, 2021, deferred sales recognized as refund liability amounted to €39.7 million compared to €19.6 million as of March 31, 2022. The right to recover possession of expected returns is reported under other current non-financial assets. _Unredeemed gift vouchers_ The acquiring customer has a claim from the sale of vouchers for fulfillment up to a period of three years. If vouchers sold are not redeemed within this period, we realize the revenue from the voucher sale. Liabilities from the sale of gift vouchers are recognized under other liabilities and amounted as of December 31, 2021, to €2.0 million compared to €1.7 million as of March 31, 2022. 101 ----- _Inventory valuation_ Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary costs to make the sale. Estimates are necessary to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. _Segment reporting_ IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the respective segments. Before the year ended December 31, 2021, we have reported in two segments: “Online” and “Stationary retail business”. In recent years, we have been able to leverage the accelerated structural shift to e-commerce and set a clear focus on online business. This transition has resulted in a change in the internal organizational setup, the management structure, and the internal reporting lines. As the internal organizational and management structure and the internal reports submitted to the CODM form the basis for determining our segment reporting format, we have therefore realigned our segment reporting. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and thereafter, our segments will be “Germany” and “International”. Primary emphasis is placed on the key performance indicators revenue and adjusted EBITDA. _Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables_ The determination of the necessity and amount of valuation allowances on receivables requires assumptions and estimates regarding the credit risk and underlying time intervals. In the case of a return debit, we inform the customer and defines a period for payment. When the defined time period has elapsed, written warnings are sent to the customers. We use a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due and our historical default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on expectations as to the collectability of the receivables. _Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16_ The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering our debt structure and the useful life of the leased assets. To measure lease liabilities, we use the incremental borrowing rate. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate by using observable input factors. _Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16_ The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering the overall business development as well as the term of existing leases. _Assumptions with regard to useful life of the Group’s customer base_ The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the structural shift towards e-commerce. Our testing of the useful lives of the Group’s customer base at the end of 2020 resulted in the for prospective adjustment of the remaining useful life of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base from 10 years to 5 years starting in the 2021 reporting period onwards. This change in estimate of useful life has resulted in an increase of the annual amortization of €6.6 million.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, we elect whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses. When we acquire a business, we assess the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 102 ----- Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of our cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. In case of any structural changes of the respective cashgenerating units within the Group, an impairment review and potential reallocation of the goodwill according to IAS 36 is performed. As of March 31, 2022, our goodwill amounted to €203.5 million. No impairment was recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Assets and liabilities measured or presented at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements are classified on the basis of the following fair value hierarchy. The classification uses the input parameters of the lowest category that is material to the fair value measurement. - Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities - Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly - Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the assets and liabilities",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Revenue is reported net of discounts, rebates, taxes and returns. Since we have price discretion in our sales transactions and also bear the inventory and credit risk, we generally act as a principal and are therefore the principal party of all sales transactions. In addition, we purchase some products such as jewelry on a commission basis. In this case, we are acting as an agent, but are free in the setting of prices. Revenue is recognized net of commissions earned. Revenue recognition requires the fulfillment of the following recognition criteria: _Sale of goods and products_ Our contracts with customers for the sale of merchandise generally include a single performance obligation. We have concluded that revenue from the sale of merchandise should be recognized at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. In the stationary retail business, revenue is therefore recognized upon handing over the goods and in online trading upon delivery of the goods to the customer. _Accounting treatment of returns in the online business_ Under IFRS 15, the consideration received from the customer is variable because the contract allows the customer to return the products. We use the expected value method to estimate the merchandise that will be returned because this method predicts most accurately the amount of variable consideration to which we will be entitled. We apply the requirements in IFRS 15 on constraining estimates of variable consideration such as return rate to determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. We present a refund liability (other current financial liabilities) and an asset (other current non-financial assets) for the right to recover possession of goods from a customer separately in the statement of financial position, taking into account the costs incurred for processing the return and the losses resulting from disposing of these goods. We present the expected returns of goods on a gross basis in the statement of comprehensive income and reduce revenue by the full amount of sales that we estimate to be returned. The dispatch of goods that is recorded in full when they are shipped is 103 ----- then corrected by the estimated value of the returns. Generally, we allow goods to be returned within a period of 14 days of receipt. Longer periods may be agreed upon contractually. _Friends recommend friends – loyalty program_ We maintain a recommendation program for customers. Every time the invitee (recommended customer) places an order, the inviting customer (inviter) receives a one-time commission voucher of 10% to 20% (2020: 10%). The inviter also receives a 5% to 7% (2020: 5%) voucher based on the total purchases of the invitee within a period of 12 months. According to IFRS 15, both vouchers represent a payment to customers and therefore a revenue reduction when redeemed by the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.40,Significant Accounting Policies,17.40.5,Taxes,"_Current income taxes_ Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. For the purpose of measuring current German taxes, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15% is applied to distributed and retained earnings and a solidarity surcharge rate of 5.5% is applied to that amount. That yields a tax rate of 15.825%. In addition, German trade tax is imposed on profits earned in Germany. The trade tax is based on the assessment rates of the various municipalities and the basic federal rate, which has been a flat rate of 3.5% according to Sec. 11 (2) GewStG (Gewerbesteuergesetz: German Trade Tax Act) since the corporate tax reform in 2008. The trade tax varies depending on the different assessment rates of the municipalities, but a flat rate of 11.41% for the year ended December 31, 2021, 11.62% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 11.70% for the year ended December 31, 2019 is applied in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The profits earned by the non-German Group companies are calculated on the basis of the national tax laws applicable in each country and taxed at the tax rates in effect in those countries. The country-specific tax rates range from 21 to 25%. Our tax rate is 27.23%. Current tax expenses are calculated on the basis of the taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs from the net income/profit presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a result of the expenses and income that will not be taxable or that becomes tax-exempt in later years. Our liability for current taxes is calculated on the basis of the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted in the near future. _Deferred taxes_ Deferred taxes are provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except: - Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and - In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except: - Where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the pre-tax accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and - In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the 104 ----- temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the end of the reporting period. Deferred income tax relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and not in the profit or loss. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in profit or loss. As of March 31, 2022, deferred tax liabilities amounted to €74.1 million (compared to €76.3 million as of December 31, 2021) and mainly belongs to the acquired intangible assets in connection with the purchase price allocation (trademark and customer relationship) and the valuation of inventories. The deferred tax liabilities decreased due to the amortization of the PPA assets. _Value added tax_ Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of value added tax (“VAT”) except: - If VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case VAT is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of expense item as applicable; and - Where receivables, payables and finance lease liabilities are stated with the amount of VAT included. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

This includes customer bases and brand names. These are recognized as an intangible asset according to IAS 38, measured at fair value and amortized over their expected useful lives. An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized. Intangible assets which are not acquired as part of a business combination but as purchased licenses are initially recognized at cost. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful life. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indications of impairment at the reporting date. The remaining useful life and the amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of a reporting period. If the reasons for impairment have been 105 ----- eliminated, a reversal to a maximum of the historical cost is set as the upper limit. Required changes in the amortization period and method are treated as changes in estimates. Impairment losses on intangible assets, e.g., customer base and brand names, with finite useful lives are included in amortization within selling expenses. As of March 31, 2022, intangible assets (mainly customer relationships and trademarks) amounted to €275.0 million. The main intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and pro rata temporis over their customary useful lives: the brands Schustermann & Borenstein (useful life: 5 years) and BestSecret (useful life: 20 years) and the Schustermann & Borenstein customer base (useful life: 8 years) and BestSecret customer base (useful life: 8 years). Other intangible assets (software and licenses) are recognized at acquisition cost less amortization charged pro _rata temporis using the straight-line method (useful life of between 3 and 8 years)._ Due to the rebranding of the Group in 2019, the total useful life for the brand name Schustermann & Borenstein was reduced from 30 years to 5 years as of January 1, 2019. At the same time, the total useful life of the customer base Schustermann & Borenstein was reduced from 20 years to 14 years. Reviewing the useful lives at the end of 2021 showed the need for prospective alignment of the remaining useful life of the respective customer bases to 3 years from the 2022 reporting period onwards. This reduces the total useful life for the Schustermann & Borenstein customer base accordingly to 8 years. In the case of internally generated intangible assets, IAS 38 makes a distinction between the research phase and the development phase. Costs incurred during the research phase cannot be capitalized; instead they must be recognized as an expense. On the other hand, costs incurred during the development phase must be capitalized, _provided that the reporting entity demonstrably fulfills all six criteria set out in IAS 38.57 et seq. The Group_ primarily develops key components of software (Best Secret website and the Best Secret app as well as expenses for the Group’s other IT-systems and infrastructure) used by the Group.

The Group treats changes in the residual values or useful lives that arise during use as a change in estimates. Depreciation is charged over the following useful lives: 6–20 years for leasehold improvements, 5–14 years for plant and machinery and 5–23 years for furniture and fixtures. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognized. The residual values, useful lives, and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. If the carrying amount of a tangible asset exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized, in addition to systematic depreciation, in order to lower the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (net selling price) and the present value of the net cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset. Whenever possible, the net selling price is derived from the most recently observed market transactions.

Cost is calculated on the basis of an item-by-item measurement, factoring in the additions from the point of view of the sourcing market or on the basis of the moving average price of the goods. Incidental acquisition costs are generally measured on a monthly basis. Supplier payments that are to be classified as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of inventories. Consumption of inventories is recognized within the costs of sales in the statement of comprehensive income. 106 ----- Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The net realizable value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. Adequate write-downs to net realizable value were made to allow for all risks from slow-moving goods and/or reduced salability. When the circumstances that previously caused merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist, the write-down is reversed. Our inventories as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 were €160.2 million, €155.7 million and €232.9 million, respectively, and €248.2 million as of March 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The prior year figures as of December 31, 2019 and as of December 31, 2020 included in the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted accordingly. The cash in transit balances are presented as cash equivalents as these balances are immediately credited to the bank account with the payment service providers over which the company has direct power of disposal.

Leases are typically entered into for periods of 2 to 22 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is broken down into an interest component and a principal repayment. Interest is recognized in the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for the reporting period (effective interest method). It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - renewal options - variable lease payments that are based on an index or an (interest) rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee uses the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: 107 ----- - the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date - any initial direct costs, and - restoration costs. Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. _The Group as a lessor_ We sub-lease office and retail space. When we act as a lessor, we determine at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, we make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, we consider certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset. In case of finance leases, rental income is recognized using the effective interest method over the term of the subleases and reported under interest income. Payments received from operating subleases are recognized within other operating income.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Trade receivables are initially recognized at the settlement-date fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is usually the original invoice value less a loss allowance for expected impairment losses. The loss allowance for trade receivables is determined based on lifetime expected credit losses, which are calculated as the present value of expected cash shortfalls. Changes are recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For its online customers, the Group offers the option to purchase on account. In connection with this payment option, the Group works with a factoring provider, transferring substantially all risks and rewards resulting from the receivables to the factoring company and derecognizing receivables in the statement of financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated income statement over the duration of the obligation using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount upon initial recognition. The embedded prepayment option for the Existing Notes is considered to be closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. We define “closely related” up to a 5% difference between amortized cost and redemption price as of the redemption date. Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade and other payables and other liabilities, are measured at amortized cost. Trade and other payables are amounts owed as consideration for goods or services provided to us in the normal course of business including amounts owed to a payment service provider governing the settlement of supplier liabilities. In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are 108 ----- therefore classified as current; otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or nominal value. We derecognize a financial liability when the related obligation has been paid, canceled, or has expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized financial liability written off and the consideration received or due is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

A best estimate is made of the amount of the provisions, taking into consideration all the discernible risks arising from the obligation. This refers to the amount that is most likely needed to settle the liability. Provisions with a residual term of more than one year are discounted on the reporting date. _Provisions for restoration obligations_ The Group recognizes provisions for restoration obligations for leasehold improvements in the leased warehouses and office buildings. The provision is recognized at an amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated future restoration obligations. The restoration obligations are recognized as part of the cost of the leasehold improvements at the corresponding amount. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is commensurate to the maturity and risk profile. The unwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and recognized as an interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income. _Provisions for restructuring measures_ Provisions for restructuring measures are recognized to the extent that decisions by management have been announced in sufficient detail to those affected as of the reporting date.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Competition,18.1.1,,"The market for online off-price fashion is experiencing a consolidation trend, especially in Germany, where the top 5 players are estimated to hold a market share of approximately 47% as of December 2020. There are several structural reasons for this ongoing consolidation trend. Brands are looking to reduce the number of distribution partners they work with to reduce complexity and increase efficiency with respect to their distribution. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend given our ability to clear large quantities of overstock as well as our development of trusted, long-standing relationships with our brand partners. Further, the online channel is becoming increasingly professionalized and is also exposed to large economies of scale, thus providing further support for consolidation of the market. The competitors we face differ between our geographic markets as well as through different business models and product offerings. We compete with other dedicated off-price players, full-price platforms that offer discounted in-season and end-of-season fashion, as well as players within the wider fashion e-commerce landscape. Within the dedicated off-price market, our competitors include ZalandoLounge, Veepee, Brands4Friends, Limango, Dress for Less and Otrium. However, we believe that our business model and proposition is fundamentally different to these players. Many of these players pursue a flash-sale model, whereby the company offers a discount for a short period of time on a limited number of products. We believe this is less appealing for customers as they do not have access to a permanent assortment and often face long delivery times. The competitive landscape within the discounted in-season and end-of-season fashion segment is more fragmented and includes full-price platforms such as Zalando and Mytheresa. We believe that our unique proposition distinctly separates us from the above-mentioned peers, from both a brand and customer perspective. We are the only online off-price player to operate a closed membership model by invitation-only which allows us to offer much greater brand equity protection than our competitors who typically employ mass marketing. We are also able to purchase large quantities of overstock directly from our brand partners and so are well positioned to provide a structural and silent solution for their overstock. From a customer perspective, we offer a permanent assortment, unlike many of our competitors that focus on a flash-sale model. This gives us a strong advantage given the resulting longer delivery times that are associated with flash-sale models, and speed of delivery being a key factor in the customer experience. Our membership model also offers a high degree of exclusivity resulting in a highly loyal and active customer base. We believe we offer an experience that is at least on par with full-price platforms like Zalando, About You or Mytheresa, while offering our customers attractive discounts ranging from 20% to 80% across our standing assortment. 113 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,OUR BUSINESS Overview,18.2.1,,"We are a leading members-only destination for online off-price fashion, operating in the off-price market with a focus on mid-market to luxury fashion in Europe. We provide our customers with exclusive access to a portfolio of around 3,000 brands, while offering our brand partners a structural solution to sell their overstock through a discreet and controlled channel and protecting their brand equity. With a heritage going back nearly 100 years, we have evolved from an offline retail business to a tech-driven online platform. We offer a wide range of midmarket to luxury fashion brands at attractive discounts ranging from 20% to 80%, providing a permanent assortment of approximately 250,000 items at any moment in time. Our online offering is available in multiple languages and in 27 European countries. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €996.3 million, an Adjusted EBITDA of €131.4 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.2%. Our online revenue, which accounted for 91.7% of total revenue in the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, grew at a CAGR of 41.2% from the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 to the twelve months ended March 31, 2022. While 70.1% of our revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 was generated in Germany, our international business outside of Germany continues to gain in importance relative to our Germany business and experienced strong revenue growth of 86.3% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 (with a CAGR of 62.2% from the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 to the twelve months ended March 31, 2022).",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Strengths,18.3.1,Our business operates successfully in a large and resilient market with long-term growth supported by structural tailwinds,"We operate in the European online fashion market (excluding Russia and the United Kingdom) for mid-market to luxury brands, primarily in the dedicated online off-price and discounted in-season and end-of-season sectors. By targeting the online off-price sector, we are well-positioned to take advantage of three structural long-term trends in the fashion sector: (1) disproportional demand growth in the off-price market, expected to grow at 5% per year from 2021-2025, (2) a shift to more premium fashion, with the mid-market to luxury fashion market expected to grow at 4% per year from 2021-2025 and (3) rising online penetration in the European fashion market, expected to grow at 9% per year from 2021-2025 (source: a leading international consultancy firm, Company Analysis). The growing importance of sustainability for consumers and brands makes the off-price sector an increasingly attractive choice for brands, as it allows for overstock, a structural phenomenon in the fashion industry, to be monetized in a sustainable manner, at discounted prices to consumers and thus avoiding the destruction or disposal of such overstock in landfills. Our closed-membership model offers brands the additional value of discreet overstock clearing at scale and we believe it presents a unique business opportunity to build upon the growing importance of sustainability. As a result of the above factors, and as illustrated in the chart below, the online off-price sector amounted to €44 billion in revenue across Europe (excluding the U.K. and Russia) in 2021, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% from 2021 to 2025 (source: a leading international consultancy firm, Company Analysis). 114 ----- (1) All market sizes refer to 2021 and continental Europe, excl.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Strengths,18.3.2,The most powerful flywheel in online fashion,"The “flywheel” that drives our growth and profitability is the result of several strong elements that feed into one another and that accelerate our viral engine. First, we develop strong brand relationships as a result of our closed and discreet model that allows us to “silently” clear our brand partners’ overstock at scale. Second, based on our strong brand relationships we are able to offer our members a current and attractive assortment of highly desirable brands at discounts ranging from 20% to 80%. Third, we believe this in turn, leads to our members preferring to shop with us, as reflected by exceptional customer key performance indicators (“KPIs”). In combination, these three favorable elements lead to a continuous acceleration of our “viral engine” in which existing members make use of their invitation rights to invite their families and friends. As a consequence, the “flywheel” has generated low double-digit top line growth every year, thereby attracting new brand partners and reinforcing relationships with existing brand partners. Our viral engine has contributed to an exponential growth engine as illustrated in the chart below. (1) Online revenue evolution prior to introduction of performance marketing in 2021. Financials from 2017 to 2020 in accordance with IFRS, German GAAP prior to 2017. 2) 2021. Online only. 3) Based on survey results in the DACH region (n = 1,059 respondents). Share of respondents stating “I like BestSecret and I want my friends and family to be able to get to know it, too”. Question: “What is your main motivation to invite family and friends to join BestSecret”. Source: Company To complement our “viral engine”, we introduced our new paid customer acquisition strategy in the second quarter of 2021. Paid marketing efforts allow us to invite potential new members in a targeted manner to join our closed membership model who can then make use of their invitation rights to invite new members, accelerating our viral 115 ----- engine. Paid marketing efforts drive our non-viral growth, especially in areas with currently low penetration (such as international markets). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operation—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—New customer acquisition” and “Our Business— Marketing—Paid customer acquisition.” Our brand partners_ Our exclusive, invitation-only membership model enables brands to discreetly clear large volumes of overstock in a premium environment entirely separate from their full-price channels. Discretion is increasingly important to brands, as overstock potentially threatens brand equity when sold openly, because the high degree of price visibility in online shopping allows customers to view full-price and discounted offerings side-by-side. We recently introduced a marketplace as part of our online platform to provide our brand partners the option to market their products within our ecosystem without us having to hold these products in our own inventory. We believe that the marketplace model will strengthen the relationship with our brand partners as it allows them to increase their direct to customer (or “DTC”) revenue through our online platform while maintaining price control. We offer brand partners to clear their overstock within a closed ecosystem. This also provides our brand partners comfort that their merchandise is not being re-sold through the grey market (i.e., channels that our brand partners have not authorized) or other channels that could harm their brand image. Thus, our discreet model protects their brand equity and fosters our long-term and deep strategic partnerships leading to direct relationships with around 95% of all our brand partners, thereby avoiding intermediaries. Our model has also resulted in high brand partner retention: we have retained all of our top 50 brand partners from 2017 (excluding intermediaries, private label suppliers and suppliers who went out of business). These strong relationships allow us to offer attractive products at desirable prices, which in turn, allow us to provide our brand partners with access to an affluent and loyal customer base. _Our products, prices and services_ Our superior brand proposition in turn leads to our ability to offer highly desirable products at attractive prices to our customers and provide them with a service experience matching that of full-price online platforms. Our brand proposition and the resulting strong relationships ensure that we are able to secure an attractive brand portfolio of around 3,000 brands, comprising approximately 250,000 articles at any given time. Unlike almost all other online platforms in the off-price segment, our offered assortment is broad and available permanently: we do not rely on flash sales campaigns with long delivery times. Furthermore, our customers benefit from a fresh assortment: the majority of our inventory has been listed on our online platform for less than six months. This desirable assortment is complemented by attractive discounts of 20% to 80% on every single article and a fast delivery time of approximately 3 days on average in 2021. Our online platform is accessible to our customers through our highly rated app and website which offers a highend shopping and service experience on par with leading online full-price platforms, resulting in high customer satisfaction and an excellent net promoter score (“NPS”) of approximately 60 at the end of 2021. As the fashion market and its consumers increasingly make sustainability a driver of their purchasing decisions, we expect that they will increasingly turn to us for their fashion needs, as our model allows customers a chance to shop fashion in one of the most sustainable ways by giving them access to overstock and ensuring that every piece of fashion that is produced is worn. _Our customers_ Our desirable products, prices and service in turn attract a customer base that is active, loyal, and earns above average disposable income. Driven by our broad offering and incentivized by our attractive loyalty scheme, our customer base has been growing steadily. Our number of active customers was approximately 1.2 million, 1.5 million and 2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and 2.5 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, representing a CAGR of 38% between 2019 and 2021. Revenue by customer cohort, grouped by year, or customers who joined in a given year, typically stays stable during the first year of membership. For example, online revenue from our active customers from the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 changed in the respective subsequent years to 99% (2019), 96% (2020) and 118% (2021). Our strong revenue retention track record is further illustrated by the following revenue by cohort chart: 116 ----- (1) Revenue retention is defined as online revenue (NMV after returns incl. shipping income, but excluding cut-off effects and commission) of existing customers divided by revenue of previous year. Source: Company. We believe our value proposition caters to a highly attractive customer demographic, especially to affluent consumers, which drives our strong revenue retention rate, that has increased from 100% to 118% in the period between the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2021. Spend in the fashion industry is heavily skewed toward the most affluent consumer demographic: in Germany for instance, 70% of total fashion spending is made by 30% of the consumers (source: a leading international consultancy firm). These affluent consumers spend more than €1,000 per year on fashion. The off-price market is inherently attractive to affluent consumers. These consumers’ spend is approximately 2.5x more than the average consumer on fashion overall, and 2.4x more in premium, 2.7x more in affordable luxury and 2.9x more in luxury, when compared to the market average (source: a leading international consultancy firm). _Viral engine_ Our “viral engine” is a self-reinforcing model in which existing members invite their friends, colleagues or other acquaintances, thus creating multiple new customers. These new members then repeat the cycle, allowing a single original customer to lead to substantial growth over time. New “viral customers” are the primary drivers of our year-on-year structural revenue growth and an important driver for our expansion. Our viral engine resulted in our online business revenue growing at a CAGR of 22% from 2016 to 2020, after which time we introduced our paid customer acquisition strategy in the second quarter of 2021. Moreover, the viral engine is highly cost-efficient, with a low single-digit percentage of total revenue being spent annually to incentivize customers to invite other customers. The overall effect of this viral model is substantial, with four new active customers generated by ten active customers in 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.5,Our History,18.5.1,,"BestSecret draws on a heritage of nearly 100 years in the textile industry. In 1924, Herman Schustermann founded a textile company in Makredwitz, Germany and relocated to Munich in the late 1940s. In the early 1950s, Benno Borenstein established his textile business in Munich. The two companies merged in 1960, and, after the death of Herman Schustermann, a new cooperation was established with Herman’s son, Emil Schustermann, and Benno Borenstein as partners. While Schustermann & Borenstein initially started out as a combination of two textile trading companies with regional customer bases around Munich, ready-to-wear clothes were added to the portfolio over the next decades and the closed membership retail business model was born. Prior to 2007, our business operations were limited to our Schustermann & Borenstein offline retail stores in Munich. In 2007, we launched our BestSecret online platform. In 2011, we made the BestSecret online platform available in the Austrian market, setting the first milestone for our international expansion strategy. Since then, we have continued our online expansion with the launch of our online presence in Sweden (2015), Switzerland (2015), France (2016), The Netherlands (2018) and, most recently, Belgium (2021) and Poland (2022). Today, our multi-language online platform is available across Europe with shipping available to 27 countries. We have continued to maintain a limited physical presence with premium and outlet stores in strategic locations, with such locations designed primarily to support our online platform. In 2012, the BestSecret Group’s founding families sold a majority stake of 61% of the business to Ardian. In 2014, construction commenced on the new centralized fulfillment center in Poing, Germany (near Munich), which became operational in early 2016 and consolidated our then-existing seven warehouses. In 2014, we expanded our offline retail footprint through the opening of a new store in Vienna, Austria. In 2016, we acquired Swiss Online Shopping AG, a leading off-price player in Switzerland, to further expand our online presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (hereafter referred to as the DACH region). In January 2017, funds owned and managed by Permira acquired a majority stake in the Group. In 2019 and 2020, we expanded our fulfillment center in Poing, Germany by approximately 60% to support our business growth. In late 2020, Dr. Moritz Hahn joined us after nine years of experience at Zalando SE where he served as a member of the Executive Committee and held numerous senior positions. He has since built a strong leadership team of ecommerce pioneers with decades of relevant experience across the tech and e-commerce industry, complemented by senior individuals with long-term experience at and in-depth knowledge of the Company. In early 2021, this senior leadership team announced the new vision “to become the number one online destination for off-price fashion in Europe.” The accompanying strategy is focused on online pure-play, profitable growth across Europe. The offline strategy was sharpened to focus on supporting our online value proposition with premium stores designed to elevate our brand image and outlet stores to clear inventory that fails to sell online.

We also offer fresh merchandise, with the majority of our articles younger than six months. - We ensure a high-end seamless shopping experience for our customers – on par with leading online full-price platforms. - We provide a highly integrated, user-friendly online experience with our online platform and app, multiple payment options, efficient and fast fulfillment, easy returns, and excellent customer service. - We offer customers a chance to shop fashion in one of the most sustainable ways – by giving them access to overstock and ensuring that every piece of fashion that is produced is worn.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,Our Value Proposition,18.6.2,Brand partners,"Our exclusive, invitation-only membership model enables brands to discreetly clear large volumes of overstock in an exclusive environment entirely separate from their full-price channels. This protects their brand equity, supports their sustainability goals and fosters our long-term and deep strategic partnerships. Our value proposition to brand partners: - Our model provides brand partners with a sustainable solution for clearing structural overstock. - We limit the available outside information on brands and discounts through our invitation-only, closed membership model, providing our brand partners with an environment that discreetly clears overstock at scale, protecting retail pricing strategies and brand equity while maximizing overstock value. - Our ability to clear overstock at scale meets the brand partners’ strategies to reduce the number of off-price partners they trade with as they are looking for more control over their products and efficiency. - We provide our brand partners with access to an affluent and loyal customer base. - Our stock-taking wholesale model (in which the inventory risk lies with the Group) enables brands to efficiently and effectively clear overstock from their warehouses and, combined with our pre-orders, creates revenue certainty. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operation—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Marketplace” and “— Operations—Marketplace.”_ - We offer brands the opportunity to participate in the structural shift towards online with their off-price offering while protecting their brand equity. - Our marketplace model gives brands the option to keep control over their inventory and engage with the end-customer directly, while still utilizing our valuable member base and closed platform to discreetly clear overstock. Our business model also works in a challenging macro environment because off-price fashion benefits from the ability to provide brands with a clear solution to handling overstock, including during the COVID pandemic for example, as illustrated by the chart below. 123 ----- Note: Financials refer to the year ended December 31 with the exception of ‘About You’ and ‘Boohoo’ (which each have a February yearend) and asos which has been calendarized in this chart to align with a February year end.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,Our Value Proposition,18.6.3,Supply,"_Brands and merchandise offering_ Our ability to build long-term relationships with our brand partners is key to ensuring that we have first access to their stock lists. We have been able to retain business relationships with all of our top 50 brands partners from 2017 (excluding intermediaries, private label suppliers and suppliers that went out of business). During the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, we offered merchandise from approximately 3,000 brands on average. This has contributed to the breadth of our product portfolio and ensures that we are not dependent on any brand partner or fashion trend. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest brand partner accounted for approximately 4% of total revenue. Our top ten brand partners together accounted for less than 20% of our revenue in the same period. Due to the scale of our platform, we are able to purchase large volumes from our brand partners. We have significantly increased our purchasing budget in-line with the strong growth in our business. At the same time, our brand partners are reducing their number of total online off-price partners, and as the leading online off-price player in Germany by revenue, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this market consolidation. We are currently implementing sourcing initiatives that enable us to screen and add new brand partners with a proven and systematic approach while allowing us to scale our biggest partners faster. We actively manage our supplier base in order to continuously align with the assortment and volumes of merchandise we require for our business. This enables us to maintain a fresh selection of merchandise year-round – as of March 31, 2022, more than 60% of our products had been in stock for less than six months and more than 90% for less than one year. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, by product category, our revenue comprised 34% womenswear, 25% menswear, 6% kids, 13% shoes, 8% sports and 14% accessories and other categories (including, bags, jewelry, among others). Our buying strategy combines overstock with in-season and end-of-season orders, as well as pre-season collection orders, to allow us to offer seasonally relevant merchandise and a permanent assortment to our customers, while providing additional revenue to our brand partners. We supplement our merchandise from our brand partners with our private label merchandise. Our merchandising teams supports our buying teams in driving sales and profitability by managing inventory investments and driving efficiencies in the purchasing process. Key elements of this integrated approach include financial planning, assortment planning, open-to-buy inventory management, merchandise allocation and management of initial and markdown pricing to enhance gross margin and improve inventory quality. Consistent with customary practice in our industry, our relationships with many of our brand partners are not based on formalized supply agreements but, rather, the regular submission of purchase orders or price agreements renegotiated periodically between the parties on order forms. Because our assortment is permanent, rather than following the flash-sale models of other off-price platforms (in which a discount or promotion is offered by the off-price platform for a short period of time), we are able to provide this broad selection to our customers at any time. As a result, our brand partners can sell their overstock to us on the spot, without having to wait for a flash-sale window. 124 ----- _Marketplace_ In addition to our core wholesale model through which we sell the purchased inventory of branded fashion merchandise at attractive discounts, we introduced a new marketplace model in the year ended December 31, 2021. Through our marketplace model, we offer third-party fashion brands the option to market their products on our BestSecret online platform on own terms without us acquiring these products. We expect to achieve full scale operation of our marketplace model in the second half of 2022. The new marketplace is one of the core pillars of our growth strategy. Our marketplace model has helped us expand into the market for discounted in-season and end-of-season fashion and we are well-positioned to provide our customers with a wider product assortment, which we expect to drive incremental revenue. We also expect the additional products to be from affordable luxury or luxury brands, who tend to prefer marketplace models that give them more control over merchandise presentation and prices. The expanded product selection could potentially contribute to an increase in order size and a reduction in the likelihood of products being out of stock, as we attract more multi-channel brands who hold their own stock in existing product categories. We believe that these features will further support our position as the go-to destination for online off-price fashion, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Furthermore, we anticipate that the marketplace model will increase our profitability through commissions with attractive economics, while having limited inventory and working capital impact. We expect warehousing and fulfillment will typically remain in the hands of third-party suppliers. Our marketplace suppliers are also able to rely on us for fulfillment at their option, which will allow us to benefit from incremental fulfillment fees on marketplace sales.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Simultaneously, producing and/or onboarding this content should be fast and cost-effective.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Operations,18.7.3,Logistics,"We operate a modern fulfillment center in Poing, near Munich, Germany. The facility was expanded by approximately 60% in 2019 and 2020 to support our growing order volumes. The expansion enabled us to regularly ship more than 400,000 online orders with more than 1.4 million items per week during the fourth quarter of 2021. We believe our logistics operations are well-positioned to sustain our future growth with an average increase of 55% in the number of online orders shipped per week from 2020 to 2021. The extended site in Poing now has a size of 173,000 square meters (on a footprint of 48,000 square meters) and can hold up to 14 million items of inventory. Our main fulfillment center in Poing is supported by a network of three smaller sites which 125 ----- are operated by third-party providers that we brought online in 2021 to support our high growth. These additions increased our total storage capacity to approximately 18 million items of inventory. We are in the process of launching a second fulfillment center in Poland, which is expected to start its operations in 2023. We anticipate that once this new fulfillment center is fully ramped up in 2024, it will more than double our current storage capacity at a lower operating expense than our existing network. In addition to our fulfillment centers, our logistics network also includes one externally operated returns processing center in Poland that specializes in processing all returns. In the period from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2022, approximately 99% of all items have been sold within our ecosystem, with only approximately 1% of returned items being too damaged to be re-sold. In addition to managing our fulfillment and returns center network, we provide a smooth and fast delivery and returns experience at low cost to our customers, with an average delivery time of approximately 3.2 days across our focus markets. We regularly review our supply chain and last-mile setup according to customer expectations and our company priorities. For example, in 2021, we improved the delivery experience for our Dutch customers by switching to a faster last-mile carrier and by reducing delivery lead-times by one to two days on average.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Also, the fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions. We believe our business model inherently contributes to more environmental sustainability in the fashion industry. By focusing on overstock clearance, we help ensure that nearly every piece of fashion that is fit-to-wear finds an owner, thereby reducing the amount of fashion that is discarded as waste. In fact, in the year ended December 31, 2021, 79% of our total NMV was overstock merchandise. We give fashion its first life, just as second-hand retailers provide products with a second life. In addition, our online off-price model provides our customers with a more sustainable alternative to shopping in remote outlet centers. The majority of studies conducted on the topic conclude that online shopping on average leads to lower carbon emissions compared to in-store shopping. This can be attributed to consolidated shipments and well-utilized infrastructure and is especially the case for deliveries that replace private transport over long distances. We support and complement our online platform with our physical premium and outlet stores in Germany and Austria, which allow us to sell returns which we would have not been able to sell online because they have not met our strict quality standards after we have received them.

Laws and regulations applicable to our operations may differ due to different national and local laws. Applicable regulatory requirements relate, in particular, to our dealing with customers, consumer protection, and the processing of customer data.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,"States”), EU law reached a considerable degree of regulatory harmonization in several areas relevant for our",18.20.1,Data Protection,"The processing of personal data within the EU and the EEA is primarily governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, “GDPR”) which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any enterprise that is processing the personal data of living individuals (data subjects) within the EU/EEA regardless of its location and the data subjects’ citizenship or residence. It is also applicable where the processing activities are related to (1) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the EU/EEA, or (2) the monitoring of data subject’s behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the EU/EEA. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by harmonizing the EU regulatory framework of data protection. Under the GDPR, personal data may only be processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and only if the processing is covered by a legal basis (e.g., consent of the data subject, if it is necessary for the performance of a contract, to comply with a legal obligation, or if we rely on our overriding legitimate interests). Furthermore, data subjects must be informed transparently before the processing of personal data about the circumstances of the intended processing activities (e.g., purposes, retention periods, recipients of the personal data). This aims to enable the data subjects to effectively exercise their rights under the GDPR (e.g., the right of access to or the right to erasure of their personal data, if the relevant requirements are met). Furthermore, the GDPR provides restrictive requirements as regards solely automated decision making and profiling activities, which could for example impact marketing activities based on such processing of personal data. The GDPR also stipulates that certain technical and organizational measures must be implemented to protect the personal data depending on the amount of and potential risk for the personal data processed. These measures may include physical security against unauthorized access and manipulation, password security, reasonable encryption as well as protection against accidental data loss, destruction, or damage. Based on the general accountability principle of the GDPR, the processing activities and the corresponding data protection measures must be sufficiently documented (such as keeping records of processing activities). Furthermore, under the GDPR, special care and safeguards must also be taken when transferring personal data to countries outside the EEA to ensure that a level of data protection equivalent to the EU is in place for the processing of personal data. Recent legal developments in the EU, e.g., the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) of July 16, 2020 (case no C-311/18, Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems, socalled “Schrems II”), have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such data transfers. The GDPR provides for fines of up to €20.0 million or 4% of global turnover on a group basis, whichever is greater and depending on the respective breach for non-compliance with GDPR provisions. Failure to comply with the GDPR can also result in claims for compensation for financial or non-financial damages claimed by individuals under Article 82 GDPR and cease and desist claims. Non-compliance may further result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental authorities, including corresponding costs for litigation, or require us to change our operations and/or cease or modify our use of certain personal data sets. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with data protection requirements. Individual EU Member States, like Germany, also provide criminal sanctions for specific severe violations. Finally, in addition to these regulatory risks, infringement of the GDPR can lead to reputational risk and significantly undermine customers’ trust in our business. In the event of a breach of the protection of personal data, we are required to submit data breach notifications to the relevant local data protection authorities (“DPAs”) within 72 hours beginning with the awareness of a possible breach. If the breach concerned entails a high risk to the rights of the data subjects, they also need to be informed. Data subjects, DPAs and competitors, as well as consumer associations, and other authorized associations may pursue claims, including potentially mass litigation, against us for breach of the GDPR. We are subject to the supervision of the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (Bayerisches _Landesamt für Datenschutzaufsicht). To comply with regulatory requirements imposed on us, we have, inter alia,_ established a data protection organization as well as data protection processes, including, without limitation, 131 ----- appointing data protection officers, where required, and have implemented data protection policies for all employees dealing with personal data. However, the task of meeting all the data protection law requirements is complex, in particular taking into account that there are still material legal uncertainties in various respects and that data protection authorities continuously publish more detailed GDPR guidance. In addition to the GDPR, the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, “BDSG”) applies to the processing of personal data within Germany. The BDSG provides further data protection rules by making use of derogation and opening clauses in the GDPR. It stipulates, inter alia, additional requirements to limitations on the scope of data subjects’ rights and personal data processing in the employment context. Other EU Member States implemented similar local data protection acts. Furthermore, based on its data strategy, the European Union plans to comprehensively further revise the legal framework for the handling data, for example through the proposed Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. Such future changes of the legal framework may have further impacts to our processing of data.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

To the extent the TTDSG transposes the provisions of EU Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications (“ePrivacy Directive”), it prevails over the GDPR. The TTDSG provides special data protection rules and also stipulates provisions on the use of cookies and similar technologies, regardless of whether the data is personal data or not. Generally, the end user must actively consent to the use of cookies and similar technologies on the basis of clear and comprehensive information, except for cookies and similar technologies that are technically strictly essential for a service requested by the end user and for cookies and similar technologies that are used exclusively for the transmission of messages via a public telecommunications network. This is also in line with recent case law by the European Court of Justice and the German Federal Court (Bundesgerichtshof), which have both specified the requirements on the use of cookies. These provisions and rulings are relevant for our online business and the use of web tracking tools, each of which relies on cookies and similar technologies, and must be taken into account by all website operators. In addition, the TTDSG stipulates that we as a telemedia service provider must implement certain technical and organizational measures in order to protect our customers’ data and our IT systems (e.g., protection against unauthorized access and (technical) interference). The TMG continues to remain relevant to the extent information requirements are not superseded by either the GDPR or the TTDSG. The TMG requires telemedia service providers to provide certain information on their website, such as name and address and contact details (Section 5 TMG). Non-compliance with the provisions on cookies and similar technologies under the TTDSG may result in monetary fines of up to €300,000. Moreover, the requirements for the use of cookies and similar technologies is constantly evolving. For example, there is a draft Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (“ePrivacy Regulation”) that would replace the current ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws, such as German implementation laws in the TTDSG. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, data protection authorities’ recent guidance is driving increased attention to cookies and similar technologies.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

At the EU level, consumer protection is comprehensively regulated by various directives, inter alia: - Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods (“EU **Sales of Goods Directive”); - Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2011, as amended, on consumer rights; 132 ----- - Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 11, 2005, as amended, concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market; - Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (“eCommerce Directive”); - Council Directive 93/13/EEC of April 5, 1993, as amended, on unfair terms in consumer contracts; - Directive 98/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 16, 1998, as amended, on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to customers. With Directive (EU) 2019/2161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 27, 2019 as regards the better enforcement and modernization of Union consumer protection rules, the EU amended the existing EU instruments for strengthened consumer protection. EU Member States had to transpose the new rules in their national laws by November 28, 2021 and must apply these new national laws since May 28, 2022. In Germany, for example, we are therefore subject to various laws concerning the protection of consumers, which have been primarily laid down in the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch). Pursuant to these laws, we are responsible for the conformity of the shipped products with the agreed or implied quality at the time the purchase is made. And a consumer has certain statutory warranty rights (irrespective of our fault) should a product be defective at the time of delivery. If a product is defective, consumers may generally require the retailer to repair or replace the product in question free of charge. The German Civil Code also regulates distance selling contracts (Fernabsatzverträge) to protect consumer interests. The consumer benefits, among other things, from a statutory right of withdrawal from a distance selling contract within a period of 14 days after the consumer has received the respective goods and has been informed about his right of withdrawal in a manner compliant with the statutory requirements. During this time, a purchase may be cancelled without any specific reason. If the consumer has not been properly informed about his/her statutory right of withdrawal, the respective right expires twelve months and 14 days after receipt of the goods. If customers exercise their right of withdrawal, they must return the goods and the retailer must refund the purchase price, including any shipping costs originally charged. However, the retailer is not obliged to reimburse consumers for any additional costs if the consumer has expressly opted for a more expensive type of delivery (e.g., express delivery). On the other hand, the consumer must usually bear the costs of returning the goods, unless the retailer failed to inform him or her accordingly or the retailer has expressly agreed to bear these costs. The consumer also has to compensate the retailer for any loss in value of the returned goods in case such loss is due to the consumer’s handling of the goods in a way that was not necessary to examine its condition, features and functionalities of the product and the retailer has informed the consumer accordingly. With the substantial 2022 reform of German contract law (Schuldrechtsreform 2022), the German legislator has introduced further consumer-friendly regulations based on the EU Sales of Goods Directive, e.g., the reversal of the burden of proof regarding the defectiveness of the purchased item at the time of handover at the expense of the retailer extended from six months to one year. The introduced amendments to the German Civil Code entered into force on January 1, 2022. The German Civil Code, in connection with the Introductory Law to the German Civil Code (Einführungsgesetz _zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch), also stipulates that certain mandatory information must be provided to the_ consumer, including material characteristics of the purchased goods, the identity of the seller, terms of payment, delivery and/or service, price and payment details and the statutory right of withdrawal. In addition, in accordance with the German Price Indication Regulation (Preisangabenverordnung), retailers must ensure, among other things, that the price of each product is displayed clearly, precisely and legibly and shall be accessible, legible and intelligible on websites. Against the backdrop of Directive (EU) 2019/2161 as regards the better enforcement and modernization of Union consumer protection rules, the German Price Indication Regulation has been amended to include, as of May 28, 2022, new regulations for the announcement of price reductions for goods. The overall aim is to make the original price on which a price reduction is based more transparent to the consumer. To this effect, each announcement of a price reduction also has to state the lowest price applied by the retailer within a period of 30 days prior to the application of the price reduction. The aim is also to put a stop to short-term price increases in advance of price 133 ----- reductions. Infringements of the Price Indication Obligation may constitute administrative offenses that can be sanctioned with an administrative fine (Bußgeld) of up to €25,000. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to unfair competition in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, in Germany, competitors, consumer associations (Verbraucherverbände) and other authorized associations may seek to enforce alleged violations of, or the failure to comply with, the Act Against Unfair Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb). Based on the Act Against Unfair Competition, unfair commercial practices are illegal. Unfair commercial practices include, inter alia, commercial practices which are misleading (including untrue information as to the existence of a special price advantage, the price or the manner in which it is calculated), which constitute an unreasonable nuisance, which make use of harassment, coercion, or undue influence, as well as unsolicited marketing (including unsolicited e-mail marketing). Additionally, we must comply with information requirements relating to the European Online Dispute Resolution (“ODR”) platform for consumers. On January 9, 2016, Regulation (EU) 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 21, 2013 on online dispute resolution for consumer disputes (“ODR Regulation”) entered into force. It requires online retailers to disclose certain information on their websites to ensure that consumers are aware of the new ODR possibilities. Another information requirement is set up by Directive 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 21, 2013 on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes (“ADR-Directive”). In Germany, for instance, the implementation act, the Consumer Dispute Resolution Act (Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetz) generally obliges online retailers to inform their customers to what extent they are willing or obliged to participate in alternative dispute resolution procedures. Anyone who has undertaken or is obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings must provide information on the address and website of the competent alternative dispute resolution body.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Within the European internal market, the principle of free movement of goods, as stipulated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, applies. With respect to import and export of goods from countries which are not members of the EU, we must comply with national and European foreign trade and customs regulations. At the EU level our relevant regulatory framework is based on the Union Customs Code (Regulation (EU) 952/2013). In Germany, the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (Außenwirtschaftsgesetz) and the Ordinance on the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung) constitute additional regulations which, _inter alia, set forth rules of procedure. Infringements of customs or foreign trade regulations may be sanctioned with an administrative fine (Bußgeld) if categorized as administrative offenses or with a fine (Geldstrafe) or custodial sentence (Freiheitsstrafe) if categorized as criminal acts. Depending on the extent and nature of the underlying administrative offense, the respective fine may amount to up to €30,000 for violations of procedural regulations and up to €500,000 for violations of other regulations of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act. Even higher fines are possible in case of skimming of profits (Gewinnabschöpfung). The authorities may from time to time undertake external audits (Außenwirtschaftsprüfung) to assess whether we have complied with the regulations of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act and the pertaining ordinances. Whereas imports and exports within the EEA are in principle not liable to customs duty, the movement of goods beyond the frontiers of the EEA may be subject to customs. The customs control charges, _inter alia, statutory import duties (Einfuhrabgaben). Customs offices may from time to time initiate customs inspections (Zollprüfung) to assess whether customs regulations have been infringed. The countries belonging to the EEA may charge customs duties if products are exported into such non-EEA countries. We also distribute our products in Switzerland (which does not belong to the EEA). Switzerland, however, is party to a preferential agreement (Präferenzabkommen), such agreements being concluded with the European Union and certain other countries in order to facilitate the exchange of goods. The rate of customs duty for goods exported into countries which are parties to the preferential agreement is considerably lower than the regular customs duty rate. The customs administration assesses in a preference inspection (Präferenzprüfung) in accordance with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447, as amended, which applies from May 1, 2016, whether the requirements and conditions set forth in the preferential agreement are complied with.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Under this act, we are liable, regardless of fault, for damage to life, body, health and property caused by defective products to the extent we qualify as the “manufacturer” under the Product Liability Act. This may be the case if we actually manufacture the products but also if we place our own logo or name on the products of if we import the products into the EEA. The producer`s liability is limited to an amount of €85 million. In the case of damage to property, the injured party has to pay for damages up to an amount of €500. Furthermore, although there is no coherent legal framework for trade in textiles in Germany, certain laws and regulations may apply to us. For example, the German Food, Consumer Goods and Feed Act (Lebensmittel-, _Bedarfsgegenstände- und Futtermittelgesetzbuch) and the German Ordinance on Consumer Goods_ (Bedarfsgegenständeverordnung) include special regulations which aim at preventing possible damage to human health caused by textiles, especially due to toxic substances or contamination. Similarly, the German Chemicals Prohibition Ordinance (Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung) prohibits the placing on the market of certain substances and preparations as well as products containing such substances or preparations as listed in detail therein. Furthermore, textiles may only be made available on the German market if they comply with the German Product Safety Act (Produktsicherheitsgesetz) which is based on Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 3, 2001 on general product safety (“Product Safety Directive”) and complements the EU regulations on market surveillance and compliance of products (Regulation (EC) 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 9, 2008, as amended, setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 20, 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products). Under German jurisdiction, this regulation is accompanied by the Market Surveillance Act (Marktüberwachungsgesetz) which came into force on July 6, 2021. These provisions on product safety apply to a wide variety of non-food products, including clothing and footwear and are applicable to both the e-commerce and physical stores. They oblige retailers to ensure that their products comply with applicable safety requirements. Moreover, a retailer is generally required to participate in the monitoring of the safety of its products. Infringements of product safety regulations may be sanctioned with fines and in severe cases with criminal sanctions. We are further subject to the Regulation (EU) 1007/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2011 on textile fiber names and related labelling and marking of the fiber composition of textile product pursuant to which textiles may only be made available on the European market if they are labeled or marked with certain information, in particular regarding textile fibers. Depending on the implementing laws of the EU member states, infringements of the textile labeling requirements may constitute administrative offenses. In Germany the Regulation is supplemented by the Act on Textile Labeling (Textilkennzeichnungsgesetz). This law creates the necessary conditions for effective enforcement of the Regulation (EU) 1007/2011 and, in particular, lays down regulations on the powers of the authorities involved in market surveillance and on administrative offences. Administrative offenses may be sanctioned with a fine of up to €10,000. Moreover, violations of the provisions may be considered as unfair trade practices which are prohibited under the German Act Against Unfair Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb). As regards sold footwear, Directive 94/11/EC of European Parliament and Council of 23 March 1994, as amended, on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the EU Member States relating to labelling of the materials used in the main components of footwear for sale to the consumer is applicable.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii) above, the Issuer shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

The Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender Liabilities (each, a “Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise transferred by that Borrower (a “Debt Pushdown”) provided that (i) such Debt Pushdown is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any holding company of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s liabilities under the applicable Finance Documents, and (ii) the transferee in respect of such Debt Pushdown is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien lender Liabilities (as applicable). Any Debt Pushdown may (and shall upon the request of the Issuer) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and reborrow any applicable liabilities.

The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this offering memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information.” The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds,”: (i) to repay and redeem the Existing Notes and (ii) to pay certain fees and expenses in relation to the Transactions. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis. See “—The Note Guarantees.” The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will: - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations); - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of March 31, 2022, the unaudited consolidated total assets of the Guarantors represented 98.5% of the unaudited consolidated total assets of the Group and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, the unaudited aggregated unconsolidated EBITDA of the Guarantors represented substantially all of the unaudited aggregated unconsolidated EBITDA of the Issuer and its subsidiaries (as defined in this Offering Memorandum and disregarding the EBITDA of any member of the Group that generates negative EBITDA). Claims of creditors of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted 176 ----- Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

Interest on the Notes will: - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid; - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on,, and , commencing on, 2022; - be payable to the Holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed on the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Notes. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Notes. “Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11.00 a.m. London time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London or Frankfurt office of each of four major banks in the Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11.00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London or Frankfurt, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11.00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. If less than 1%, the rate shall be deemed to be 1%. If the Issuer determines in good faith prior to any Determination Date, that: (1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR; (2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently; (3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR; (4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or (5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR, 178 ----- the Issuer in consultation with a Rate Determination Agent shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that has developed or is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Notes (and any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least two Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee provided that if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information provided by the Issuer with respect to such Successor Rate or Adjustment Spread (if any) to calculate, or calculate definitely, the interest rate applicable to the Interest Period commencing immediately following notification thereof, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. For the avoidance of doubt, if, in any case, that rate determined in accordance with the above is less than 1%, such rate shall be deemed to be 1%. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread). Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent shall be responsible or liable for any action or inaction of the Issuer or its determination of the Successor Rate. Nothing in the Indenture will require or oblige the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to agree to any amendment or modification in connection with such new rate which may, in its opinion, expose the Trustee, Paying Agent or Calculation Agent to any additional liabilities or increase in its obligations or decrease in its rights or protections. “Eurozone” means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include, 2022. “Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the Issuer at the expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under (a), the Issuer. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (1) EUR 1.0 million and (2) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or.0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law. 179 ----- If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of a series of Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer shall deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); 193 ----- (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer. A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to 194 ----- the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. 199 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by written notice to the Issuer, or, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under the definition of “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. 219 ----- Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, cost or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, cost or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give written notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant breach of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity and/or security to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred. 220 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income or, in certain cases, general category income. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued stated interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such stated interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

In such event, U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally include OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID because the stated principal amount exceeds the issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined _de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). The amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such 269 ----- accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price with respect to the Notes, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the EURIBOR applicable to the Notes as of the Issue Date. OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income or, in certain cases, general category income. OID on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID, with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated at the spot rate on the date of the taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S. holder, increased by OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The aggregate exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest,” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss recognized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and 270 ----- will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Such transactions are referred to as “prohibited transactions” and include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes (or any interest therein) by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the agents and our and their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a 272 ----- direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain church plans and non-U.S. plans, which are not subject to ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may contain fiduciary responsibility requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should consider the impact of Similar Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be acquired or held by a Plan or any person investing assets of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition (or any interest therein) will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a violation of any Similar Laws. Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed that either (i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds such Note or interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Plan, and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan, or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes (or an interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, in the case of a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan, a violation of any Similar Laws. Each purchaser and transferee of the Notes that is, or is acting on behalf of, an ERISA Plan, will be deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties or any of their respective affiliates has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Notes and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes. The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Such 273 ----- transactions are referred to as “prohibited transactions” and include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the agents and our and their respective affiliates are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain church plans and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should consider the impact of Similar Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and agreed that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.5,,107.5.1,,".The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition and holding of the Notes by (a) any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA, (b) any “plan” as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code, including individual retirement accounts and other arrangements, and (c) any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of any such employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in the entity (pursuant to Section 3(42) of ERISA and regulations promulgated under ERISA by the U.S. Department of Labor) (each of the foregoing, an “ERISA Plan”). Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; however, such plans may be subject to federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”). Any fiduciary of such a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan considering an investment in the Notes (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under such laws or regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,Agreement”).,25.1.1,,"The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of the final Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement until the date falling 60 days after the date of the final Offering Memorandum without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important _Information” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_ Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors” and “Notice to Certain Other _Investors.”_ The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, 275 ----- contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes and the Note Guarantees are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Exchange for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for _the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be      business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following      business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not _be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 30 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial 276 ----- Purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates are lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. UniCredit Bank AG, is acting as Security Agent and Facility Agent for the New Revolving Credit Facility and as Security Agent for the Notes. Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is acting as Trustee for the Notes. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates, they may routinely hedge their credit exposure to us or our affiliates in a manner consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Each Initial Purchaser has acknowledged that: - no prospectus has been filed with any securities commission or similar regulatory authority in Canada in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes, the Notes have not been, and will not be, qualified for sale under the securities laws of Canada or any province or territory thereof and no securities commission or similar regulatory authority in Canada has reviewed or in any way passed upon the Offering Memorandum or the merits of the Notes and any representation to the contrary is an offence. Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that: - it has not offered, sold or distributed and will not offer, sell or distribute any Notes, directly or indirectly, in Canada or to or for the benefit of any resident of Canada, other than in compliance with applicable securities laws and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) any offer or sale of the Notes in Canada will be made only to purchasers that are “accredited investors” (as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions (“NI 45**106”) or, in Ontario, as such term is defined in section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario)), that are also “permitted clients” (as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration _Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations), that are purchasing as principal, or are_ deemed to be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, and that are not a person created or used solely to purchase or hold the Notes as an ""accredited investor"" as described in paragraph (m) of the definition of ""accredited investor"" in section 1.1 of NI 45-106; (b) it is either (I) appropriately registered under applicable Canadian securities laws in each relevant province or territory to sell and deliver the Notes, (II) such sale and delivery will be made through an affiliate of it that is so registered if the affiliate is registered in a category that permits such sale and has agreed to make such sale and delivery in compliance with the representations, warranties and agreements set out herein, or (III) it is relying on an exemption from the dealer registration requirements under applicable Canadian securities laws and has complied with the requirements of that exemption; and (c) it has not and will not distribute or deliver any offering memorandum, or any other offering material in connection with any offering of the Notes, in or to a resident of Canada except in compliance with applicable Canadian securities laws. 277 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,Germany,23.1.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the proceedings; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any judgment which became _res judicata_ rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict any such judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grundrechte). - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. 287 ----- In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States. 288 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests.” The determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other EU Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU Member State have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation. If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary 289 ----- proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU Member State are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU Member State. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU Member State in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that EU Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex fori _concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The court of a EU Member State with which a request to open main insolvency proceedings has been lodged retains exclusive jurisdiction to open such proceedings where the center of the debtor’s main interests is moved to another EU Member State after that request has been lodged, but before that court has delivered a decision on it. The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU Member State so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU Member State in another EU Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the company has assets. The Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies in one or more EU Member States (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that, according to German case law, the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks. A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values) unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend _wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve months (positive Fortführungsprognose)._ 290 ----- A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debt when they fall due. In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being unable to pay its debt as and when_ they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a European stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder or partner gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) or under certain circumstances the shareholders of such company must file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay; however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of over- indebtedness at the latest six weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able_ to service its payments obligations, but will presumably (predominant likelihood) not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, in the case of imminent illiquidity only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings. A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung), if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turnaround plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period of either preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung) or the preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. Unless the debtor has applied for debtorin possession-proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called debtor-inpossession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements: - a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted); - revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the fiscal year preceding the filing; and/or - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis. The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions 291 ----- taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der _Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter). The court opens_ formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in- possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_ of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business- experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the debtor. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - Unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of assets of the German subsidiary of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by management of a German subsidiary of the Issuer after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the Issuer’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and - claims against the Issuer or its German subsidiaries may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. 292 ----- Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is—in principle— subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a _pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte)) as well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Note Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after satisfaction of such secured creditors. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement 293 ----- proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Importantly, under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently a new insolvency law on group of companies has entered into force on April 21, 2018 to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz _zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), mainly intended to provide for a better coordination_ of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. It does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1329,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1329.3,Germany,1329.3.2,Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and other Security,"Any guarantee or other security granted by a German Guarantor incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or GmbH) (“GmbH”) is subject to certain provision of the Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbHG) (“GmbHG”). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interest agree to enforce the guarantees or security interest against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and Guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH (incorporated or established in Germany) will contain such limitation language in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German 294 ----- (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), inter alia, a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the subsidiary guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes, of the subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees. Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Note Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer should, as of today, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor, the enforcement of the Note Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded, according to certain provisions contained in the limitation language, if any high court decisions (höchstrichterliche _Entscheidung) of a German Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice_ (Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an affiliated company within the meaning of Section 15 AktG of such guarantor and/or security grantor (other than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of the enforcement of such guarantee and/or security trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to former section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG, now contained in section 15b paragraph of the Germany Insolvency Code (Insolvenzverordnung). The limitations set out above apply mutatis mutandis if the Guarantee or security is granted by a German Guarantor incorporated or established in Germany as a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a general partner (Komplementär) organized in the legal form of (i) a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or (ii) an entrepreneurs company with limited liability (Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)), in relation to such general partner (Komplementär).",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the security providers under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the security providers for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. 295 ----- German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings, subject to specific periods. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the security were avoided, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received by the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security interest. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases: - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing); - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (or guarantees) (Sicherung) or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such detrimental effect); - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted or paid 296 ----- gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intent to prejudice its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary knew of such intention at the time of such act; in the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the avoidability of acts is limited to four years. “Knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the other party act disadvantaged the other creditors. In case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments shall establish the rebuttable presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or an economically equivalent claim if (i) in case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debt generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended the “COVInsAG”), however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans under German insolvency law clawback provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of third party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts. 297 ----- Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und –restrukturierungsgesetz) (“Company Stabilization and Restructuring",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. The CovInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans that were granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 or were granted between September 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 if the debtor had been over indebted but not illiquid or were granted between January 1 and April 30, 2021 if the debtor had submitted an application for state aid under the German aid scheme on reasonable grounds and the state aid had been sufficient to prevent for the insolvency and, in each case, and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. 299 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met. Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes or the Note Guarantees), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can — under certain circumstances — even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies. The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., are lease of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). 298 ----- The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review or supervision by a court; restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings).

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2021.

The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments apply for the first time in 2022, but do not have an impact on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group. _2.2.1_ _New or amended IFRS applied in the fiscal year_ The Group applied all standards and interpretations (including amendments) as adopted by the EU in its consolidated financial statements which are mandatory for reporting periods starting on or after 1 January 2021. On March 2021, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 that increases the scope of the amendment that was issued on 28 May 2020 by the IASB. This contains a practical expedient for lessees in terms of accounting for rent concessions granted by the lessor as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The practical expedient gives the lessee the option not to assess whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. EU endorsement of the amendment by the European Commission took place on 30 August 2021. This allows lessees to apply the amendments to annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021. Early application is permitted, also to financial statements not yet approved for publication on 31 March 2021. The Group did not make use of the practical expedient. Other amendments to standards that were mandatory from 1 January 2021 relate to amendments to IFRS 4 (insurance contracts - deferral of IFRS 9) and IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (interest rate benchmark reform - Phase 2). Application of the amendments did not have any effect on the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2021. _2.2.2_ _New or amended IFRS not yet applied_ The following accounting standards relevant for the Group had already been issued by the IASB before the consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue, but their adoption is not yet mandatory and they have not yet been adopted by the Group and do not have any material impact on the Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position and performance.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

It also includes additional remarks for business combinations. The amendments specify that the “cost of fulfilling a contract” comprises “costs that relate directly to the contract”. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.

The consolidated statement of comprehensive income is prepared based on the nature of expense method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared based on IAS 7. The consolidated financial statements are prepared based on historical cost on the reporting date, 31 December 2021.

This applies regardless of whether the price can be directly observed or is estimated using a measurement method. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (EUR k), unless otherwise indicated. Due to rounding, it is possible that figures may not add up exactly to the total stated, and the percentages presented may not precisely reflect the figures they correspond to.

Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. As a general rule, subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements by way of full consolidation from the time when the Group obtained control over or the ability to control the subsidiary. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group F 22 ----- loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,172,INDEX TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,172.110,2.6** **Use of estimates and assumptions,172.110.1,,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that have effects on the amounts carried and the related disclosures. Although these estimates are based on the current events and measures to the best of management’s knowledge, there may be deviations between estimated and actual results. Significant estimates and assumptions have been used for the following matters in particular: - Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID-19 impact) - Determination and assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes - The determination of provisions for restoration expenses and other provisions - Assumptions for the calculation of returns and unredeemed coupons - Inventory valuation - Segment reporting - Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables - Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 - Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16 - Assumptions with regard to useful live of the Group’s customer base due to the structural shift towards e-commerce F 25 ----- These key forward-looking assumptions and estimates, which involve a significant risk of changing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year, are discussed below. _2.6.1_ _Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID-19 impact)_ All non-financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are tested for impairment if there are indicators that the asset may be impaired. Regardless of indicators of impairment, goodwill acquired in business combinations is tested for impairment once a year at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. This assessment implies significant judgment and estimates, in particular in light of the uncertainties in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the shift to the online market business in general, and this was taken into account in the impairment testing for goodwill and the review of useful lives for the intangible assets recognized using the purchase method in compliance with IFRS 3. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. This is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model that is the basis for the calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal used as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant to goodwill. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 5.1. _2.6.2_ _Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes_ Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for prior years. Various factors such as past experience with tax field audits and different treatment of tax regulations by tax authorities are considered. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profit. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainty. Consequently, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets recognized at the reporting date. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the income statement. _2.6.3_ _Determination of provisions for restorations expenses and other provisions_ The determination of provisions for restoration expenses requires assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rates, expected costs and timing of these costs. If the interest effect resulting from the discounting is significant, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. Provisions mainly comprise provisions for restoration expenses and provisions for restructuring. Whether a present obligation is probable or not requires judgment. The nature and type of risks for these provisions differ, and management’s judgment is applied regarding the nature and extent of obligations in deciding if an outflow of resources is probable or not. As of 31 December 2021, long-term provisions were discounted at an interest rate of 7.5% (prior year: 7.5%). In the case of discounting, timing-related interest effects are recognized as financial expenses. Further details are described in note 5.11. _2.6.4_ _Calculation of returns and unredeemed gift vouchers_ (a) Returns For transactions with a statutory 14-day or longer refund policy, the Group calculates the amount of the expected returns as of the reporting date based on historical return rates under consideration of the actual returns until the date of preparing the consolidated financial statements, which are taken into account in order to reduce revenue. As of 31 December 2021, deferred sales amounted to EUR 39,666k (prior year: EUR 22,377k). The right to recover possession of expected returns is reported under other current non-financial assets. F 26 ----- (b) Unredeemed gift vouchers The acquiring customer has a claim from the sale of vouchers for fulfillment up to a period of three years. If vouchers sold are not redeemed within this period, the Group realizes the revenue from the voucher sale. Liabilities from the sale of gift vouchers are recognized under other liabilities and amounted as of 31 December 2021 to EUR 1,983k (prior year: EUR 1,723k). _2.6.5_ _Inventory valuation_ Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary costs to make the sale. Estimates are necessary to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. Further details are given in note 5.6. _2.6.6_ _Segment reporting_ IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) of the Group for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the respective segments. In prior periods, the Group has reported in two segments: “Online” and “Stationary retail business”. In recent years, the Group has been able to leverage the accelerated structural shift to e-commerce and set a clear focus on online business. This transition has resulted in a change in the internal organizational setup, the management structure, and the internal reporting lines. As the internal organizational and management structure and the internal reports submitted to the CODM form the basis for determining the segment reporting format of the Group, the Group has therefore realigned its segment reporting. For fiscal year 2021 and thereafter, the Group segments will be “Germany” and “International”. Primary emphasis is placed on the key performance indicators revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The recognition and measurement methods of the reportable segments correspond to the consolidated recognition and measurement methods described in note 6.3. _2.6.7_ _Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables_ The determination of the necessity and amount of valuation allowances on receivables requires assumptions and estimates regarding the credit risk and underlying time intervals. In the case of a return debit, the Company informs the customer and defines a period for payment. When the defined time period has elapsed, written warnings are sent to the customers. Further details are given in note 5.7. and note 5.17. The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due and the Group’s historical default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on expectations as to the collectability of the receivables. _2.6.8_ _Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16_ The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering the debt structure of the Group and the useful life of the leased assets. To measure lease liabilities the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group estimates the incremental borrowing rate by using observable input factors. _2.6.9_ _Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16_ The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering the overall business development as well as the term of existing leases. _2.6.10_ _Assumptions with regard to useful live of the Group’s customer base_ In general, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the structural shift towards e-commerce. Testing the useful lives at the end of 2020 showed the need for prospective adjustment of the remaining useful life of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base from the remaining 10 years to 5 years from the 2021 reporting period onwards. This change in estimate of the useful live as such caused an increase of the annual amortization of EUR 6,640k. F 27 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. In case of any structural changes of the respective CGUs within the Group, an impairment review and potential reallocation of the Goodwill according to IAS 36 is performed.

Since the Group has price discretion in its sales transactions and also bears the inventory and credit risk, the Group generally acts as a principal and is therefore the principal party of all sales transactions.

The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. For the purpose of measuring current German taxes, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15% is applied to distributed and retained earnings and a solidarity surcharge rate of 5.5% is applied to that amount. That yields a tax rate of 15.83%. In addition, German trade tax is imposed on profits earned in Germany. The trade tax is based on the assessment rates of the various municipalities and the basic federal rate, which has been a flat rate of 3.5% according to Sec. 11 (2) GewStG [“Gewerbesteuergesetz”: German Trade Tax Act] since the corporate tax reform in 2008. The trade tax varies depending on the different assessment rates of the municipalities, but a flat rate of 11.41% is applied in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Leases are typically entered into for periods of 2 to 22 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is broken down into an interest component and a principal repayment. Interest is recognized in the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for the reporting period (effective interest method). It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. F 33 ----- Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - renewal options - variable lease payments that are based on an index or an (interest) rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee uses the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date - any initial direct costs, and - restoration costs. Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

Changes are recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For its online customers, the Group offers the option to purchase on account.

The Group classifies its financial assets as “at amortized cost”. No financial assets are held “at fair value through profit or loss” or “at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)” on the reporting date. At initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount, are measured “at amortized cost”. A gain or loss on such an instrument subsequently measured at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is sold or impaired. Interest income from this type of financial asset is included in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. Credit risks related to debt instruments at amortized cost held by the Group at the reporting date are considered to be low. Therefore, the regular approach in accordance with IFRS 9 requires the Group to determine, at inception as well as on an ongoing basis during the lifetime of the debt instrument, the allowance as the credit losses expected in the next 12 months. If the credit risk were to increase and no longer be regarded as low-risk, lifetime expected credit losses would have to be recognized. The Group considers credit risk as significantly increased if debt instruments are past due for more than 30 days. For trade receivables, a separate approach is applied for measuring impairment (see 2.19, 5.7 and 5.17.). Other financial assets are included in other current financial assets, except for those with maturity dates more than 12 months after the reporting date, which are presented as non-current financial assets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the duration of the obligation using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount upon initial recognition. The embedded prepayment option for the Notes is considered to be closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. The Group defines “closely related” up to a 5% difference between amortized cost and redemption price as of the redemption date. Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade and other payables and other liabilities, are measured at amortized cost. Trade and other payables are amounts owed as consideration for goods or services provided to the Group in the normal course of business including amounts owed to a payment service provider governing the settlement of supplier liabilities. In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are therefore classified as current; otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or nominal value.

Solid growth Solid growth EBIT growth ...................................................................................................................... Solid growth Solid growth To conduct the impairment test, the total carrying amount of the cash-generating units is compared against the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the fair value less costs of disposal, based on discounted future cash flows. Expected cash flows are determined based on a suitable planning process. Internal information and external macroeconomic indicators are taken into consideration. The current detailed planning period covers four years. Generally, a growth rate of 2.0% to 2.5% (see table above) is applied for the time after the detailed planning period. As a general rule, the discount factor is calculated as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) by application of the capital asset pricing model. For this purpose, a peer group is used for all groups of cash-generating units operating in the same business segment. The beta factor is calculated annually based on freely available market data. For both CGUs the same beta factor was applied. A country risk premium was applied for the CGU International in addition. Furthermore, the discount factors are determined on the basis of the following exemplary assumptions: a base interest rate of 0.1% (prior year: -0.2%) and a market risk premium of 7.5% (prior year: 7.5%) as of 31 December 2021 in Germany. Country-specific risk premiums are applied to both the equity cost rate and the debt capital cost rate, based on the credit rating of the respective country. For the purposes of estimating the development of revenues, EBITDA margin, specific growth rates were assumed in conducting the impairment test of the respective CGUs. Furthermore, customary market EBITDA margin were assumed for calculating sustainable earnings. The annual impairment test as of 31 December 2021 confirmed the recoverability of the capitalized goodwill for the CGU ‘Online’ and Germany and International respectively. In addition to the impairment test, three sensitivity analyses were conducted for both the Online cash-generating unit and the Germany and International. For the first sensitivity analysis, the discount factor was increased by 0.5 percentage points (prior year: 0.5 percentage points). For the second sensitivity analysis, a flat-rate deduction of 10% (prior year: 10%) was applied to the assumed EBITDA margin in perpetuity. The third sensitivity analysis included a reduction of the growth rate in terminal value by 0.5 percentage points. These changes in the underlying assumptions did not lead to the need to recognize any impairment loss for the Online, Germany or International cash-generating unit.

The registered office of PrestigeBidCo GmbH (the parent) is located at Margaretha-Ley-Ring 27, Aschheim, Germany. The Company is registered with Munich Local Court (HRB 227078). Based on a framework agreement signed 24 October 2016, PrestigeBidCo GmbH acquired Schustermann & Borenstein Holding GmbH and all its subsidiaries (S&B Group) with an effective date as the basis for consolidation as of 19 January 2017. Prior to the acquisition of Schustermann & Borenstein Holding GmbH, PrestigeBidCo GmbH issued a Senior Secured Note (“Note”) as of 20 December 2016 in the amount of EUR 260,000k with a maturity of seven years. The Group operates as an online and brick-and-mortar fashion retailer of reduced designer fashion for registered members.

A group management report and the obligatory disclosures to be made under German commercial law pursuant to Sec. 315e (1) HGB were added to the consolidated financial statements. To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of comprehensive income have been summarized. These items are shown separately and explained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The presentation and the components of the consolidated financial statements comply with the rules in IAS 1.10. The consolidated statement of comprehensive income is prepared based on the nature of expense method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared based on IAS 7. The consolidated financial statements are prepared based on historical cost on the reporting date, 31 December 2020. Historical costs are generally based on the fair value of the consideration paid in exchange for the asset. The fair value is the price that would be received in orderly transactions between market participants on the measurement date for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of liabilities. This applies regardless of whether the price can be directly observed or is estimated using a measurement method. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (EUR k), unless otherwise indicated. Rounding differences may occur. The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year. The separate financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same reporting date as the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in section 2.4 of the notes. The management prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. F 68 ----- The Group recorded revenue of EUR 615,833k in the 2020 reporting period, which corresponds to an increase of roughly 8% on the prior-year figure of EUR 571,261k. In a market shaped for large parts of the year by uncertainty and restrictions due to the pandemic, this development demonstrates the Group’s extraordinary resilience and the strength of its business model. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 103,564k as of 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: EUR 76,033k), with an unutilized revolving loan facility of EUR 50,000k.

On 28 May 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16. This contains a practical expedient for lessees in terms of accounting for rent concessions granted by the lessor as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The practical expedient gives the lessee the option not to assess whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. EU endorsement by the European Commission took place on 9 October 2020. This allows lessees to apply the amendments to annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. Early application is permitted, also to financial statements not yet approved for publication on 28 May 2020. The Group did not make use of the practical expedient. Other amendments to standards that were mandatory from 1 January 2020 relate to amendments to IFRS 3 (clarifying amendment of the definition of a business), IAS 1 and IAS 8 (narrow-focus amendment of the definition of material) and amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 (interest rate benchmark reform for hedges).

Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. F 70 ----- As a general rule, subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements by way of full consolidation from the time when the Group obtained control over or the ability to control the subsidiary. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value. The consolidated financial statements of the Group include: _2.3.1_ _Basis of consolidation and Group information_ The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2019.

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary costs of disposal. Estimates are necessary to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. Further details are given in note 5.5. _2.4.6_ _Segment reporting_ IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) of the Group for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the respective segments, i.e., “Brick-and-mortar business” and “Online”. Thus, the internal organizational and management structure and the internal reports submitted to the Management Board form the basis for determining the segment reporting format of the Group. Primary emphasis is placed on the indicators revenue and EBITDA. The recognition and measurement methods of the reportable segments correspond to the consolidated recognition and measurement methods described in note 6.3. The Group applies IFRS 8 voluntarily. _2.4.7_ _Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables_ The determination of the necessity and amount of valuation allowances on receivables requires assumptions and estimates regarding the credit risk and underlying time intervals. In the case of a return debit, the Company informs the customer and defines a period for payment. When the defined time period has elapsed, written warnings are sent to the customers. Further details are given in note 5.6 and note 5.16. The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due and the Group’s historical default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on expectations as to the collectability of the receivables. _2.4.8_ _Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16_ The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering the debt structure of the Group and the useful life of the leased assets. _2.4.9_ _Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16_ The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering the overall business development as well as the term of existing leases. _2.4.10_ _Assumptions with regard to useful lives of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” brand name and the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base_ The rebranding of the Group in 2019 to the uniform BestSecret brand name includes a dual branding and transition period of three years for the German and Austrian Schustermann & Borenstein stores. The goal of the rebranding F 73 ----- is to emphasize the shared and validate the business development strategy exclusively under one brand name. Therefore, the remaining useful life of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” brand name was reduced from 28 years to 3 years in the 2019 reporting period due to the rebranding. Furthermore, as part of the omni-channel strategy, the remaining useful life of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base was likewise reduced from the remaining 18 years to 12 years in the 2019 reporting period. In general, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the move to the online market segment. Testing the useful lives at the end of 2020 showed the need for prospective adjustment of the remaining useful life of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base from the remaining 10 years to 5 years from the 2021 reporting period onwards. This will cause annual amortization to increase from EUR 6,640k to EUR 13,281k from the 2021 reporting period. From the sale of vouchers, the acquiring customer arises a claim for fulfillment up to a limitation period of 3 years. If vouchers sold are not redeemed within this limitation period, the Group realizes the revenue from the voucher F 113 ----- sale. Liabilities from the sale of gift vouchers are recognized under other non-financial liabilities and amounted as of December 31, 2019 to KEUR 1,698 (previous year: KEUR 1,628). _2.4.5_ _Inventory valuation_ As part of the inventory valuation, the net selling price must be determined for testing inventories of lower of cost or market value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated necessary selling expenses. Estimates are necessary to determine the sales proceeds that can be achieved in the normal course of business. Further details are given in Note 5.5. _2.4.6_ _Segment reporting_ IFRS 8 requires that operating segments be defined on the basis of the internal reports of corporate divisions that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) of the Group for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the given segments “Offline” and “Online”. Thus, the internal organizational and management structure and the internal reports submitted to the Management Board form the basis for determining the segment reporting format of the Group. Primary emphasis is placed on the indicator Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin as well as EBITDA. The recognition and measurement methods of the reportable segments correspond to the consolidated recognition and measurement methods described in Note 6.3. The Group applies IFRS 8 voluntarily. _2.4.7_ _Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables_ The determination of necessity and allowances on receivables requires assumptions and estimates regarding the credit risk and applied time intervals. In the case of a return debit, the company informs the customer and prolongs the payment term for a week. When the defined time period elapsed written warnings are sent to the customers. Further details are given in Note 5.6 and Note 5.16. The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due and Group’s historical observed default rates. The default rates are evaluated based on the expectations regarding the collectability of the receivables. _2.4.8_ _Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16_ The interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 was determined considering the debt structure of the Group and the useful life time of the leased assets. _2.4.9_ _Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16_ The lease term of an asset is determined by considering options to terminate or extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The possibility of the use of termination or extension options is appreciated by considering the overall business development as well as considering a relation to the lease term of existing contracts. _2.4.10_ _Assumptions with regard to useful lives of trademark “Schustermann & Borenstein” and customer relationship “Schustermann & Borenstein” due to rebranding_ The rebranding of our Group in 2019 to the uniform BestSecret Brand includes a dual branding and transition period of 3 years for the German and Austrian Schustermann & Borenstein stores. The goal of the rebranding shall emphasize our common identity and validate the business development strategy exclusively under one trademark. Therefore, the remaining useful lifetime of the trademark “Schustermann & Borenstein” was reduced from remaining 28 years to 3 years due to rebranding issues. As a result, the yearly amortization for the trademark “Schustermann & Borenstein” increased from kEUR -933 to kEUR -8,726. As part of the omni-channel strategy the remaining useful lifetime of the customer relationship “Schustermann & Borenstein” was reduced from remaining 18 years to 12 years.

Although these estimates are based on the current events and measures to the best of management’s knowledge, there may be deviations between estimated and actual results. Significant estimates and assumptions have been used for the following matters in particular: - Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID impact) - Determination and assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes - The determination of provisions for restoration expenses and other provisions - Assumptions for the calculation of returns and unredeemed coupons - Inventory valuation - Segment reporting - Assessment of the necessity and amount of allowances on receivables F 71 ----- - Interest rate in connection with IFRS 16 - Assumptions with regard to making use of termination or extension options in connection with IFRS 16 - Assumptions with regard to useful lives of the “Schustermann & Borenstein” brand name and the “Schustermann & Borenstein” customer base due to rebranding These key forward-looking assumptions and estimates, which involve a significant risk of changing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year, are discussed below. _2.4.1_ _Impairment of non-financial assets (including forecasts and COVID impact)_ All non-financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are tested for impairment if there are indicators that the asset may be impaired. Regardless of indicators of impairment, goodwill acquired in business combinations is tested for impairment once a year at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. This assessment implies significant judgment and estimates, in particular in light of the uncertainties in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the shift to the online market segment in general, and this was taken into account in the impairment testing for goodwill and the review of useful lives for the intangible assets recognized using the purchase method in compliance with IFRS 3. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. This is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model that is the basis for the calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal used as well as the expected future cash flows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. These estimates are most relevant to goodwill. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the goodwill, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 5.2. _2.4.2_ _Assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and income taxes_ Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Different interpretations of tax laws may result in additional tax payments for prior years. Various factors such as past experience with tax field audits and different treatment of tax regulations by tax authorities are considered. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profit. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These judgments and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainty. Consequently, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets recognized at the reporting date. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the income statement. _2.4.3_ _Determination of provisions for restorations expenses and other provisions_ The determination of provisions for restoration expenses requires assumptions and estimates regarding the discount rates, expected costs and timing of these costs. If the interest effect resulting from the discounting is significant, provisions are discounted at a pre-tax interest rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. Provisions mainly comprise provisions for restoration expenses and provisions for tax risks. Whether a present obligation is probable or not requires judgment. The nature and type of risks for these provisions differ, and management’s judgment is applied regarding the nature and extent of obligations in deciding if an outflow of resources is probable or not. As of 31 December 2020, long-term provisions were discounted at an interest rate of 7.5% (prior year: 7.3%).

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognized subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Leases are typically entered into for periods of 2 to 22 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is broken down into an interest component and a principal repayment. Interest is recognized in the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for the reporting period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - renewal options - variable lease payments that are based on an index or an (interest) rate F 79 ----- - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee uses the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date - any initial direct costs, and - restoration costs. Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.

Changes are recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For its online customers, the Group offers the option to purchase on account. In connection with this payment option, the Group works with a factoring provider, transferring substantially all risks and rewards resulting from the receivables to the factoring company and derecognizing receivables in the statement of financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The Group classifies its financial assets as “at amortized cost”. No financial assets are held “at fair value through profit or loss” or “at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)” on the reporting date. At initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount, are measured “at amortized cost”. A gain or loss on such an instrument subsequently measured at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is sold or impaired. Interest income from this type of financial asset is included in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. Credit risks related to debt instruments at amortized cost held by the Group at the reporting date are considered to be low. Therefore, the regular approach in accordance with IFRS 9 requires the Group to determine, at inception as well as on an ongoing basis during the lifetime of the debt instrument, the allowance as the credit losses expected in the next 12 months. If the credit risk were to increase and no longer be regarded as low-risk, lifetime expected credit losses would have to be recognized. The Group considers credit risk as significantly increased if debt instruments are past due for more than 30 days. For trade receivables, a separate approach is applied for measuring impairment (see 5.16).

221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1330,3.** **CAPITAL MANAGEMENT,1330.195,2.20** **Financial liabilities,1330.195.1,,"Financial liabilities are recognized when a group company is a contractual party to a financial instrument on the settlement date. Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the duration of the obligation using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount upon initial recognition. The embedded prepayment option for the Note is considered to be closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. The Group defines “closely related” up to a 5% difference between amortized cost and redemption price as of the redemption date. Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade payables and other liabilities, are measured at amortized cost. Trade payables are amounts owed as consideration for goods or services provided to the Company in the normal course of business. In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are therefore classified as current; otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or nominal value. The Group derecognizes a financial liability when the related obligation has been paid, canceled or has expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized financial liability and the consideration received or due is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

Solid growth Moderate growth EBIT growth ............................................................................... Solid growth Moderate growth To conduct the impairment test, the total carrying amount of the cash-generating units is compared against the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the fair value less costs to sell, based on discounted future cash flows. Expected cash flows are determined based on a suitable planning process. Internal experience values and external macroeconomic indicators are taken into consideration. The detailed planning period generally covers five years. Generally, a growth rate between 1.0% and 2.0% is applied for the time after the five-year period. As a general rule, the discount factor is calculated as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) by application of the capital asset pricing model. For this purpose, a peer group is used for all groups of F 86 ----- cash-generating units operating in the same business segment. The individual business risk is reflected through the use of specific beta factor. The beta factor is calculated annually based on freely available market data. Furthermore, the discount factors are determined on the basis of the following exemplary assumptions: a base interest rate of -0.2% (prior year: 0.3%) and a market risk premium of 7.5% (prior year: 7.5%) as of 31 December 2020 in Germany. Country-specific risk premiums are applied to both the equity cost rate and the debt capital cost rate, based on the credit rating of the respective country. For the purposes of estimating the development of revenues, EBIT and EBIT margins, specific growth rates were assumed in conducting the impairment test of the respective CGUs. Furthermore, customary market EBIT margins were assumed for calculating sustainable earnings. The annual impairment test as of 31 December 2020 confirmed the recoverability of the capitalized goodwill for the cash-generating unit ‘Online’. For the cash-generating units in the ‘Brick-and-mortar’ segment (stores), the recoverable amount was EUR 150,207k as of 31 December 2020. This led to an impairment loss for the full amount of the capitalized goodwill, amounting to EUR 50,846k in total. The test showed for the cash-generating units in the Brick-and-mortar segment that the fair value less costs of disposal does not exceed the carrying amount.

A Group management report and the obligatory disclosures to be made under German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB were added to the consolidated financial statements. To improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of comprehensive income have been summarized. These items are shown separately and explained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The presentation and the components of the consolidated financial statements is conformant with the provisions of IAS 1.10. The consolidated statement of comprehensive income is prepared based on the nature of expense method. The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared based on IAS 7. The consolidated financial statements are prepared based on historical cost on the reporting date, December 31, 2019. Historical costs are generally based on the fair value of the consideration paid in exchange for the asset. The fair value is the price that would be received in orderly transactions between market participants on the measurement date for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of liabilities. This applies regardless of whether the price can be directly observed or is estimated using a measurement method. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (KEUR), except when otherwise indicated. Rounding differences may occur. The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The separate financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation are prepared as of the same reporting date as the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires Management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in section 2.4 of the Notes.

For the purpose of measuring current German taxes, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15% is applied to distributed and retained earnings and a solidarity surtax rate of 5.5% is applied to that amount. That yields a tax rate of 15.83%. In addition, the German trade tax is imposed on profits earned in Germany.

The trade tax varies, depending on the different assessment rates of the municipalities, but a flat rate of 11.70% is applied in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Rental contracts are typically made for periods of 2 to 22 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability at the date of which the leased asset is available for use by the group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable - renewal options - variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate - amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the group’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date - any initial direct costs, and - restoration costs. Payments associated with short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. The Group recognizes leases which fulfill both conditions within the category low-value asset.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The F 120 ----- allowance for trade receivables is determined based on lifetime expected credit losses, which are calculated as the present value of expected cash shortfalls. Changes are recognized as other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group offers for its online customers the option to purchase on account. In connection with this payment option the Group works with a factoring provider, transferring substantially all risks and rewards resulting from the receivables to the factoring company and derecognizing receivables in the statement of financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1330,3.** **CAPITAL MANAGEMENT,1330.369,2.18** **Other financial assets,1330.369.1,,"Other financial assets are initially recognized at the settlement day. The Group classifies its financial assets as “at amortized cost”. No financial assets are held “at fair value through profit or loss” or “at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)” on the reporting date. At initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount, are measured “at amortized cost”. A gain or loss on such instrument subsequently measured at amortized cost is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is sold or impaired. Interest income from this type of financial asset is included in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. Credit risks related to debt instruments at amortized cost held by the Group at the balance sheet date are considered to be low. Therefore, the regular approach in accordance with IFRS 9 requires the Group to determine, at inception as well as on an ongoing basis during the lifetime of the debt instrument, the impairment provision as the credit losses expected in the next twelve months. If the credit risk were to increase and no longer be regarded as low-risk, lifetime expected credit losses would have to be recognized. The Group considers credit risk as significantly increased if debt instruments are past due for more than 30 days. For trade receivables a separate approach is applied for measuring impairment (refer to 5.16). Other financial assets are included in other current assets, except for maturity dates more than twelve months after the balance sheet date, in which case they are presented as other non-current assets.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
221,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1330,3.** **CAPITAL MANAGEMENT,1330.370,2.19** **Financial liabilities,1330.370.1,,"Financial liabilities are recognized when a Group company is a contractual party to a financial instrument at the settlement day. Financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the duration of the obligation using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial liability and to allocate interest expenses to the respective periods. The effective interest rate is the interest rate that is necessary to discount the estimated future cash outflows, including all fees and remuneration paid and received that are an integral component of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts, through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period to equal the net carrying amount upon initial recognition. The embedded prepayment option for the Bond is considered to be closely related to the host contract according to IFRS 9. The Group defines “closely related” up to a 5% difference between amortized cost and redemption price as of redemption date. Other financial liabilities, for instance loans accepted, trade payables, and other liabilities, are measured at amortized costs. Trade payables are amounts owed as consideration for goods or services provided to the company in the normal course of business. In the normal business cycle, all liabilities are due in one year or less and are therefore classified as current; otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities. For current liabilities, that means they are measured at their repayment or settlement amount, while non-current liabilities and long-term debts are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing financial liabilities are measured at their settlement value or nominal value. The Group derecognizes a financial liability when the related obligation has been paid, cancelled, or has expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. F 121 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The provision is recognized at an amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated future restoration obligations. The restoration obligations are recognized as part of the cost of the leasehold improvements for the corresponding amount. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that is commensurate to the maturity and risk profile. The unwinding of the discount is expensed as incurred and recognized as an interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income.,N/A,as_expected,2022,469

The acquisition qualifies as a Share Based Payment under IFRS 2, the manager’s interests in the partnership are recognized as an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement in the financial statements of the Group. As the investments in the partnership were acquired at fair value, no expense will be recognized as a result of this transaction. The participation rights in form of partnership interest were acquired from an entity outside the Group and the Group has no obligation to make any payments on the partnership interests to the Managers. The sharebased payment arrangements are fully vested at grant date. The exit constitutes a performance vesting condition which is considered non-market performance condition.

In the current environment, the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners are paramount. On March 16, the Free State of Bavaria declared an official case of emergency and the German government and the state premiers announced further serious restrictions on public life, both of which led to the closure of non-systemically relevant shops. As of March 18, 2020 the Group closed the offline stores in Germany. The offline store in Vienna was closed as of March 16, 2020. The Group has launched several actions in order to protect the health of its employees and to ensure business continuity. These measures include the implementation of a dedicated prevention team, restrictions on business travel, the significant expansion of mobile working and virtual meetings as well as the adaptation of the warehouse shift organisation to reduce and/or avoid contact amongst employees. Furthermore, prudent cash management especially with regards to merchandise purchasing and CAPEX spending including logistics are at the centre of all business decisions. The Group applied for short-time work for the employees in the German retail stores in March as well as for the Headquarter in Aschheim and for the Austrian Store in Vienna in April. Other business areas may be affected in the second quarter as well. The Group’s online business BestSecret and the central warehouse near Munich remained fully operational in order to serve the BestSecret customers. The right to return was extended to 30 days (previous 14 days). The Group also actively monitors any opportunities arising from more favourable buying offers due to increased overstock on the supply side, as well as an accelerated shift towards e-commerce on the customer side.

Solid Growth Moderate Growth EBIT Growth ..................................................................... Solid Growth Moderate Growth For conducting the Impairment test, the total carrying amount of the cash-generating units is checked against the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the fair value less costs to sell, based on discounted future cash flows. Expected cash flows are based on a qualified planning process, with due consideration given to internal experience values and external macroeconomic data. The detailed planning period covers five years, as a general rule. Generally, a growth rate between 1.0% and 2.0% is applied for the time after the five-year period. As a general rule, the discount factor is calculated as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) by application of the capital asset pricing model. For this purpose, an individual group of comparison companies (“peer group”) is applied for all groups of cash-generating units operating in the same business segment. The individual business risk is reflected through the use of specific beta-factor. The beta-factor is calculated annually based on freely available market data. Furthermore, the discount factors are determined on the basis of the following exemplary assumptions: a base interest rate of 0,3% (PY: 1.0%) and a market risk premium of 7.50% (PY: 6.50%) at December 31, 2019 for a term of 25 years in Germany. Country-typical risk premiums are applied to both the equity capital cost rate and the debt capital cost rate, based on the credit rating of the respective country. For purposes of estimating the development of revenues, EBIT and the EBIT margin, specific growth rates were assumed in conducting the Impairment test of the respective CGUs. The calculation of sustainably attainable earnings is based on assumptions regarding various cost reduction measures. Furthermore, customary market EBIT margins were assumed for calculating the sustainably attainable earnings. In addition to the Impairment test, three sensitivity analyses were conducted. For the first sensitivity analysis, the discount factor was increased by 0.5 percentage points (PY: 0.5 ppt) for each cash-generating unit. For the second sensitivity analysis, a flat-rate deduction of 10% (PY: 10%) was applied to the assumed EBITDA Margin in perpetuity. The third sensitivity analysis included a reduction of the growth rate in terminal value by 0.5 percentage points. The increase in WACC by 0.5 percentage points in the underlying assumptions would result in an impairment loss for the CGU Store Munich in an amount of -4.819 KEUR and the CGU Store Dornach in an amount of -4,861 KEUR. A flat-rate deduction of 10% in perpetuity from an EBITDA Margin of 11.9% to an EBITDA Margin of 10.7% would result in an impairment loss for the CGU Store Munich in an amount of -3,792 KEUR and the CGU Store Dornach in an amount of -3.969 KEUR. A reduction of the growth rate in terminal value by 0.5 percentage points would cause an impairment loss for the CGU Store Munich in an amount of -3.599 KEUR and the CGU Store Dornach in an amount of -3.801 KEUR.",N/A,as_expected,2022,469
